Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year mathematics project will develop and evaluate                  
              a model professional development program for high school                       
              mathematics teachers from twenty schools in three districts in                 
              the San Jose, California, area.  The project is designed to                    
              provide 80 teacher leaders with the knowledge, skills, and                     
              understandings necessary to lead  implementation of curriculum                 
              innovations in their schools.  Participants will be involved                   
              in three levels of summer institutes and extensive academic                    
              year follow-up sessions that involve leadership training,                      
              staff and peer coaching, demonstration lessons, micro-                         
              teaching, reflection about teaching and learning mathematics,                  
              and development of site-based Professional Development                         
              Centers.  Participants will refresh and enhance their content                  
              knowledge, teach and evaluate innovative curricula, work to                    
              integrate technology into their teaching, and use analysis and                 
              application of mathematics education research, reflective                      
              essays, journals, peer coaching,and discussions to reflect on                  
              and broaden their beliefs about teaching and learning                          
              mathematics.  The participants will present inservice to other                 
              teachers and will become coordinators of the Professional                      
              Development Centers, which will serve, after the project ends,                 
              as the site for the school's ongoing program for staff                         
              development and curricular and instructional change.                           
              Contributions by the university and school districts will                      
              provide a cost share of approximately 39%.
