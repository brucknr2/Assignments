Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Exploratorium requests support for four nationally                         
              recognized installation artists to develop scientifically                      
              relevant, interactive exhibits that will model the movements of                
              waves, clouds, and flowing water and their interplay on and with               
              the Earth's surface.  By manipulating or enhancing the behavior                
              of these simulated elemental forces, changing their scale or the               
              perspective from which they are observed, or slowing down or                   
              speeding up their natural processes, the artists can bring out                 
              characteristics not easily observed, normally.  Cross-                         
              referenced to other Exploratorium exhibits, these pieces will                  
              form the center of a subset of exhibits on the physics of fluid                
              motion and the interaction of elemental forces.  They will serve               
              as a starting point for exploring the physical conditions that                 
              can cause and support the natural phenomena modeled by the                     
              artists.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              We will develop two different kinds of dissemination materials:                
              1) A publication for museum professionals, addressing the use of               
              art in presenting science to the public.  2) Printed guides                    
              which will designate environmentally relevant exhibits at the                  
              Exploratorium dealing with aspects fluid movements in nature.                  
              These new "Pathways" will be intended for children and will be                 
              made available to students coming on Field Trips and the general               
              public.  They will be produced in coordination with two other                  
              Pathways on Energy and distributed in packets entitled "Energy                 
              and the Environment."
