Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This leadership project from California State University, San                  
              Bernadino, is designed to address the science education needs                  
              of a local district with 59% minority (largely Hispanic)                       
              students.  Eighty teachers and twenty bilingual aides of                       
              grades 3-6 will participate in three academic quarters of                      
              weekly meetings (approximately 132 hours) during which time                    
              they will receive training from scientists and science                         
              educators in science content and pedagogy.  Inservices will                    
              focus on FOSS materials, which will form the basis of the                      
              school science curriculum, and on strategies designed to                       
              develop language skills (in science) of bilingual and non-                     
              English speaking children.  The project will also include a                    
              partnership with several scientists and engineers from a local                 
              industry.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because                   
              it plans a leadership project designed to enhance the science                  
              knowledge and teaching of participants, and because it targets                 
              teachers and bilingual aids from schools having large numbers                  
              of minority (mostly Hispanic) students.                                        
                                                                                             
              The cost-sharing amount is approximately 15% of the amount                     
              requested from NSF.
