Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This standard renewal project involves six three-week                          
              workshops (2/summer) spread over three summers.  There will                    
              be approximately 25 teachers/workshop.  Thus, a total of 150                   
              elementary teachers (2 per school) will be trained to become                   
              science mentor specialists for 75 Los Angeles area elementary                  
              schools.  The workshops will provide the mentor teachers with                  
              lesson plans and kits of materials for hands-on physical                       
              science units, as well as training to effectively utilize the                  
              units in inservices for colleague teachers at each grade                       
              level.  Two support sessions for all mentor teachers will                      
              occur during the academic year following the workshop.                         
                                                                                             
              This leadership project is appropriate for the Teacher                         
              Enhancement Program because it enhances the physical science                   
              education of elementary and middle school teachers and                         
              because it includes a practical plan for participants to                       
              provide science inservice for all of the teachers in their                     
              respective schools.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 30% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
