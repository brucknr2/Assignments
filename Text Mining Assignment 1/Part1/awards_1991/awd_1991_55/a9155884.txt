Abstract    :
              An introductory course is being developed that provides contact                
              between freshmen and Electrical and Computer Engineering                       
              faculty and demonstrates the relationship between science and                  
              mathematics fundamentals and their application in a rigorous                   
              program of study.  A primary goal of the project is to reduce                  
              attrition between fifteen and twenty-five percent.  The major                  
              objectives of the proposed course are development of problem                   
              solving skills, a better understanding of how calculus and                     
              physics relate to engineering, and an understanding of the use                 
              of computers in problem solving.  A textbook is being prepared                 
              for the course.  A comprehensive study of student retention is                 
              being performed along with an evaluation of the resources                      
              necessary for full-scale implementation.  During the summer of                 
              1993, a one-week workshop is planned with participants from                    
              Texas universities, community colleges and high schools.                       
              Results of the workshop will be widely disseminated and an                     
              advisory committee will be formed in consultation with the                     
              National Science Foundation and workshop participants.
