Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of the Sacred Heart will initiate a five-week,                  
              residential Young Scholars project in the Life Sciences which will             
              offer science enrichment activities for 15 precollege students                 
              entering grades 9-12.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This program will emphasize research on environmental issues.  The             
              project focus is interdisciplinary in nature and stresses the                  
              development of research skills.  Through lectures on scientific                
              issues and contact with specialists, participants will be presented            
              with a broad spectrum of scientific careers and encouraged to                  
              establish a career goal.
