Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Carnegie Mellon University will initiate a six-week, residential               
              Young Scholars project in Engineering, Biology and Biotechnology               
              which will offer science enrichment activities for 50 precollege               
              students entering grades 10-12.                                                
                                                                                             
              The Young Scholars project will be an extension of an ongoing,                 
              successful course in Carnegie Mellon's Summer precollege program               
              called Careers in Applied Science and Technology (CAST).  The                  
              current CAST program includes a variety of laboratory visits and               
              presentations, a Science/Technology/Society workshop, and a science            
              writing workshop, leading up to the production of a magazine for               
              use in middle school classrooms.  The expanded program will add                
              research tracks in three major NSF Centers on campus and replace               
              most of the science-writing activity with group laboratory                     
              projects.
