Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Bakken, A Library and Museum of Electricity in Life, will                  
              offer a four-year enhancement program for twenty (20) under-                   
              prepared science teachers in physics and physical sciences,                    
              grades 8-12.  The program covers optics, acoustics, and                        
              electricity in a series of five-week institutes conducted at                   
              The Bakken in Minneapolis, Minnesota, followed by a year of                    
              independent study by the teachers and results in graduate                      
              credits from the University of Minnesota.                                      
                                                                                             
              The program focus is designed to increase hands-on                             
              experimentation and to stress the investigative nature of the                  
              experiments through an historical approach.  Students will                     
              repeat famous discoveries using inexpensive copies of                          
              historical instruments and explore links between physics,                      
              mathematics, biology, and art.  As a follow-up to the project,                 
              teachers will continue to be supplied with instructional                       
              materials and samples of new instruments, and receive issues                   
              of a newsletter in which teachers share information and                        
              experiences.
