Abstract    :
              A study-group based learning system is being introduced into                   
              the general chemistry course at the University of Connecticut.                 
              The large lecture classes are broken into study groups of 3-5                  
              students.  Faculty, graduate assistants, and undergraduates                    
              act as monitors of study groups, which meet once weekly.  Study                
              group members responsible for assigned problems present and                    
              explain their solution. Each person also submits a quiz                        
              question similar to his or her assigned problem.  After                        
              modification by the monitor, one of these questions are used as                
              a future quiz question for the class.  Another feature of the                  
              study groups is the distribution of a worksheet which the study                
              groups work on together. The worksheet requires the students to                
              solve problems without benefit of text, thereby simulating                     
              examination conditions.
