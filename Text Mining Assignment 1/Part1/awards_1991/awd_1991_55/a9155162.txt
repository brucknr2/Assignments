Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of the NSF grant is to support the production of                   
              "the Scientist:, an hour-long film in a six-part television                    
              series entitled RENAISSANCE.  Designed to appeal to non-                       
              specialists -- the general public as well as high school and                   
              college students -- the film will recreate the ge of the                       
              Renaissance by drawing on a mixture of animation; documentary                  
              footage of historic sites and art; interviews with contemporary                
              figures who represent the continuing influence of the                          
              Renaissance; and actors speaking the words of the period.                      
              Viewers will thus hear the words of great figures; see the                     
              results of their work; and be treated to re-enactments that                    
              evoke their lives.  Like al the films in the series, "The                      
              Scientist" will trace an important theme of the Renaissance --                 
              in this case, the birth of modern science -- using all aspects                 
              of its society and culture to convey both a sense of the past                  
              and a perspective on the present.  'thanks to the rich materials               
              of the age, and the lively confrontations it witnessed, a modern               
              audience will come to understand both the origins of the                       
              scientific outlook and -- through the interviews with                          
              contemporary scientists -- how it continues to shape our world.
