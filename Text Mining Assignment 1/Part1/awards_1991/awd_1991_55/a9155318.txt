Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a three and one half year program to enhance                   
              the teaching of 75 secondary biology teachers from six                         
              counties in the state of New York.  This will be                               
              accomplished via three, three week, summer institutes to be                    
              held at Elmira College and by follow-up support services                       
              offered during the following academic years.                                   
                                                                                             
              The program will emphasize an experimental,                                    
              multidisciplinary, hands-on approach to the teaching of                        
              secondary biology; cooperative learning will also be                           
              employed.  Four content areas will be covered in each summer                   
              institute, including biochemistry, human physiology,                           
              molecular biology and immunology.  The primary objectives of                   
              the program include curriculum enhancement and tie-in to                       
              other scientific disciplines, development of a more                            
              experimental outlook on biology, and increased creativity                      
              skills.                                                                        
              Project staff will monitor implementation progress during                      
              the academic year and will be available to assist                              
              participants in this phase of the project.                                     
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 17.7% of the NSF award.
