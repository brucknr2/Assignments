Abstract    :
              Chemistry and BiologyThis project expands the interactive                      
              component of an integrated freshman chemistry/biology                          
              curriculum.  The project involves the creation of an                           
              interactive computer learning library that incorporates                        
              educational research findings into its design.  Curriculum                     
              integration comprises themes such as energy transformation and                 
              dynamic equilibrium, which span and unify the sciences. Linked                 
              materials will span several levels of sophistication, allowing                 
              a diverse student population the opportunity to explore                        
              relationships among concepts in a nonlinear self-paced                         
              fashion.  Reading assignments from handouts and the HyperCard                  
              library will drive discussion-based classes.  This will allow                  
              more time to engage students in developing specific thinking                   
              skills necessary to become independent learners.  The Thinking-                
              Aloud Pair-Problem-Solving Method (TAPPS) will be used to help                 
              students gain qualitative familiarity with concepts and                        
              encourage them to examine their own approaches to constructing                 
              solutions to problems.
