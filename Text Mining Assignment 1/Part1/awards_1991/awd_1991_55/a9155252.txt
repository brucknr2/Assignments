Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project, sponsored by Texas A&M University,                    
              provides a four week summer program each year for 32                           
              psychology teachers to prepare them to teach the advanced                      
              placement psychology course.  The summer program will cover                    
              all the major areas of psychology but emphasis will be given                   
              on those areas known to receive insufficient coverage in the                   
              typical high school course.  Topics included will be                           
              cognition, neuropsychology, sensation and perception and                       
              research methods.  The summer program will generate a wide                     
              variety of materials for conducting an honors psychology                       
              course emphasizing active learning exercises which can be                      
              used to establish a laboratory component for the course.  The                  
              project will result in more courses offered at the high                        
              school level which provide a more accurate understanding of                    
              the scientific method, particularly as it applies to the                       
              science of psychology.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project is supported by matching funds from the                           
              university which are equivalent to 28% of the NSF grant.
