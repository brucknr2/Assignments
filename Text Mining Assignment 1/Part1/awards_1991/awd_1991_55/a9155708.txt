Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project seeks to identify aspects critical to the                         
              design of computer simulations for teaching sophisticated                      
              physical concepts to students in introductory physics                          
              classes.  The progression from pedagogically simple systems                    
              to complex systems that more closely model nature requires                     
              that students come to believe that equations represent                         
              reality.  Graphical representations show promise in being                      
              the best way to connect physical systems and the equations                     
              that describe them.  Allowing students to build many of                        
              their own graphical representations serves to validate                         
              simulations as models of nature, aid student discussion, and                   
              alter student misconceptions.  We will draw on                                 
              representations and analogies that scientists find                             
              particularly fruitful, but are not currently included in                       
              introductory physics courses.  We plan to investigate the                      
              potential of new graphical tools such as three-dimensional                     
              displays and manipulations, alternative input devices, and                     
              video storage devices for displaying physical systems which                    
              students can model.
