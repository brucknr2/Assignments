              Abstract                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Hofstra University is offering a four-year program in                          
              mathematics content and pedagogy for 50 middle school teachers                 
              in the New York City - Long Island metropolitan area.  The                     
              project offers a coordinated collection of mathematics courses                 
              over four summers and additional courses and other follow-up                   
              and leadership activities during the intervening academic                      
              years.  The project is designed to allow less well-prepared                    
              middle school teachers to enter the project starting in the                    
              second academic year.  Modeling of effective teaching methods                  
              will be a feature of all courses, as will the integration of                   
              the use of technology.  Participants will receive resource                     
              materials and computer software to use in their own                            
              classrooms.  Hofstra University and participating school                       
              districts will provide cost sharing of approximately 33% of                    
              the requested budget.
