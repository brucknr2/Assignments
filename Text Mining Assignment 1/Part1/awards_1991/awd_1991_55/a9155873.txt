Abstract    :
              Text and materials for a freshman/sophomore-level geometry                     
              course are being developed.  The course will stress descriptive                
              geometry (draping three-dimensional objects, understanding                     
              perspective), tiling and polyhedra (symmetry, strip patterns,                  
              wallpaper groups, space filling shapes), curvature, Euler                      
              characteristic, geometry and the creative arts, exploring                      
              geometry through the method of guided discovery. It will be                    
              designed to meet the needs of prospective elementary and                       
              secondary school teachers.The project builds on work begun with                
              the help of the Exxon Foundation.  It includes participation by                
              instructors at a variety of colleges with whom Cornell has                     
              established ties. The project goal is to produce, field test                   
              and commercially publish nineteen units of text, and course                    
              materials.
