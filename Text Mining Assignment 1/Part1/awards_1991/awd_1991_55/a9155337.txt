Abstract    :
              9155337  Shultz    Orange County Superintendent of Schools Office is conducting
              a  three-year school-based staff development project for high school 
              mathematics teachers in eight selected schools in Orange County.   The first
              summer four teachers selected from each of the eight  schools will participate
              in a summer program involving examination  of new and innovative instructional
              materials, development of  instructional units, trying out the materials and
              units in a  laboratory summer class of students who have completed eighth 
              grade, and working with university mathematicians to better  understand the
              mathematics concepts woven into the new curriculum.   During the following
              school year, the teachers will be given the  time and support necessary for
              them to assume leadership in the  incorporation of the new curriculum in their
              schools.  In  subsequent years additional teachers will be brought from the 
              targeted schools will be brought into the program, with preceding  participants
              serving as mentors for the new participants.  The goal  of the project is to
              achieve full participation and significant  change in the mathematics programs
              and teaching at each of the  eight schools and to study the processes inherent
              in such change.    The budget requested for the project is $768,763, and cost
              share  provided by the districts is $284,508, or 37% of the requested  budget.
