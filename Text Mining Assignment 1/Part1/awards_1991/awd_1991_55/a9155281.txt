Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Challenger Center for Space Science Education located in                   
              Alexandria, Virginia, a nonprofit organization with a mission to               
              increase the number of youth interested in science and space, is               
              requesting $303,170 over two years from the National Science                   
              Foundation (NSF) to develop a new scenario for its Challenger                  
              Learning Centers.  Located in science centers. museums and                     
              schools around the country. Learning Centers house equipment and               
              educational programming for hands-on training during a simulated               
              mission.  Scenarios use mathematics, science and problem-solving               
              skills to provide participants with simulated experiences of                   
              working in a space laboratory and a "Mission control"                          
              laboratory.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Challenger Center requests assistance and partnership from NSF                 
              to develop, field test, implement and evaluate a new scenario on               
              the environment, "Mission to Planet Earth" scenario.  This                     
              project will involve collaboration of expert scientists,                       
              educators, Challenger staff, and science museum professionals.                 
              Annually more than 180,000 students and between 10,000 and                     
              15,000 adults will participate in the scenario at Learning                     
              Centers, using space as a format for learning about                            
              environmental issues.  Challenger is working on the preliminary                
              planning stage between June and December 1991.  Two years of                   
              funding are requested from NSF beginning in January 1992.
