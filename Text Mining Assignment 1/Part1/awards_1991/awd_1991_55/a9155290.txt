Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Through the proposed project, approximately 555,000 youth and                  
              adults will improve their knowledge of the basic sciences and                  
              mathematics, and learn to integrate and apply these disciplines,               
              by analyzing local environmental problems using remote sensing                 
              imagery and maps.  Faculty from the Cornell laboratory for                     
              Environmental Applications of Remote Sensing (CLEARS) and                      
              Cornell Department of Natural Resources will train county teams                
              of teachers, museum and nature center educators, community                     
              leaders, and Cooperative Extension agents from throughout New                  
              York State to conduct educational programs with youth and adults               
              in their communities.  Previously developed CLEARS educator                    
              enrichment workshops and training materials will be enhanced and               
              revised based on the interactions among Cornell Faculty,                       
              informal and formal science educators, and students during this                
              program.  A facultative evaluation focusing on the workshops,                  
              training materials, and educator teaching skills, and a                        
              summative evaluation focusing on student learning and attitudes,               
              program delivery in the various community education settings,                  
              and the effectiveness of the county educator teams will be                     
              conducted.  The results of the evaluation will be incorporated                 
              into a program handbook and used in nationwide dissemination of                
              the program.
