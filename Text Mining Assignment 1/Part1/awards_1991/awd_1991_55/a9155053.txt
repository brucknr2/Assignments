Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The GMI Engineering and Management Institute will initiate a three-            
              week, commuter Young Scholars project in Physics for 30 students               
              entering grade 9.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The selected students will participate in classroom discussions                
              about various sources of energy such as coal, gasoline, nuclear and            
              solar.  Through hands-on experiments they will learn about the                 
              basic properties of light and electricity; these concepts will be              
              used in understanding solar power.  They will perform several                  
              experiments to understand solar motors and solar cell efficiency.              
              Hands-on experiments will also be performed in environmental                   
              chemistry where students will learn about carbon dioxide gas                   
              emission, the greenhouse effect, ozone layer depletion and toxic               
              waste.  Principles and operations of computers (both PC and                    
              mainframe) along with BASIC programming skills will be developed.              
              Students will undertake research projects in physics and chemistry             
              and write research papers about their findings.
