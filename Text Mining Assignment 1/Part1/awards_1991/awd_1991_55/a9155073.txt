Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ball State University will initiate a four-week, residential Young             
              Scholars project in Physics and Engineering for 24 students                    
              entering grades 11 and 12.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Instructional workshop materials will emphasize the use of                     
              electronic instrumentation such as oscilloscopes and meters as well            
              as the use of integrated circuits as modules in building electronic            
              circuits.  During the on-campus portion of the workshop the                    
              students will be divided into six independent research groups and              
              each group will develop a research project to be completed by the              
              end of the fourth week.  Each participant will be given a kit of               
              electronic components and reference materials which they will use              
              during their follow-up activities.
