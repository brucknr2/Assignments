Abstract    :
              The Department of chemistry is introducing cooperative guided                  
              inquiry laboratories into the general chemistry course.  The                   
              students are forgoing twelve, individually performed,                          
              traditional one laboratory period exercises in order to work in                
              groups on selected research oriented projects per semester.                    
              During the course of the semester, students apply their problem                
              solving skills to projects approximating the research process                  
              as closely as possible.  In addition to learning how to                        
              recognize fruitful approaches to scientific investigations and                 
              to plan experiments, the students also use both their written                  
              and oral communication skills to critique and evaluate their                   
              results.
