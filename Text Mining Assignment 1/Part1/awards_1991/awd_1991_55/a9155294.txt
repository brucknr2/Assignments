Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a four summer program to provide inservice                     
              education, in the areas of cellular and molecular biology                      
              and biotechnology, for 192 (48 per year) general and                           
              advanced level high school biology teachers from Arizona and                   
              surrounding states.  Special attention will be given to the                    
              recruitment of teachers of minority students and to the                        
              needs of minority students.  Emphasis will also be placed on                   
              giving biology teachers the competency and confidence to                       
              emphasize modern biotechnology in the classroom,                               
              incorporating laboratory investigations to their fullest,                      
              and also to the use of computer and media technology in                        
              biology education.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The program is based upon several years of pilot study and                     
              includes a three week summer institute at Northern Arizona                     
              University and academic year follow-up.  Highly qualified,                     
              experienced, precollege teachers will provide a significant                    
              portion of the institute instruction.  Participants will be                    
              required to share activities with fellow teachers via local                    
              inservice activities.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 9.3% of the NSF award.
