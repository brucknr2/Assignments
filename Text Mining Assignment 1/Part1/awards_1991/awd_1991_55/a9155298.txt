Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 5-year, district-wide leadership project is a cooperative                 
              effort of Eastern Washington University (EWU) and the Spokane                  
              School District No. 81 (SD 81), and involves an extensive                      
              program of science education for elementary school teachers to                 
              support the district's plan to dramatically restructure the                    
              elementary school science curriculum.  Each of the 36 district                 
              schools and approximately 10 participating private elementary                  
              schools will form a school-wide implementation team including                  
              the principal, two lead teachers, and members of the school's                  
              instructional team.  The 92 lead teachers will participate in                  
              a 4-week summer institute, follow-up meetings during the                       
              academic year, and an additional 2-week institute during a                     
              subsequent summer.  In addition to serving as resource                         
              teachers and members of their school's implementation team,                    
              lead teachers will assist project staff in developing and                      
              presenting short courses and workshops to support                              
              implementation of the science curriculum.  A number of                         
              different levels and types of short courses will be provided                   
              for the approximately 760 classroom teachers, to suit                          
              different levels of teacher interest and commitment.                           
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because of its systemic plan to enhance in a                           
              substantive way the science teaching of all K-6 teachers in                    
              the Spokane school system.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The cost-sharing amount is approximately 76% of the amount                     
              requested from NSF.
