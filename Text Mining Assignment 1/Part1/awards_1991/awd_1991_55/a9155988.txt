Abstract    :
              Physical science majors at UCLA have deceased monotonically for                
              20 years. The UCLA Science Challenge has accepted as its                       
              mission four goals: 1) retain current science majors, 2)                       
              recruit new science majors, 3) attract minority students to                    
              science, and 4) improve student attitudes toward science. UCLA                 
              serves an unusually diverse student body chosen from the top                   
              12.5% of California high school graduates. Every student enters                
              qualified to major in science. The six departments that                        
              comprise the UCLA Science Challenge, Astronomy, Atmospheric                    
              Science, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Earth and Space Science,                  
              Mathematics, and Physics, taught approximately 6000                            
              undergraduate students in lower-division courses last year.                    
              More than 20% of these students are Black or Hispanic. We have                 
              the student contact; we have an awesome opportunity. We have                   
              focused on lower-division courses and laboratories, and we have                
              experimented with methods. We find that interactive, computer-                 
              based materials provide the most effective and the most popular                
              laboratory instruction. Interactive seminars and discussion                    
              sessions, which have students at a computer terminal, have                     
              proved exceptionally effective in teaching. Computationally                    
              intensive demonstration programs created at UCLA have generated                
              excitement in lectures. We are now converting these                            
              demonstration programs to interactive student programs. Using                  
              these experiences, we developed and implemented three new                      
              prototype courses in Astronomy, Atmospheric Science, and                       
              Chemistry using interactive program modules. Student response                  
              exceeded our wildest hopes. Cognitive Psychology evaluates our                 
              teaching effectiveness and assesses student attitudes. We now                  
              are now radically overhauling our lower-division science based                 
              on the creation of 11 new courses and 18 new interdisciplinary                 
              laboratory modules.
