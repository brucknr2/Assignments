Abstract    :
              Westchester Community College (WCC) proposes to initiate a                     
              three-year project toincrease the numbers of students entering the             
              mathematics, science, and engineering fieldsthrough the use of                 
              mathematical modeling.  The more students who enter these fields,              
              themore apt is the country likely to regain its economic                       
              leadership.The college will provide an early exposure to                       
              mathematical modeling--the first time at acommunity college--in                
              order to make mathematics more interesting, exciting, and                      
              relevant.A manual on mathematical modeling will be developed,                  
              refined, and disseminated widely. It will be used as the basis for             
              establishing an elective course in mathematical modelingat WCC.  It            
              will also be used to coach teams of students who will participate              
              in the annualmathematical modeling competition.A national                      
              conference will be conducted to provide wide exposure to                       
              mathematicalmodeling at community colleges.  The Principal                     
              Investigator will assist other colleges toinitiate course in                   
              mathematical modeling and to establish student teams for entry into            
              thecompetitions.
