Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program provides opportunity for high school biology                      
              teachers to spend a summer doing research, full-time, in the                   
              laboratory of a member of the American Society of Biochemistry                 
              and Molecular Biology (ASBMB).  This nationwide program                        
              emphasizes the identification and selection of highly motivated                
              teachers who will return to their home schools and have a                      
              continuing impact on the quality of science education through the              
              implementation of innovative topics and hands-on exercises.                    
              Emphasis is placed on the recruitment of teachers from schools                 
              that serve large numbers of minority students.  On the basis of                
              previous experience, it is anticipated that this program will                  
              have an impact on science education at the secondary level and                 
              have at least an indirect impact on career choices made by some                
              secondary students.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 180 % of the NSF award.
