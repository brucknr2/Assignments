Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal provides a plan for enhancing the level of                       
              knowledge and skills in basic science for 75 secondary                         
              agriscience teachers.  The project is for three years and                      
              will include the following: development of a yearly summer                     
              institute in basic and applied science concepts; the                           
              methodology of teaching science; and curriculum materials                      
              development designed to integrate the scientific concepts                      
              and teaching methodologies of the institute.                                   
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 51% of the NSF award.
