Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This project, housed at Case Western Reserve University in                     
              Cleveland, Ohio, focuses on the training of 75 under-prepared                  
              high school physics teachers in an intensive summer program                    
              plus an academic year component which includes a new course on                 
              "Teaching Physics Concepts" and follow up sessions utilizing                   
              experienced teachers as mentors.  Building on a previous                       
              project which involved 175 teachers, emphasis is placed on                     
              hands-on activities including the building and performing of                   
              inexpensive demonstrations. Continuing project activities                      
              include the replication of the program on a local basis by the                 
              participants to multiply the number of teachers affected.
