Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program, sponsored by the Catholic University of                          
              America, will provide a two-year summer workshop for 50                        
              less well-prepared teachers of chemistry from the                              
              Washington D.C. region.  The target group is minority                          
              teachers or teachers of minority students.  Also included                      
              in the project is a follow up program during the academic                      
              year between the two summer sessions which will emphasize                      
              implementation of the techniques learned in the summer.                        
              The teachers will study chemistry content, learning theory                     
              and instructional strategies for learning chemistry                            
              concepts.  Lecture, pedagogy and laboratory activities will                    
              be integrated throughout.  In the laboratory component of                      
              the project teachers will learn about microchemistry                           
              techniques, computer-lab interfacing, demonstration                            
              activities and instrumentation.                                                
                                                                                             
              The University is providing a match to the NSF funds
