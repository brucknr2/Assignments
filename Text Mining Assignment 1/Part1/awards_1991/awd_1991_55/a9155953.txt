Abstract    :
              This project proposes to alter the philosophy and approach to                  
              laboratory training in biology at the introductory level.                      
              Changes in the laboratory component in the first semester of a                 
              two-semester sequence will allow students to participate in a                  
              small number of non-traditional, investigative laboratories in                 
              evolutionary, environmental and behavioral biology. Each module                
              directly relates to and prepares science majors for modern                     
              research-oriented upper-division courses.  The intent of these                 
              modules is to (1) expose students to basic questions in                        
              biology, (2) give direct experience with scientific methods                    
              including statistical analysis and use of modern research                      
              technologies, and (3) increase expertise in evaluating primary,                
              as well as secondary publications in science.  During the final                
              week of each module students will interpret data and draw                      
              conclusions and in selected modules will design their own                      
              original investigations based on previous experimentation,                     
              observation and data collection. This project more clearly                     
              parallels modern research than the traditional weekly menu-                    
              driven laboratory. The time/space flexibilities and increased                  
              student/faculty/staff contact will accommodate individualized                  
              learning and will address the needs of a student cohort with                   
              disparate secondary school educations and socioeconomic                        
              backgrounds.
