Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Texas @ Austin will initiate a nine-week,                    
              residential, multidisciplinary Young Scholars project which will               
              offer science enrichment activities for 80 precollege students                 
              entering grades 11 and 12.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize research participation in                   
              biology, chemistry, biochemistry and physics, broadly defined to               
              include related disciplines in the natural sciences, pharmacy,                 
              exercise physiology, experimental psychology, nutritional sciences             
              and engineering.  Each participant will build and use their own                
              IBM-compatible computer during the program.  Research participation            
              will involve each student as a member of an active research team.              
              Activities will include seminars on scientific ethics, the                     
              relevance of science to problems confronting mankind and society,              
              and career choices, plus short courses and special sessions aimed              
              at the development of productivity skills.
