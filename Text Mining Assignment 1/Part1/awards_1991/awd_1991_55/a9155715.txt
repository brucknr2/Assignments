Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The project will use artificial intelligence techniques                   
              to construct a prototype computer system to support and                        
              coach scientific argumentation.  Running in a network                          
              environment, the system will help students engage in a                         
              variety of science-related argumentation activities,                           
              including discussing (a) competing theories and the                            
              implications of simulated or real experiment they have                         
              carried out and (b) implications of scientific knowledge for                   
              public policy issues.  Students will be able to build,                         
              examine, and refine arguments using several different                          
              knowledge based tools and will be able to seek advice on                       
              which parts of complex arguments deserve more attention, and                   
              why.  The prototype will address several specific scientific                   
              and policy topics in the areas of global warming and plate                     
              tectonics.  We will test the system with urban middle or                       
              high school students and with non-science-major                                
              undergraduates and develop a clear plan for building                           
              authoring tools and a run-time environment that could be                       
              used to develop similar tools for other domains.
