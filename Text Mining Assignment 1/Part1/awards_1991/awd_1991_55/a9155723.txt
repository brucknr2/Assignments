Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  By capitalizing on many of the same advances developed                    
              by astronomers for the present generation of powerful                          
              research telescopes, we have created a low-cost, computer-                     
              driven, automated imaging telescope.  This MicroObservatory                    
              is a marvelous tool  for original nighttime observations, as                   
              well as for daytime use.  This proposal requests support to                    
              develop a network of these portable instruments which will                     
              allow students to contribute to current research in                            
              astronomy.  To test this idea we will organize a group of                      
              research astronomers and active semi-professional amateurs                     
              to oversee observational programs for which the                                
              MicroObservatory is particularly suited; train teachers in                     
              its use; and implement a system whereby students can collect                   
              data, use Internet to transmit it to a central research                        
              database, and share in the analysis of data collected from                     
              many sites.
