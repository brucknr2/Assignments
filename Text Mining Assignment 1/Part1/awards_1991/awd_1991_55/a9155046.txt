Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Colorado School of Mines will initiate a three-week,                       
              residential, "Early Alert" Young Scholars project in Mathematics               
              for thirty American Indian middle school students entering grades              
              7 and 8.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The program will be held jointly with a Teacher Enhancement project            
              that is sponsored with institutional funds.  Emphasis is on                    
              critical thinking, problem solving, use of similar triangles and               
              trigonometry to estimate heights attained by student-constructed               
              rockets, and use of LOGO to create American Indian designs and                 
              tessellations.  Students complete a research project with the                  
              advice of a professional mentor from AT&T Bell Laboratories.                   
              Career exploration and higher educational goals are an integral                
              part of the program.
