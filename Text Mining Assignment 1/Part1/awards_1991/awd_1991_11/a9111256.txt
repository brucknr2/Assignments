Abstract    :
              This is a Research Initiation Award dealing with a wind                        
              power generating system.  The proposal presents a                              
              novel configuration of a variable speed wind power                             
              generating system consisting of a doubly-excited                               
              brushless reluctance machine and a low power rating                            
              converter.  With this unique configuration, rotor                              
              windings and brushes of the electric machine are                               
              eliminated.  In addition, the power converter controls                         
              both active and reactive power to provide improved                             
              control flexibility.
