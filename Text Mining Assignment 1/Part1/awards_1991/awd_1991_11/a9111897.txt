Abstract    :
              Funding is provided to:  (1) Upgrade an existing                               
              molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system by adding two                              
              new furnaces and an in-situ cleaver which will allow                           
              regrowth on the cleaved edge of GaAs/A1GaAs                                    
              heterostructure thin films.  (2) Add a pattern                                 
              generator to an existing electron microscope so that                           
              we can do electron-beam lithography.  These                                    
              upgrades will enhance our capability to fabricate                              
              GaAs/A1GaAs structures and devices with novel                                  
              electrical and optical properties.
