Abstract    :
              The use of immobilized whole cells                                             
              to conduct biochemical conversions                                             
              has increased significantly in the                                             
              last several years. One of the most                                            
              important areas is the effects of                                              
              immobilization on the intrinsic                                                
              metabolism of the cells employed.

              carbon flow, energy production, and                                            
              product formation.  Preliminary                                                
              results have shown that significant                                            
              changes in metabolism occur upon                                               
              immobilization.  E. coli cells

              the hypothesis that immobilization                                             
              changes the relative rates of

              The specific objectives of this                                                
              work are to test the following two                                             
              hypotheses: i) that the excess                                                 
              carbon consumed by immobilized                                                 
              cells is diverted to the synthesis                                             
              of acid byproducts or of inducible                                             
              protein; and ii) that mass transfer                                            
              limitations on the removal of acid

              changes in metabolism.  The                                                    
              ultimate goal is to exploit                                                    
              immobilization-induced metabolic
