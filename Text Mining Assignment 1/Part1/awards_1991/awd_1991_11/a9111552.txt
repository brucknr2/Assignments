Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves two anthropologists from the University of               
              New Mexico in a study of male fertility and parenting in the                   
              contemporary US. The theories tested are drawn from evolutionary               
              models of male parenting practices and fertility, and are                      
              designed to explain the total number of children and the economic              
              and noneconomic resources invested in children by parents. The                 
              researchers use data from structured interviews with a                         
              representative sample of Anglo and Hispanic men over 21 years of               
              age in Albuquerque, NM.  A short interview will be administered                
              to about 10,000 men and a long interview administered to about                 
              2,000 men to obtain fertility, parenting, and income data from                 
              individuals in diverse generations.                                            
                                                                                             
              This research is important because most studies of fertility deal              
              with women. This project will advance our theoretical                          
              understanding of parenting by contributing data on males from                  
              different age and socio-economic cohorts.
