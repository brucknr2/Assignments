Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Receptors are proteins that are involved in the communication                  
              between nerve cells, playing an important role in cellular                     
              activity.  The goal of this research project is to study the                   
              muscarinic receptor, a receptor activated by the chemical release              
              of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which causes different                 
              effects in cells.  Initial studies will be performed to determine              
              which of the five subtypes of the muscarinic receptor alters                   
              cellular activity.  In order to accomplish this, Dr. Jones will                
              develop probes, antibodies that are raised against each of the                 
              muscarinic receptor subtypes.  These probes will attach only to                
              the receptor subtype against which the antibody was raised. It is              
              postulated that these antibodies will prevent the activation of                
              the receptors.  By monitoring the activity induced by the                      
              receptors individually, the antibody can be added, and if the                  
              activity of the receptor is terminated the antibodies are thus                 
              considered useful probes.  Understanding the mechanisms by which               
              these receptors control cellular activity in nerve cells will aid              
              in the understanding of how the brain works.
