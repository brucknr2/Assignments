Abstract    :
                   Could condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration exerts a                    
              profound influence on the earth's atmosphere by directly                       
              affecting cloud albedo.  As a first step toward developing the                 
              needed parameterization of cloud microphysics for global                       
              questions such as the effect of marine aerosol or air pollution                
              on cloud albedo, it is essential to test the internal consistency              
              which must exist between aerosol microphysics, nucleation theory,              
              and direct measurements of CCN concentrations.  The objective of               
              this planning grant is to develop the protocol for such a test.                
              The planning period will be used to investigate and evaluate such              
              topics as:  experimental verification of the relationship                      
              between size, composition, and CCN concentration for particles                 
              containing mixtures of insoluble material, soluble salts, and                  
              organic compounds; measurement of droplet growth rates in                      
              supersaturated environments, including the effects of organic                  
              films; comparisons between nuclei activated in CCN counters and                
              nuclei which have been activated in real clouds.  Sensitivities                
              required in the measurements will be modelled and compared with                
              typical instrumental accuracies.
