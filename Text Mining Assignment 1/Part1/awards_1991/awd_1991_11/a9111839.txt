Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is aimed at fundamental questions regarding the                  
              oxidation behavior and structure of aluminum-lithium alloys.  In               
              the process  of examining these alloys, new characterization                   
              techniques are developed in the use of Secondary Ion Mass                      
              Spectrometry (SIMS).  Specific areas being addressed include: (1)              
              oxidation behavior of aluminum-lithium alloys with emphasis on                 
              nucleation of the oxide, growth phenomena, and lithium depletion;              
              (2) lithium diffusion and solute redistribution in the alloys; and             
              (3) structural and chemical characterization of intermetallic                  
              phases in the alloys.  This research is pertinent to further                   
              development of this important class of metal alloys, and the                   
              characterization techniques being developed are generic to all                 
              materials.  The program is a collaborative research effort                     
              involving the Universities of Chicago and Lehigh and the National              
              Institute of Standards.
