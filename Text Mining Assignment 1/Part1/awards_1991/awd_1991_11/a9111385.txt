Abstract    :
                   This grant will enable the principal investigator to conduct              
              preliminary studies towards the design of an algorithm visualization           
              system.  The end product will be an NSF proposal.  Algorithm                   
              visualization is viewed as a learning framework for the design and             
              analysis of algorithms.  Its purpose is to study and/or monitor                
              algorithm behaviour, considering the algorithm as a black box.  The            
              feasibility of such an exploration environment will be investigated            
              from the point of view of the novice designer.  The aim of such a              
              system will be to allow a novice designer to understand certain key            
              computational limitations and constraints of an algorithm via the use          
              of interactive tools.  Preliminary studies will include a thorough             
              research of the literature, experimentation with a set of graphical            
              simulation techniques, and review of different rip up and reroute              
              layout heuristics.  Cooperation with a senior faculty is being                 
              sought.
