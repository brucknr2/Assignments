Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is the first phase in establishing a Parallel                    
              Applications and Software Laboratory that will be a component of               
              the Indiana University Center for Innovative Computer                          
              Applications (CICA).  This laboratory will build upon the                      
              resources of an established center to provide a facility where a               
              staff of trained people will work directly with scientists from a              
              variety of disciplines to design new parallel applications and to              
              study the effectiveness of specialized tools for parallel                      
              programming, program restructuring and performance visualization.              
                                                                                             
              The research mission of the laboratory will be to use the domain               
              of real world applications to study the problem of designing                   
              scalable parallel software.  Our specific research projects for                
              this laboratory are: (1) To apply and evaluate existing parallel               
              programming tools to real applications in the physical and social              
              sciences.  (2) To investigate the utility of higher level, object              
              oriented abstraction mechanisms in the design of parallel                      
              applications.  In particular, we will use a new programming                    
              methodology based on object oriented design that will allow us to              
              compile programs for a wide variety of massively parallel                      
              architectures.  (3) To extend the state of the art in performance              
              analysis tools so that they are able to predict performance as                 
              machine and problem sizes are scaled.  This involves the design                
              of a new generation of algorithm visualization tools that                      
              incorporates parallel complexity models and static and dynamic                 
              analysis of parallel programs with analytical models of machine                
              behavior.
