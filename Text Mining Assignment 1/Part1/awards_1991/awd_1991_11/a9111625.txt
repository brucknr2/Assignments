Abstract    :
              We propose to acquire thin film deposition and                                 
              characterization equipment for use in our ongoing                              
              and future research programs, including sample                                 
              preparation benches, a modern and flexible sputter                             
              deposition and thermal evaporation system, and                                 
              ellipsometer.  The deposition system will be used to                           
              deposit a variety of conducting (Au,Al,Zn,In,etc.)                             
              and dielectric (ZnO,SiO2,etc.) films and will be used                          
              by a large number of faculty and students.  An                                 
              automated ellipsometer will be used to characterize                            
              the films produced by the deposition system and                                
              our existing chemical vapor deposition (CVD)                                   
              reactors.
