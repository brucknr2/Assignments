Abstract    :
                 A new position/force control decomposition is suggested for                 
              the formulation of control strategies for constrained robot                    
              manipulation.  Separate position and force controllers can be                  
              developed from the corresponding decoupled model for a single n-               
              joint nonredundant manipulator or two cooperating robot arms.                  
              The position controllers can compensate for the associated                     
              uncertainty naturally present in the robot arm dynamics.  This                 
              new control decomposition is utilized to research:  1) the                     
              advantages and disadvantages of different position/force                       
              decompositions, 2) the effects of surface uncertainty in                       
              conjunction with any manipulator dynamic uncertainty, 3) the                   
              advantages and disadvantages of different control schemes through              
              computer simulation and experimentation, 4) the use of multiple                
              sensors in conjunction with advanced position/force controllers,               
              5) the effects of actuator and sensor dynamics on position/force               
              controller performance.  If the above problems can be solved, the              
              integration of robot manipulators into the manufacturing of                    
              automobiles, planes, surface-ships, spacecraft, appliances, etc,               
              will become much easier.
