Abstract    :
                   This research will be to carry out an analytical and                      
              experimental program to study a fractal-based representation of                
              tolerances for discrete part manufacturing processes.  A fractal-              
              based representation does not replace the current view of tolerance            
              control in engineering design and manufacturing.  Instead, such a              
              representation extends current tolerance synthesis and analysis                
              practices by providing a means of determining the physical                     
              interaction of the product design and manufacturing process                    
              variables.                                                                     
                   A novel representation of the experimental data in terms of               
              Karhunen-Loeve expansion will be developed as a means of studying              
              the fractal or integral nature of shape profiles of the workpiece              
              specimens.  The experimental data and Karhunen-Loeve representation            
              will also supply information for comparisons with analytical models            
              of the manufacturing processes.
