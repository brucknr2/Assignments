Abstract    :
              A Research Initiation Award will fund a study of advanced                      
              nondestructive testing of structural materials by acoustic                     
              emission.  A combination of model development and experimental                 
              validation will be used.  The model will use an acoustic signal                
              source which is an actual crack propagation and arrest event and               
              which includes crack location and orientation, crack tip velocity              
              and duration of propagation, component geometry, and mode of                   
              fracture.  The dynamic stresses will be calculated at each point               
              by the integral method.  From the stresses the local dynamic                   
              displacements will be calculated and used to determine the expected            
              acoustic emission signal waveform.
