Abstract    :
              High speed computer workstations will be purchased and dedicated               
              to supporting research in mechanics and materials.  The                        
              Workstations will be used to support several research projects,                
              including in particular:                                                       
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                   o  Mechanical modeling of polymer behavior and simulation                 
                      of polymer processing.                                                 
                                                                                             
                   o  Finite element study of mechanical forces on the growth                
                      plate in bones.                                                        
                                                                                             
                   o  Micromechanics of failure in random microstructures.                   
                                                                                             
                   o  Constitutive modeling of creep in sea ice.
