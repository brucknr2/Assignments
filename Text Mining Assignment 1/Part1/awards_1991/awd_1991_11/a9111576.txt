Abstract    :
              Research will be conducted on phase transitions in frustrated                  
              systems such as spin glasses.  In addition to studying a number of             
              aspects of the spin glass problem, application of spin glass ideas             
              to the issue of the existence of a vortex glass in a type II                   
              superconductor with disorder in a magnetic field will also be                  
              pursued.  This will determine whether high temperature                         
              superconductors have strictly zero resistance in a magnetic field.             
              Work on phase transitions in quantum systems will also be                      
              developed.  In particular, the universal conductance expected at               
              the zero temperature transition between insulating and                         
              superconducting phases in disordered thin films will be                        
              investigated.  Since analytic approaches have turned out to be very            
              complicated for the proposed problems, the emphasis will be on                 
              numerical simulations.                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Numerical techniques will be applied to study phase transitions in             
              a variety of systems in which quantum effects and disorder                     
              dominate.  Included will be studies of spin glasses, vortex glasses            
              in high temperature superconductors and the insulator-                         
              superconductor transition in disordered thin films at zero                     
              temperature.  All of these problems are of great current interest              
              in condensed matter and materials physics.
