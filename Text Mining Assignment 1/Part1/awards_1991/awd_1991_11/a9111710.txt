Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out in                       
              nuclear structure studies using light and heavy ions.  The                     
              interaction mechanisms and formation (in heavy ion reactions)                  
              of complex fragments will be explored.  Data will provide the                  
              basis for phenomenological models of complex light ion                         
              scattering and fragmentation in heavy ion central collisions.                  
              Also, research will be conducted on alpha-particle clustering                  
              and knockout reactions.  This data will be used to extract                     
              spectroscopic information, and to test early hypotheses                        
              regarding alpha clustering in the low-density nuclear surface                  
              region.  Undergraduate student involvement is a very important                 
              element of this research.  Some detector and data acquisition                  
              development, data analysis, interpretation, and other related                  
              activities will be carried out at the University of Michigan                   
              Dearborn Campus.
