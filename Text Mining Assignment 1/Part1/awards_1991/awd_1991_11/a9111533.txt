Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The purpose of this proposal is to fund the participant costs             
              of 6 graduate students and 8 postdoctoral research associates to               
              attend the 14th triennial International Conference on Plant Growth             
              Substances, organized by the International Plant Growth Substance              
              Association (IPGSA).  The conference covers many subject areas                 
              including plant metabolism, plant development, gene regulation,                
              signal transduction, plant stress, host-pathogen interactions,                 
              biotechnology and agricultural applications.                                   
                                                                                             
                   The importance of the attendance of young U.S. scientists at              
              this meeting is twofold.  First, the science is top notch and                  
              scientists come away with enhanced training.  The second is the                
              international aspect and the ability of young scientists to engage             
              foreign colleagues.  A major, high-quality book of the proceedings             
              will be published.//
