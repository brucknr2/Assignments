Abstract    :
              The research addresses free floating planar manipulator design.                
              In this study, the free floating characteristic is provided by                 
              arranging for the manipulator to float on a planar surface on a                
              thin film of air.  Preliminary investigations indicate that the                
              nature of design for such devices is far different from that of                
              corresponding fixed base manipulators.  This project completes the             
              design of a free floating manipulator to be used as an experimental            
              test bed.  Specific research topics include the nature of inverse              
              solutions, the characterization and optimization of workspace, the             
              number of Jacobian singularities, the existence of inertially                  
              singular configurations, and the nature of control algorithms.                 
              Free floating manipulators are required when the end effector has              
              to travel over a large workspace.  This work should contribute to              
              the fields of space and underwater robotics.  This proposal was                
              determined to be highly meritorious, and an award is recommended.
