Abstract    :
              The equipment purchased under this grant will be used in an                    
              interdisciplinary research program in automated and computer                   
              assisted image data interpretation.  The principal components of               
              the program are automated image processing and environmental                   
              remote sensing, all within the college of engineering.                         
              Applications of the requested equipment would lie in the general               
              area of earth and ocean science and global change.  Some examples              
              of existing research are as follows:                                           
                                                                                             
              o  Interpretation of synthetic aperture radar observations of sea              
                 ice.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              o  Satellite remote sensing for the control of tropical diseases.              
                                                                                             
              o  Topographic mapping of Earth's surface via synthetic aperture               
                 radar.
