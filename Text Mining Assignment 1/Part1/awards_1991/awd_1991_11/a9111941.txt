Abstract    :
              The problem of mapping programs to parallel architectures is cast as           
              an optimization problem. This perspective highlights several                   
              inaccuracies in the description of the problem instance that may               
              affect solution quality.  This work evaluates the sensitivity of               
              program partitioning methods to inaccurate estimates of execution              
              time.  Other research has concentrated on evaluating potential                 
              solutions to the overall mapping problem and has ignored the                   
              important effects of such inaccuracies.  The work will further overall         
              understanding of the mapping problem and will help guide the                   
              development of new methods for program mappings.                               
              The evaluation will be accomplished for several classes of programs            
              and target architectures and several partitioning methods.                     
              Experiments will systematically vary the accuracy of execution time            
              estimates used by the partitioning methods.  Actual execution times of         
              the resulting mappings will be measured and analyzed to characterize           
              the sensitivity of the partitioning methods to inaccurate execution            
              time estimates.
