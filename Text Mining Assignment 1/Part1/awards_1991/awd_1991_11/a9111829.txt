Abstract    :
              This project supports travel for thirty five US researchers to                 
              participate in the Eighth Congress of the International                        
              Federation for the Theory of Machines and Mechanisms to be held                
              in Prague, Czechoslovakia on August 28-31, 1991.  The thirty five              
              participants receiving support are to be selected from a list of               
              90 US participants.  Professors Seireg and Roth, of the                        
              University of Wisconsin and Stanford University respectively, are              
              distinguished researchers in this area, and will select the                    
              participants based on six criteria including stature in the                    
              field, potential contribution of the research, need for support,               
              and geographic distribution of US participants. This meeting is a              
              major event in the mechanisms field, and US involvement is                     
              absolutely necessary.  It is an excellent forum for technical                  
              exchange at the international level.  The selection criteria are               
              correct, and will insure a broad cross section representation of               
              US research in mechanisms and associated topics.
