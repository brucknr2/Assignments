Abstract    :
              A dynamic-angle spinning probe for solid-state nuclear                         
              magnetic resonance is acquired tosupport research in                           
              engineering.  The initial use of the probe will be the                         
              characterization of amorphous silia-alumina acid catalysts.                    
              Model catalysts with the acid function restricted to the                       
              surface are prepared and the density and strength of acid                      
              sites aremeasured by a conbination of base adosrption andacid-                 
              catalyzed reactions.  The activity of tehsilica-aluminas is                    
              correlated with the structure determined by dunamic-angle                      
              aluninum-27 nuclear magnetic resonance.                                        
              Acid catalysts are widely used industrially.  Because of their                 
              low cost, applications can be expected to increase in fuels                    
              refinement, chemicals production, and environmental control.                   
              However, a better understanding of their behavior is necessary                 
              to design control systems for optimum conversions.
