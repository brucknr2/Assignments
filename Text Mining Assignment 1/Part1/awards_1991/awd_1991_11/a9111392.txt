Abstract    :
              The study of the synthesis of a number of strained molecules,                  
              termed "fenestranes and/or fenestrenes" in this investigation                  
              will improve the understanding of the bonding character in such                
              compounds.  The synthesis and study of the 12 pi annulene                      
              (staurane-1,3,5,7,9,11-hexaene) and the 14 pi-?5.5.6.6.!                       
              fenestrane heptaene are important in terms of the bonding                      
              character of carbon.  In the approach  toward "planarization"                  
              of tetrahedral carbon, the targets have been chosen to provide                 
              a gradual increase in bond angle deformation/strain energy for                 
              purposes of comparision.  Initial research will focus on the                   
              synthesis of the ?5.5.5.5!fenestranes, (tccc) and (tctc), as                   
              well as ?5.5.6.6!fenestrenes.  Knowledge gained from synthesis                 
              of the above molecules will then be employed for the study of                  
              the more reactive ?5.5.5.5!fenestrenes.  In addition,                          
              investigation of the synthesis of fenestrane annulenes will                    
              help to determine if Huckel pi-delocalization plays a role in                  
              the stability of such polyquinene annulenes; these annulenes                   
              are primarily composed of fused five-membered rings.                           
              Calculations at various levels of sophistication for a variety                 
              of these fenestranes have provided accurate bond lengths and                   
              bond angles where comparison with X-ray structures is possible,                
              there are no experimental thermochemical data in strained                      
              systems for evaluation of the accuracy of the computational                    
              methods.  Studies of the chemistry/reactivity of the target                    
              molecules will provide much needed insight into the nature of                  
              the carbon chemical bond in organic molecules in general, and                  
              in particular with respect to carbon atoms where strain and                    
              angle deformation may effect a change in hybridization.                        
                                                                                             
              The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the continuation of                
              the studies of Dr. James M. Cook.  The research will provide                   
              greater understanding of the effect of strain upon the carbon                  
              framework by the construction of molecules which have highly                   
              distorted structures.  This has the potential to provide deeper                
              insight into how chemical reactivity can be usefully                           
              manipulated.
