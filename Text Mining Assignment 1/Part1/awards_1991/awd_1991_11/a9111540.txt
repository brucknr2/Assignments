Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research is proposed by an interdisciplinary group of researchers              
              at the University of Texas who will attempt breakthroughs in                   
              Computational Fluid Dynamics by exploiting advances in computer                
              architectures, algorithms, data structures and computing                       
              strategies in a unified and fully coordinated way so that each                 
              component of the overall computing process can be optimized.                   
              Advances are expected in adaptive algorithms, parallel                         
              computational models and parallel programming systems, parallel/               
              adaptive data structures, and new applications of these in CFD.
