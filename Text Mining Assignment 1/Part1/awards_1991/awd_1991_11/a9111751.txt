Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal the basis of the phenomenon whereby the chloroplast              
              ATPase can be activated either by light, or sulfite ions (but in               
              the dark).  This unusual effect counteracts (by-passes) inhibition             
              by tightly bound ADP, and allows construction of a chemical model              
              for the effects of membrance high-energy state on the ATPase.  The             
              effects of sulfite stimulation of uni-site catalysis in spinach                
              thylakoids vs. effect on steady state rates will be among the                  
              objects of this study.
