Abstract    :
              Computer simulation of electronic and optical                                  
              devices is facilitating the rapid advancement of                               
              knowledge in science and engineering.  The ability                             
              to model devices beforehand permits better use of                              
              limited resources and increase the assurance that                              
              devices which are fabricated will operate as desired.                          
              However, not all important devices are easily                                  
              simulated on existing device modelling programs.                               
              Computer simulation programs for high speed                                    
              InP/InGaAs p-i-n photodetectors are meager in                                  
              spite of the importance of these devices to optical                            
              fiber communications and to other scientific                                   
              applications.  A simulation program for high speed                             
              InP/InGaAs p-i-n photodetectors will be created                                
              using finite element methods.  The program will be                             
              designed to model the DC characteristics, initially,                           
              of these devices in any of the three spatial                                   
              dimensions and lay the groundwork for an                                       
              extension of the model to AC operation.  The                                   
              model will also permit the use of nontraditional                               
              materials in photodetector design.  The importance                             
              of the work will be enhancement of the ability to                              
              perform fast yet innovative research on these                                  
              devices.
