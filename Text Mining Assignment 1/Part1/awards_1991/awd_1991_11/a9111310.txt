Abstract    :
                   The purpose of the research is to study the feasibility of                
              nanocrystalline Nb3A1 formation by mechanically alloying                       
              elemental powders.  Nb3A1 intermetallic was chosen for its                     
              highest temperature capability among structural aluminides as                  
              well as for its high current density property as a                             
              superconductor.  The appeal of mechanical alloying for the                     
              synthesis of Nb3A1 intermetallics stems from its capability to                 
              make alloys with controlled microstructure via solid-state                     
              processing.  This is particularly important for Nb and A1 which                
              have large differences in melting points and densities thereby                 
              causing conventional melting techniques to be difficult,                       
              hazardous and less controllable.  In addition, mechanical                      
              alloying has the potential of obtaining very fine grain sizes,                 
              eventually in the nanometer  range that hold the promise for                   
              properties greatly exceeding those of conventionally processed                 
              intermetallic compounds.  The  main benefit of nanostructure                   
              processing -superplasticity- is more rewarding for intermetallics              
              that are usually known for their complete lack of ductility and                
              formability.  Consequently, the benefits of Nb3A1 as a very high               
              temperature resistant, relatively less dense and oxidation                     
              resistant material may be fully used in industrial and aerospace               
              applications.                                                                  
                   These alloys are extremely interesting in both                            
              superconducting and in aerospace/structural applications and                   
              could be widely used if their ductility could be improved.
