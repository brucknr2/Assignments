Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Midkiff will conduct research on genetic and experiential                  
              antecedents of salt preference.  Her experiments will examine the              
              effect of sodium deprivation during gestation and lactation, with              
              periodic sodium repletion, on the long-term salt preference of                 
              rats.  Two genetic strains of laboratory rats will be used:                    
              Fischer-344, which do not spontaneously prefer salt solutions in               
              any concentration, and outbred Wistar rats, which prefer and                   
              copiously ingest salt solutions at hypotonic and isotonic                      
              concentrations.  Rats from both strains reared on a sodium-                    
              deficient diet will be compared with control animals receiving                 
              the same diet with 1% salt added.  This study is designed to                   
              determine whether early experience with salt can alter salt                    
              preference in adulthood.  Previous studies have not found any                  
              long-term alteration in salt ingestion as a result of early                    
              experience, although two studies have described an alteration in               
              water ingestion.  Dr. Midkiff's preliminary studies indicate that              
              long-term salt preference may altered, at least in Wistar rats,                
              by post-weaning sodium deprivation and repletion.  Results from                
              this study will be used to direct further research into the                    
              limits of behavioral change based on early experience, and into                
              the genetic origins of salt preference.
