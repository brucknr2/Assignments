Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable                        
              Dr. Harvey Hensley of Northwestern University to conduct                       
              collaborative research with Dr. Takao Mizusaki at Kyoto                        
              University, Japan.  The team will apply Hensley's ultrasonic                   
              methods to study nuclear ordered solid helium-3.                               
                                                                                             
              Solid helium-3 has been of intense interest since the discovery                
              in 1974 that at temperatures below 1 millikelvin the nuclei in                 
              solid Helium-3 undergo a transition from a paramagnetic state to               
              a nuclear magnetically ordered state.  To date, primarily                      
              thermodynamic measurements and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)                
              techniques have been utilized to study the nature of this                      
              transition.  Mizusaki's expertise in preparing single crystals of              
              solid helium-3 and in studying them in their ordered state using               
              NMR experiments complements the acoustic methods Hensley has                   
              developed to study superfluid helium-3.  Utilizing the                         
              sophisticated cryogenic apparatus at Kyoto University, the team                
              will extend Hensley's acoustic methods from superfluid to solid                
              helium-3 and try to determine the structure of the low field                   
              phase of nuclear magnetically ordered solid helium-3.
