Abstract    :
              The PI has been conducting extensive research                                  
              supported by NSF in three major areas:  millimeter-                            
              wave remote sensing of geophysical media; bistatic                             
              scattering from rough surfaces; and modeling of                                
              forest canopy at the microwave region.  All three                              
              areas require studying interaction of waves with                               
              random or inhomogeneous natural media.  Major                                  
              objectives are the development of basic information                            
              on microwave and millimeter-wave remote sensing.                               
              Thus far efforts have been directed to extensive                               
              experimental and theoretical investigations.  Over the                         
              past 10 years, the PI has developed a mobile truck                             
              mounted radars at L, C, X, and millimeter-wave                                 
              frequency bands.  Experimental studies, however,                               
              have been limited by the speed and reliability of the                          
              data acquisition system and controllers.  The fast data                        
              acquisition system and computers provided in this                              
              NSF Engineering Research Equipment Grant should                                
              advance the ability to conduct experiments in situ and                         
              to develop theoretical models of wave interactions                             
              with geophysical media.
