Abstract    :
              This project will use a three-dimensional                                      
              motion measurement and analysis system to                                      
              determine and display gait patterns exhibited                                  
              by humans under normal daily activities.  The                                  
              equipment, which will be funded partially                                      
              through this grant, consists of four                                           
              subsystems: 1) a video image analysis system,                                  
              2) a data acquisition subsystem, 3) a                                          
              computer workstation, and 4) a force analysis                                  
              subsytem.  This equipment will enable an                                       
              experimental Biomechanics Laboratory to be                                     
              established in the department of Mechanical                                    
              Engineering.  Among the research projects                                      
              that will be performed are a study of the                                      
              influence of load carriage on the                                              
              biomechanics of walking gait, the design                                       
              analysis, construction, and evaluation of                                      
              polyaction knee orthoses, the response of                                      
              trunk muscles to static and dynamic physical                                   
              task performance, the influence of load and                                    
              the method of load carriage on the kinetics                                    
              and kinematics of stair ascent and descent,                                    
              and the locomotor characteristics of those                                     
              with degenerative joint disease.
