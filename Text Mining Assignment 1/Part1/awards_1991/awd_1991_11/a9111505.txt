Abstract    :
              This is a Research Equipment Grant                                             
              for a laboratory to do measurement                                             
              of fast voltage transients.  The                                               
              funds will be used to purchase an                                              
              opto-electronic voltage probe, an                                              
              optical transmission line, and                                                 
              ancillary equipment.  The equipment                                            
              will be of immediate benefit in two                                            
              projects: 1) Laboratory simulation                                             
              of lightning-induced voltages on                                               
              overhead power lines; and 2)                                                   
              Effects of non-standard voltage                                                
              waveshapes on impulse strengths of                                             
              dielectric systems.
