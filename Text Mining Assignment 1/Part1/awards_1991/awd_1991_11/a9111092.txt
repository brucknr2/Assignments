Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A fundamental problem in the neurosciences is the                              
              characterization of the mechanism(s) controlling the release of                
              neurotransmitters and neurohormones at nerve endings.  These                   
              mechanisms are crucial to nerve cell communication and to a                    
              healthy, functioning nervous system.  Although the importance of               
              calcium's role in release has been well established, details in                
              its action are poorly understood.  This research project is                    
              designed to examine, quantitatively, the relationship between                  
              calcium currents and intracellular calcium concentrations.                     
              Moreover, receptor mediated regulation of the calcium current and              
              its effect on intracellular calcium levels will be directly                    
              evaluated.  Electrophysiological techniques combined with                      
              microspectrofluorometry of calcium sensitive, fluorescent                      
              indicators will be used to monitor intracellular calcium levels.               
              Techniques will be developed to allow simultaneous monitoring of               
              neurohormone release from single endings.  This research will                  
              lead to a better understanding of the properties and actions of                
              molecular components regulating neurohormone release from                      
              vertebrate nerve endings.
