Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The effect of environmental variables on human performance is a                
              long-standing concern of physical anthropologists.  The primary                
              objective of this research is to analyze the biological and                    
              behavioral factors that affect the ability of humans to work in a              
              cold environment.  The proposed research will be carried out in                
              northern China as heavy laborers are paid by the unit of work                  
              accomplished, thus allowing easy quantification of work                        
              performance.  Additionally, the Director of the Work Physiology                
              Department of the Institute of Occupational Medicine is a co-PI                
              on this project.  The PIs will use standard and newly developed                
              methods to measure the workers and their productivity in the                   
              laboratory and under field conditions.                                         
                                                                                             
              The results will be used to test models of the factors which                   
              enhance and limit human performance under cold conditions.
