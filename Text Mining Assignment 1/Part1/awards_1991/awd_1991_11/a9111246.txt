Abstract    :
              This project addresses the Distributed Element Method (DEM) for                
              modeling dynamic systems.  It attempts to remedy difficulties                  
              associated with the classical methods of modal analysis and                    
              eigenfunction expansion.  The modal analysis technique models                  
              only a finite number of modes, whereas the eigenfunction                       
              expansion method has disadvantages in numerical simulations.  The              
              DEM method uses the transfer function concept, and is easily                   
              adapted for control problems.  It is particularly suitable for                 
              symbolic computation and allows direct evaluation of the dynamic               
              characteristics of complex systems including system spectrum and               
              mode shapes, response and stability.  Although vibration problems              
              will be stressed in this project, the methodology has potential                
              applications in other disciplines, including heat conduction and               
              diffusion.
