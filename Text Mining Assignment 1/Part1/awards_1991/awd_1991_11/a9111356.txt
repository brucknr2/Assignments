Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is aimed at a joint in-situ quartz crystal                       
              microbalance and spectroelectrochemical characterization of the                
              electropolymerization and doping of conducting polymers.  The goal             
              is to show feasibility for using these two techniques together with            
              ultraviolet-visible spectral measurements to show specral changes              
              that occur during known mass changes in the film under                         
              electrochemical control of the doping process.
