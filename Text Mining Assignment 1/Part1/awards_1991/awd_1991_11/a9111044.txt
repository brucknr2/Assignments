Abstract    :
              This proposal will investigate a general framework for signal                  
              recovery problems, combining set-theoretic and optimization                    
              techniques for use with incomplete measurement data and partial                
              constraints.  Computationally attractive algorithms and performance            
              bounds will be developed and assessed, with the results applied to             
              inverse problems of practical interest.
