Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project, under the direction of Dr. Kleinhaus, will              
              examine the effects of two neurotransmitter, serotonin and FMRF-               
              amide, on the intracellular calcium levels in identified nerve                 
              cells of an invertebrate model system.  There is evidence                      
              suggesting that these two neurotransmitters are involved in the                
              regulation of essential behaviors in the leech.  These                         
              neurotransmitters have been shown to alter the effects of calcium              
              and modulate the excitability of Retzius cells, multifuctional                 
              nerve cells that have been implicated in the control and                       
              integration of at least two behaviors, swimming and feeding, in                
              this animal.  A combination of optical and electrophysiological                
              techniques will be used to monitor the dynamics of calcium                     
              concentration in selective nerve cells to establish a                          
              relationship between membrane potential and internal calcium                   
              level.  This investigation will provide additional knowledge                   
              regarding the mechanism of action and effects of serotonin and                 
              FRMF-amide on the nervous system.
