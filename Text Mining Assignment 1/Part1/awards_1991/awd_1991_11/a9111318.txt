Abstract    :
              The aim of this research is to understand the flow mechanism of                
              microphase-separated block copolymers in the strong-segregation                
              limit (SSL).  Microphase-separated block copolymers are chemically             
              composite materials which play a prominant role in the formulation             
              of many advanced materials.  New material design requires an in-               
              depth understanding of the physics of the component materials and              
              of the interaction of their physics with processing.                           
                                                                                             
              The research focusses on three tasks:  First, they intend to                   
              observe directly the flow morphology of block copolymers in the SSL            
              using small-angle neutron scattering.  Second, they will do a                  
              comprehensive comparison between the rheological properties of                 
              samples with macroscopically ordered mesophases versus isotropic               
              materials.  Third, they will elucidate the impact of mesophase                 
              shape on linear-viscoelastic properties.  Since microphase-                    
              separated block copolymers are very much like well-mixed                       
              incompatible polymer blends, the experiments performed will also               
              bear on general questions in polymer thermodynamics, such as                   
              whether shearing a binary mixture can affect its phase diagram.
