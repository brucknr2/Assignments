Abstract    :
              In 1987, Dr. Rosemary G. Gillespie discovered a remarkable                     
              radiation of spiders in the genus Tetragnatha in the Hawaiian                  
              islands.  She is currently describing the structure, behavior, and             
              ecology of each of 50 previously-unknown and 8 known species found             
              nowhere else on earth.  Although Tetragnatha species are abundant              
              and widely distributed on earth, the Hawaiian spiders are more                 
              diverse than those known in the rest of the world combined.  The               
              ultimate goal of the work proposed here is to explain the                      
              mechanisms by which this diversity was generated.  Crucial to that             
              goal is the construction of an accurate pattern of relationships               
              (phylogeny) of the species.  Recently, the use of DNA sequences to             
              augment more traditional data used to determine relationships has              
              already sequenced a segment of DNA from some of these species.  The            
              work proposed here will expand that data set in order to delineate             
              the approaches which shall be taken in studying the mechanisms of              
              explosive diversification in this group.  The results of the final             
              work should have broad implications in the field of phylogenetics              
              and systematics at the species level, not only within ecologically-            
              diversifying species swarms in Hawaii, but in continental habitats             
              as well.
