Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the upgrade of instrumentation used in the                 
              research area of dynamics of solid state systems. Fundamental                  
              problems in dynamics and intermolecular interactions in solids are             
              currently studied.  Specifically, dynamics in low temperature                  
              glasses probed with time domain and frequency domain optical                   
              nonlinear experiments, the mechanism of superconductivity in the               
              new high temperature superconducting materials, and polariton                  
              dynamics in molecular single crystals at very low temperatures                 
              probed with transient grating experiments will be studied with the             
              proposed instrumentation.   The requested equipment includes a                 
              mode-locked YAG laser with frequency doubler and Q-switch, two dye             
              lasers, two Pockel cells, 4 doublers, 2 amplifiers for the dye                 
              lasers, associated hardware, optics, electronics and an optical                
              bench.
