Abstract    :
                   Research is directed toward the study of few level models                 
              in atomic radiation theory.  The ultimate aim is a basic                       
              understanding of wave mixing processes on a microscopic level.                 
              The modeling will include two-mode interactions and will                       
              employ higher-order RWA methods and Floquet techniques.  It is                 
              expected that experimental tests of our model calculations                     
              will be possible.
