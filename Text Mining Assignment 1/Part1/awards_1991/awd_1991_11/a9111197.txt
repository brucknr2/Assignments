Abstract    :
                   Understanding the atmospheric boundary layer and the effect               
              it has on cloud growth is a fundamental meteorological problem                 
              that is important to a broad range of atmospheric questions                    
              ranging from venting of pollutants to the free atmosphere to the               
              effect of cloud cover on climate.  Observations have clearly                   
              shown that clouds can form in distinctive and very organized                   
              patterns over expansive areas.                                                 
                   The Principal Investigator will continue his research on the              
              organization of mesoscale convection that evolves in time within               
              the planetary boundary layer as cold and dry continental air                   
              masses advect over relatively warmer bodies of open water.  The                
              Principal Investigator will use observational data collected from              
              a previously held field program along with theoretical studies                 
              and numerical models to ascertain important characteristics of                 
              the boundary layer over Lake Michigan.
