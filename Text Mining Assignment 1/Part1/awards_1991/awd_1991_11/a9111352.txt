Abstract    :
                   The primary goals of the large-scale research project are                 
              thus: 1) to obtain an unequivocal age of dolomitization; and 2) to             
              critically evaluate the source of dolomitizing fluid(s) and the                
              hydrologic driving mechanism(s) in order to develop a well                     
              constrained framework in which to interpret the present geochemical            
              data base.  The objectives of this planning grant are twofold and              
              reflect the need to address the feasibility of the large-scale                 
              goals prior to continuing with the project.  The first objective               
              of the preliminary research addresses if and exactly how Knox                  
              dolomites are related to other diagenetic minerals that yield                  
              radiometric and isotopic ages.  The feasibility of tieing in these             
              minerals with he established paragenesis of Knox dolomites in                  
              unmineralized areas will be tested.  The second goal of the                    
              planning grant is to determine the feasibility of using radiogenic             
              isotopes for direct age determination of minerals closely                      
              associated with the Knox burial dolomites.
