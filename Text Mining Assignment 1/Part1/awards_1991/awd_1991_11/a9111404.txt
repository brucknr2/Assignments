Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, PI's from three institutions will carry out                   
              sampling on a transect in the Southern Ocean along 65 degrees                  
              South latitude across the Ross Sea.  The sampling will be carried              
              out on the USSR vessel, R/V IOFFE.  Scientists from the Scripps                
              Institution of Oceanography will be responsible for the                        
              hydrography and nutrients, while scientists from Oregon State                  
              University will provide overall coordination and contribute to                 
              the data analysis.  The Lamont contribution (this project) will                
              be to acquire and analyze samples for the tracers, Tritium,                    
              Helium, Oxygen-18, and Carbon-14.  This section constitutes a                  
              joint contribution by the USA and the Soviet Union to the                      
              International World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE),                       
              specifically Hydrographic line S-4.
