Abstract    :
              The broad goals of this project are to gain a more precise                     
              understanding of the potential of parallel computation, to recognize           
              its limitations, and to design computers and algorithms with optimal           
              or near-optimal performance.  The following topics will be addressed:          
                                                                                             
              1.  The refinement of current models of parallel computation through           
                  the incorporation of additional technological parameters.                  
                                                                                             
              2.  The design of special-purpose sorting hardware.                            
                                                                                             
              3.  The feasibility of general purpose parallel computers based on             
                  sorting.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              4.  The design and analysis of fault-tolerant sorting circuits.
