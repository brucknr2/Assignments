Abstract    :
                Currently, users have difficulties in retrieving information                 
              which is stored in different types of database systems. Most users             
              are not familiar with different query languages and may not be                 
              aware of the locations of data. The objective of this project is to            
              facilitate query formulation and to speed up query processing in               
              heterogeneous database environments, i.e. where different types of             
              database systems, specifically, relational, object-oriented,                   
              deductive, and textual systems co-exist in an organization or                  
              across different organizations. To enable a user who is familiar               
              with only a single query language to access information stored in              
              different types of database systems, translators of query languages            
              are being built.  An intelligent data dictionary is constructed to             
              facilitate schema integration and query translation.  Query                    
              processing performance is optimized  by application of logic-based             
              methods, using knowledge about the types of queries previously                 
              processed. Parallel processing techniques across different systems             
              are employed to provide further speedup.  The resulting                        
              heterogeneous query processing system will find wide applicability             
              as the networking of different database systems becomes widespread.
