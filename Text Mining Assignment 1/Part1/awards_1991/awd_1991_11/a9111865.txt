Abstract    :
              This Science in Developing Countries award                                     
              will support a Workshop on Shorebird Ecology                                   
              and Conservation in the Western Hemisphere,                                    
              held in Quito, Ecuador, November 3-9, 1991.                                    
              The U.S. Reserve Network.  The workshop aims                                   
              to provide a regional forum for discussing                                     
              significant advances in knowledge of                                           
              shorebird migration, ecology, and                                              
              conservation.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The workshop will feature 5 invited speakers,                                  
              presentations by 10 Latin Americans whose                                      
              participation will be supported competitively                                  
              through this award, and a roundtable                                           
              discussion.  Shorebirds have been the subject                                  
              of intensive study and conservation.  Though                                   
              many researchers in North, Central, and South                                  
              America are involved in shorebird work, there                                  
              have been few opportunities for interaction                                    
              among them.  Thus, a major benefit of this                                     
              workshop, with its simultaneous English-                                       
              Spanish translation, will be the promotion of                                  
              maximum communication and exchange among                                       
              shorebird researchers in advancing the                                         
              knowledge base and providing the ground for                                    
              future research collaboration throughout the                                   
              Hemisphere.
