Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The object of this research is the analysis and                           
              interpretation of an atmospheric undular bore (solitary wave)                  
              using existing observations taken by doppler radar, rawinsondes,               
              satellites, conventional surface network of meteorological                     
              stations, and an instrumental tower (500 m).  Existing theory of               
              solitary waves will guide the analysis.
