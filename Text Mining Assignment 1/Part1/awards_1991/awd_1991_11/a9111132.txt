Abstract    :
              In distributed systems, certain control processes run concurrently             
              with application processes.  Examples include deadlock and termination         
              detectors, garbage collectors, and consistent global state                     
              coordinators.  These types of processes sometimes inhibit actions of           
              the application process; in other words, they disable a subset of              
              actions that the application would otherwise perform.  For example,            
              consistent global state coordinators sometimes prevent the sending of          
              application messages temporarily.  Such inhibition is often                    
              undesirable for a computation, particularly if performance is a                
              primary issue.                                                                 
              It has been formally demonstrated that inhibition can be necessary in          
              order to develop certain control algorithms, and that there are                
              sometimes tradeoffs between inhibition and increased message traffic.          
              In particular, this is the case for consistent global state                    
              coordinators.                                                                  
              This project investigates the role of inhibition in a broader range of         
              distributed control algorithms.  Potential targets include termination         
              and deadlock detection, garbage collection, and multicasting.  The             
              goal is to understand precisely when inhibition is necessary, how to           
              minimize inhibition, and how it affects other factors such as                  
              execution time, message complexity and fault tolerance.
