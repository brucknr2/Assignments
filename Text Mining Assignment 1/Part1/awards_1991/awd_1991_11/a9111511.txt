Abstract    :
                   The Forty-Fourth Annual Gaseous Electronics Conference, to                
              be held at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, on                     
              October 22-25, 1991, provides a forum for investigators of the                 
              basic physics and chemistry of ionized gases and macroscopic gas               
              discharge phenomena.  It plays a significant role in interfacing               
              basic science with related applications, emphasizing collisional,              
              radiative and plasma processes that occur in electric discharges,              
              arcs and gas lasers.  The grant supports participant costs                     
              (notably for graduate students), publication and administration                
              expenses.
