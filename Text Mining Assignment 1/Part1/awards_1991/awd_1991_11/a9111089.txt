Abstract    :
              This research addresses the design, fabrication, and                           
              characterization of vacuum microelectronic devices                             
              (diodes and triodes) using silicon shallow p-n                                 
              junction cold cathode arrays  This will be                                     
              accomplished using an ultra shallow p-n junction                               
              biased in the avalanche region as a cold cathode,                              
              and a built-on-chip polysilicon cantilever beam as                             
              an anode (for a diode) of a grid (for a triode).  A                            
              self-alignment technique will be tried to improve                              
              emission current density and uniformity.  The grid                             
              will be at a distance of 1-2 microns above the                                 
              cathode.  These devices will be arrayed to increase                            
              the magnitude of total emission current.  The                                  
              fabrication technology used will be fully compatible                           
              with IC technology, and operation at low voltages                              
              should be achieved.  Potential applications include                            
              flat panel displays, fast switching devices, and as an                         
              electron source for scientific instrumentation.
