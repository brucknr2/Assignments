Abstract    :
                   The knowhow of designing efficient algorithms meets the                   
              definition of a technology.  This proposal is about various aspects of         
              a parallel algorithmic technology.                                             
                   Given two parallel algorithms for the same problem one is more            
              efficient than the other if: (1) primarily, its time-processor product         
              is smaller, and (2) secondarily (but important), its parallel time is          
              smaller.  It is a primary intellectual challenge to get the fastest            
              possible time, by a processor-efficient algorithm.                             
                   The proposed work identifies several considerable challenges on           
              which to work in the next few years.  Contributions to major                   
              application domains ("Grand Challenges"), such as computer vision and          
              comparison of molecular sequences, and deadline-driven computing, as           
              well as to the fundamentals of the evolving technology of parallel             
              algorithms are expected.
