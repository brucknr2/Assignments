Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              The ultimate goal of the project is to investigate the                         
              relationship between phonology and phonetics for the feature                   
              Voice and other laryngeal features, through a detailed                         
              phonological and phonetic study of several languages.  The                     
              purpose of the planning grant is two-fold.  It will support                    
              background work on the phonetics and phonology of voicing,                     
              increased familiarity with the literature, exploration of                      
              possible phonetic methodologies, and consultation with expert                  
              researchers.  The second aspect of the plan is to conduct                      
              preliminary research on three topics concerning different aspects              
              of voicing and related features.  These include a study of                     
              sonorant voicing and devoicing in English, a cross-linguistic                  
              study of the status of "voiceless" nasals, and fieldwork and                   
              phonetic investigation of Madurese, an Austronesian language                   
              spoken in Indonesia.  The completion of these planning activities              
              and preliminary studies will enable the Principal Investigator to              
              address broader questions related to phonetic and phonological                 
              issues of voicing with the purpose of developing a more                        
              comprehensive research proposal on the subject.
