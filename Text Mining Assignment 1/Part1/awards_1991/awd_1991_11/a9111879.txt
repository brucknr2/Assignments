Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project tests the sensitivity of a new litter bag technique               
              in a comparative study of belowground root dynamics in mid-                    
              Atlantic and southern Spartina alterniflora salt marshes. The                  
              method provides precise and simultaneous measurements of root                  
              production and decomposition over short growth periods (1-2                    
              years); the procedure may be useful in long-term studies (3 or                 
              more years) of root dynamics and marsh accretion and                           
              decomposition. This research will be conducted in marshes at the               
              Virginia Coastal Reserve and North Inlet LTER sites.  Data                     
              obtained using the simultaneous root production and decomposition              
              technique will be compared with other production/decomposition                 
              methods already being used at these two sites.
