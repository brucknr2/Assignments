Abstract    :
              The layered approach to system design has become popular in                    
              designing correct systems because of the ease of visualizing the               
              execution as a sequence of processes each resulting from the                   
              execution of a layer.  This research aims at a lighter-weight                  
              approach compared to sequentialization of processes.  It defines               
              a notion of communication speed as it is relevant to distributed               
              systems, and a hierarchy of communication speeds as an alternative             
              to sequentialization of processes.  It also defines some                       
              synchronization abstractions that combine the concept of hierarchy             
              of communication speeds and some channel primitives.  These                    
              abstractions result in the same ease as sequentialization of                   
              processes and are expected to improve the system efficiency in a               
              layered system.  They are also useful for designing concurrent                 
              programs.  This research has several objective. 1) Develop a                   
              framework of thinking based on speeds of communication.  2) Develop            
              some implementations of these abstractions. 3) Develop a scheme for            
              decentralized control using hierarchical channel Primitives.  4)               
              Implement a distributed operating system using hierarchical channel            
              primitives and evaluate its performance.  5) Develope concurrent               
              algorithms that use and a concurrent programming environment that              
              supports hierarchical channel primitives.
