Abstract    :
              This is an ROW/Planning Grant.  In many problem areas, such as                 
              robotics, planning must occur in a dynamic and unpredictable                   
              environment.  As in any reasoning process, the act of planning                 
              takes time to complete - the more time that is spent in planning,              
              the less time that is available to enact the final solution.                   
              Thus when planning in a real-time environment we must consider                 
              the time required not only to enact the plan, but also to form                 
              the plan.  A real-time planning system then must be able to                    
              recognize the fact that its reasoning takes time, and the during               
              this time, changes in the world can occur (which may affect its                
              reasoning).  Most of the work that has been done in formalizing                
              commonsense reasoning and in planning has left this issue                      
              unaddressed.  The objective of this research is to understand the              
              role that time plays in planning and to design a formal model of               
              planning that incorporates time.  We propose to extend step-                   
              logic to address these real-time planning issues.  Step-logic is               
              a formal mechanism for modeling the ongoing process of reasoning.              
              Unlike traditional logical formalism, step-logic does not                      
              calculate a final set of conclusions which can be drawn from an                
              initial set of facts, but rather monitors the ever-changing set                
              of conclusions as time goes on.//
