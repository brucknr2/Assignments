Abstract    :
              This project's intent is the procurement of equipment to support               
              process control research at the University of Utah.                            
              Specifically, an MSC 1000 Parallel Processing Computer will be                 
              purchased and dedicated to initiating and developing a series of               
              innovative computer-man interface research projects in process                 
              control.  Initial research will focus on enhanced process control              
              of a nuclear reactor system.
