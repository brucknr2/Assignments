Abstract    :
                   This award provides support for a US-USSR workshop, to be held            
              at Rutgers University, on nonlinear science; more specifically,                
              geophysical wave-and-vortex systems, their nonlinear dynamics, data            
              assimilation, and predictability.  This workshop would bring                   
              together a number of the strongest scientists in nonlinear science             
              in the United States and Russia.  United States and Russian                    
              scientists lead the world in research on nonlinear science.                    
                   The study of nonlinear phenomena is a significant direction in            
              modern science.  Progress in the understanding of such fundamental             
              nonlinear phenomena such as solitons, coherent structures and their            
              defects, collapses, dissipative and hamiltonian chaos and                      
              turbulence is crucially important for many fields of physics,                  
              mechanics, chemical kinetics, and some fields of biology,                      
              geophysical sciences and the mathematical sciences.
