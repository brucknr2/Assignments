Abstract    :
                   Professor Jones will study examples of subfactors (both from              
              finite dimensional and infinite dimensional methods).  His                     
              techniques will involve the use of loop group representations, knot            
              theory, and statistical mechanics.  Of special importance is an                
              attempt to understand the correspondence between statistical                   
              mechanics and knot theory.  This will be approached both by looking            
              at large knots and a procedure called Baxterization.                           
                   Jones' work has its basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert            
              space operators.  These are families of linear functions on a                  
              certain type of infinite dimensional space.  He is interested in               
              how nests of these algebras fit inside one another.  This seemingly            
              technical subject turns out to have very important implications for            
              a large variety of other areas of mathematics and physics including            
              knot theory and the theory of three dimensional manifolds                      
              (topology) and statistical mechanics (physics).
