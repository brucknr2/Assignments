Abstract    :
              This project will produce contract designs for the mid-life                    
              refits of three NSF-owned research vessels - the R/Vs ENDEAVOR,                
              OCEANUS and WECOMA operated by the University of Rhode Island,                 
              the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Oregon State                      
              University, respectively.  These R/Vs are 15 years old and need                
              mid-life modifications to prevent science mission obsolescence                 
              and to rejuvenate their material condition.  This is Phase II of               
              a 3-phase program.  Phase I produced a preliminary design for                  
              improvements to be accomplished in varying degrees on each ship.               
              Phase II will produce bid-ready contract designs for each ship                 
              and Phase III proposals, one for each ship, will be for the                    
              actual mid-life refits staggered over three years.                             
                                                                                             
              A management team with representatives from the ship operations                
              and science staffs of each institution will oversee Phase II                   
              activities, and the firm of Rodney E. Lay & Associates will                    
              provide naval architecture and engineering services.
