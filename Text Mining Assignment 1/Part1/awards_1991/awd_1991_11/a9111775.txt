Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research employs the atomically flat grain-boundary facets                
              which form as the result of solute segregation in bismuth-doped                
              copper as a model system with which to study the relationship                  
              between grain boundary composition and structure and the evolution             
              of structure in a two component alloy.  The principal experimental             
              tools are conventional and high-resolution transmission electron               
              microscopy (HREM).  The approach is to identify crystallographic               
              orientations of the facet planes in each of two abutting grains for            
              a grain pair of specific misorientation, and then determine the                
              location of the bismuth atoms in the facets by HREM.  These results            
              are compared to atomistic calculations.  Evolution of facet types              
              is examined as a function of time and annealing temperature.

              This research provides important information about the atomic-scale            
              structure and chemistry of segregation at grain boundaries.  Grain             
              boundaries play an important role in determining the physical                  
              properties of polycrystalline materials.
