Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The geological discovery of remarkable hot-water plumes, the                   
              hydrothermal vents, in the sea floor along oceanic ridges, has                 
              been accompanied by remarkable biological discoveries about the                
              life forms surrounding those vents.  In certain locations in the               
              Atlantic, swarms of a new kind of shrimp have been found that                  
              lack normal eyes, and were presumed blind, but have a reflective               
              patch which may be a novel kind of eye.  These shrimp seem to be               
              the most active large invertebrates known to live on the deep                  
              seafloor, and live where the only illumination may be the dim                  
              far-red to infra-red from the extremely hot (350 deg C) water                  
              jets from the vents.  This study, part of a U.S./French                        
              collaboration using deep-sea submersibles, will see whether the                
              eyelike patch may be a specially evolved visual organ that allows              
              them to stay near to the vents where they feed, but avoid the                  
              lethal temperature of the vent itself, in an environment far too               
              dim for normal vision.  Techniques to be used will include                     
              microscopy on the fine structure of the patch and its connections              
              to the brain; biochemistry on possible pigment or                              
              neurotransmitter molecules; and electrophysiolgy on the light                  
              sensitivity.  Results from this novel study will have impact on                
              both visual neuroscience and biological oceanography, and                      
              possibly will define a new form of vision.
