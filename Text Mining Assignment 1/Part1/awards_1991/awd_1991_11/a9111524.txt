Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Defensive behavior is controlled by physical and chemical events               
              within the central nervous system. These events are influenced by              
              environmental, hormonal and genetic factors. Dr. Caroline                      
              Blanchard is a expert on the behavioral aspects of defense. This               
              Career Advancement Award is made for the purpose of advanced                   
              training in new techniques so that Dr. Blanchard can enhance her               
              skills in the areas of the neuroanatomical and neurochemical                   
              bases of defensive behavior. The technique of receptor binding                 
              autoradiography will be used to demonstrate where in the brain                 
              specific chemicals are active and what factors can change the                  
              binding patterns. The technique of direct chemical stimulation                 
              will be used to explore which brain sites and which chemical                   
              transmitter signals are important in influencing specific                      
              behaviors. Neuroendocrinological techniques will focus on the                  
              role of brain hormones. By studying connections among different                
              neural groups, the circuits involved in behavior can be                        
              determined. Part of this award involves collaborative research                 
              with a group of Russian neuroscientists who are interested in                  
              genetic aspects of behavioral defense systems. Knowledge gained                
              from these studies will lead to an increased understanding of the              
              neural mechanisms of defense.
