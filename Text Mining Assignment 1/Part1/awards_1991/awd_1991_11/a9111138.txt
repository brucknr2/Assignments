Abstract    :
              This is a planning grant in the research application program.                  
              Motivated by the need of modeling complex robotic environments,                
              this project will explore new methods on object                                
              modeling/representation.  Current modeling systems are limited to              
              representing only the geometrical information of isolated                      
              objects, which is far less than sufficient.  To be more effective              
              and informative, a modeling system should also describe the                    
              changeable aspect of an object, i.e., the object states, the                   
              functionalities of an object, and the interrelations among                     
              objects.  It seems, thus, reasonable to propose that modeling                  
              should be dynamic and sensor-related.                                          
                 The preliminary research and planning activities will focus on              
              surveying the ground for, and identifying problems of dynamic                  
              modeling, which aims to make manipulating and reasoning about                  
              sensory information an integrated part of modeling, taking into                
              account uncertainties.  The objective is to gain sufficient                    
              insight about the subject in order to conduct more substantial                 
              research.
