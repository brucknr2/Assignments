Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Neurotransmitters are chemicals that convey information to nerve               
              cells by binding to specific receptors on the cell membrane.                   
              Antisense DNA (asDNA), a small number of nucleotides                           
              complementary to the protein coding strand of DNA, may inhibit                 
              the in vivo production of neurotransmitter receptor subtypes that              
              cannot otherwise be selectively manipulated.  In contrast to the               
              development of receptor specific drugs, the asDNAs can be                      
              logically designed and quickly synthesized.  The aim of this                   
              project, under the direction of Dr. MacLennan, is to test whether              
              asDNAs select for specific neurotransmitters in brain.  A series               
              of experiments, using central dopamine receptor systems, will be               
              designed to determine if asDNA can manipulate neurotransmitter in              
              vivo.  By utilizing this technology, it may be possible to                     
              eliminate in selected areas of the brain, the effect of any given              
              neurotransmitter.  If effective, this tool will help determine                 
              the regulation and individual functions of receptor subtypes and               
              other important neuronal proteins, greatly advancing the study of              
              neurotransmitter receptors.
