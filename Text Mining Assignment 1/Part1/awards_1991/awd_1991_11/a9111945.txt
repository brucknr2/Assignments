Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with Lie algebras and vertex                    
              operator algebras.  The principal investigators plan to find                   
              relations between the classical and Lie theoretic proofs of the                
              Rogers-Ramanujan identities by studying vertex operator algebras               
              from the viewpoint of monodromy and Virasoro algebra theory.  In               
              addition, they will study Monstrous Moonshine and look for                     
              structure theorems on Lie algebras of prime characteristic which               
              will simplify the proof of the classification theorem.                         
                   The research supported concerns the representation theory of              
              Lie algebras and is focused on both the structure of these algebras            
              and the applications of these algebras to questions in theoretical             
              physics.  Beginning with works of Lie, Killing, and Cartan, the                
              theory of finite-dimensional Lie algebras has been developed for               
              the past 100 years and provides a necessary background for every               
              mathematician and physicist.
