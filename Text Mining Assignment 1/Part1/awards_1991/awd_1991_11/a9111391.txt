Abstract    :
              A new data system is requested for a JEOL HX110HF double-focusing              
              mass spectrometer, which is the only mass spectrometer in the                  
              Chemistry Department at N.C. State University.  During the 1989-               
              1990 fiscal year, 1096 samples were analyzed in 2045 hours with                
              this instrument.  Approximately another 2000 hours were required to            
              process and print the mass spectra, archive data files to magnetic             
              tape, and restore data files to the disk drive for further data                
              processing.  During the last year, this instrument was equipped                
              with a continuous-flow fast atom bombardment (FAB) interface and               
              microbore HPLC system for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry              
              (LC/MS).  In addition to the continued use of this mass                        
              spectrometer for routine service and research analyses of all                  
              types, LC/MS will be used by six major research groups and four                
              minor users in seven departments within the University.  Our                   
              experience over the last year has demonstrated that the slow data              
              processing speed of the existing system limits the instrument and              
              operator time available for data acquisition.  Because 5 sec.                  
              computer reset time is required between scans, LC/MS                           
              chromatographic resolution is severely limited.  The new data                  
              system will increase the sample throughput and productivity of the             
              laboratory and permit the full performance of the LC/MS system to              
              be realized.
