Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  School-aged children live important parts of their lives                  
              outside the home.  Parents play a critical role in structuring and             
              monitoring their children's activities outside the home, yet there             
              has been little examination of this role.  This research planning              
              project will to develop a plan to examine parents' actions in                  
              choosing, supervising and intervening in children's organized                  
              leisure activities outside of the home in order to increase our                
              understanding of the socialization process and broaden our view of             
              family life.  The goals of the planning period for this project are            
              the selection of research sites, pre-testing of interviews and                 
              observations of families and of adults involved in children's                  
              activities, the development of strategies for videotaping families             
              in their homes, and preparation for the fixed-response survey                  
              questionnaire.                                                                 
                                                                                             
                   This research planning project sets the stage for research                
              that will provide valuable information about the way in which                  
              parents bring their social resources to bear in assisting their                
              children's performance.  This project also provides an excellent               
              opportunity for a promising young scholar to carefully lay the                 
              groundwork for her future line of research.
