Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research planning effort is to develop              
              an integrated research program to facilitate process and product               
              development.  The effort will focus on the development of a                    
              Statistical Process Control (SPC) decision support system for                  
              process improvement.  The system will contain knowledge and                    
              expertise in SPC and neural network process modeling methods.                  
                   Industry interaction will be fostered through the                         
              participation of forest products industries.  The long term goal               
              is to develop and implement engineering techniques to improve                  
              forest products manufacturing and the extension of these techniques            
              to other non-traditional manufacturing areas.
