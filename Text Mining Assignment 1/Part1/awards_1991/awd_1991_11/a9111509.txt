Abstract    :
                   The dayside magnetopause and magnetosheath are important                  
              regions to study in order to gain a better understanding of how                
              solar wind plasma couples to our geospace environment.  This                   
              grant is to continue a theoretical and simulation study of plasma              
              processes associated with this region and their coupling to the                
              polar ionosphere.  The project includes studying 1) the formation              
              mechanism of slowmode shocks in the dayside magnetosheat, 2) the               
              responses of the bow shock and dayside dynamic pressure pulses,                
              3) three-dimensional impulsive plasma penetration, and 4) the                  
              heating mechanism and nonlinear particle dynamics associated with              
              slow shocks.
