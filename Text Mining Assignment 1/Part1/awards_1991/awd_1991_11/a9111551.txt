Abstract    :
              Dr. Provine is investigating the origins, development, and                     
              influence of the neutral theory of molecular evolution in relation             
              to modern evolutionary biology.  The neutral theory states that the            
              vast majority of changes at the molecular level in natural                     
              populations are caused by random fixation, through random sampling             
              drift, of selectively neutral or nearly neutral mutations.  This               
              is a strikingly new theory unrelated to earlier theories of                    
              selectively neutral evolution except in certain formal aspects, and            
              has stimulated more than two decades of intense controversy among              
              evolutionary biologists.  Dr. Provine is using the                             
              selectionist/neurtralist debate as a window through which to view              
              the complex interactions of the new molecular biology with                     
              evolutionary biology of the 1970s and 1980s.  He is examining this             
              debate through an historical and cultural perspective.
