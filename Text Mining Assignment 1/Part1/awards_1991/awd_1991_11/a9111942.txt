Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out in                       
              medium energy hadronic and electromagnetic nuclear physics.                    
              Polarization studies relating to properties of the nucleon and                 
              of few body systems will be carried out at the SATURNE                         
              facility (Saclay, France), at the MIT/Bates electron linac,                    
              and at CEBAF.  New and much more precise data on the charge                    
              structure of the proton will be obtained at Bates and in the                   
              future at CEBAF.  At Saclay, data will be obtained on                          
              polarization variables leading to improved understanding of                    
              the deuteron, and will also provide important polarimeter                      
              calibration data essential for the CEBAF and MIT/Bates core                    
              research programs.  Experiment planning and detector                           
              development work will be carried out relating to these and                     
              other approved activities at Bates and at CEBAF.  Simulations,                 
              data analysis, interpretation, and other related activities                    
              will be carried out at William & Mary.
