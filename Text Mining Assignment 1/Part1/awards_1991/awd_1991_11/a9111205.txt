Abstract    :
              Streptomyces scabies is a gram positive soil bacterium that is the             
              causative organism for scab disease on a variety of underground                
              vegetables.  The scab lesion that forms at the site of infection               
              is composed of a proliferation of suberinized material by the                  
              plant.  The mechanism by which the organism elicits the formation              
              of the typical scab lesion on the tuber is not well understood, but            
              may involve the production of compounds such as thaxtomin by the               
              pathogen.  The goal of this proposal is to begin to study the                  
              regulation of expression of plant genes, in response to the                    
              infection process.  In order to identify these plant regulated                 
              genes, a cDNA library will be prepared from tissue with developing             
              scab lesions.  Differential hybridization of the library with cDNAs            
              prepared from non-scab plant tissue versus cDNAs prepared from scab            
              tissue will be used to identify genes expressed specifically during            
              lesion formation.  Future work will be focused on studying the                 
              regulation of the genes and on the identification of the gene                  
              products that are made in response to infection.
