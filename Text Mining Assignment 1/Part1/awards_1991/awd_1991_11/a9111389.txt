Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory is a national                    
              facility which provides high magnetic fields to scientists and                 
              engineers conducting research in materials science and engineering,            
              physics and condensed matter science, biological science, and                  
              chemistry.  This four-year award provides support for operation of             
              the user facility, and support for magnet technology development               
              which includes building a 40 tesla hybrid magnet.
