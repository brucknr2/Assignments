Abstract    :
              The world-wide market for methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE,                       
              an octane enhancer) is projected to reach 26 billion                           
              pounds per year during the 1990's.  A recent ARCO study                        
              concludes that ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) is a more                         
              desirable fuel additive than MBTE.  Conventional                               
              technology requires distillation of fermentation ethanol                       
              prior to the synthesis of ETBE.  One focus of this                             
              proposal is the acid-catalyzed synthesis of ETBE in near-                      
              or supercritical water, thereby avoiding costly                                
              distillation.  Because ETBE is insoluble in water,                             
              separation of ETBE from the aqueous phase exiting the                          
              reactor is facile.  A second focus of this proposal is the                     
              acid-catalyzed synthesis of a mixture of ethyl butyl                           
              ethers (EBE) in near- or supercritical water from                              
              fermentation products ethanol and 1-butanol.  Mixed EBE's                      
              should have fuel properties similar the ETBE, and would be                     
              a fully renewable high octane fuel additive.                                   
                                                                                             
              The proposed research emphasizes kinetic studies of the                        
              acid-catalyzed mechanism of ether formation in near- and                       
              supercritical water using two plug flow reactors.  Kinetic                     
              models developed during this work will be useful for                           
              reactor design and scale-up.  This research will also help                     
              to clarify the extent to which kinetics can be used to                         
              detail mechanism.
