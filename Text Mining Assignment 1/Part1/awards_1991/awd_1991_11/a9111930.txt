Abstract    :
                 Professor James Lisy is supported by a grant from the                       
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for studies of large                   
              clusters of alkali ions with ten or more molecules of                          
              solvation.  A study of the competitive binding of ions to water                
              versus other solvents, the use of vibrational spectroscopy to                  
              investigate the structures of products of intracluster ion                     
              chemistry, and the study of solvent shell structures around                    
              halide anions, will be accompanied by Monte Carlo and molecular                
              dynamics calculations.                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              The interaction between ions and neutral molecules is of                       
              fundamental importance to the understanding of condensed phase                 
              chemistry, ion transport in biological systems and atmospheric                 
              chemistry.  These experimental and theoretical studies on                      
              isolated clusters, consisting of an ion and ten or more solvent                
              molecules, are expected to provide the information that is                     
              necessary to formulate our understanding of the nature of the                  
              interactions of ions with the surrounding molecules.
