Abstract    :
                   Detecting a change in the type of relationship modelled in                
              regression form is accompanied by the need for inference about                 
              the point at which the change occurs.  This research will examine              
              statistical tests and their properties and will construct                      
              confidence regions for change points, concentrating on two-phase               
              multiple regression.  Approximate distributions for test                       
              statistics will be generated, power functions will be estimated,               
              robustness will be considered theoretically and numerically, and               
              an alternative estimator will be defined using a neural network                
              algorithm.
