Abstract    :
              9442825  Cheng  This REU supplemental award No. CCR-9111563 enables two 
              undergraduate students to participate in the research on the  formal analysis,
              verification, synthesis, and execution of  realtime rule-based expert systems. 
              The projects to be  performed by these students include the design and 
              implementation of several modules for the analysis of rule-  based systems
              written in different expert system shells and  the synthesis of real-time
              rule-based systems with bounded  response time.  The students also gain
              hands-on experience  in the development of an efficient and fault-tolerant 
              execution environment for real-time rule-based systems.  Students under this
              program have access to state-of-theart  computing facilities and to industrial
              real-time rule-based  systems.  This award recognizes the importance of
              hands-on  experience in active research for attracting and training 
              undergraduates, in particular, women and minorities, for  careers in
              mathematics, science and engineering, and that  too few such experiences are
              now available at large, urban,  public universities.  ***
