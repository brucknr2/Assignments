Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The successful functioning of market based economies depends in                
              large measure on the existence of widespread public understanding              
              of the operation of market mechanisms and belief in the fairness,              
              efficiency and effectiveness of markets.  Given the existence of               
              centrally planned economies throughout Eastern Europe for most of              
              the post World War II era, there are real questions about the                  
              nature and extent of public understanding and appreciation of                  
              market mechanisms anywhere in Eastern Europe.  These questions                 
              raise serious concerns about the ability of the emerging                       
              democracies of Eastern Europe to make successful transitions from              
              centrally planned to market economies.                                         
                                                                                             
              This project undertakes exploratory research in Eastern Europe                 
              designed both to describe and explain existing economic attitudes              
              and beliefs of citizens in the centrally planned economies and to              
              provide baseline data that will permit more dynamic assessments of             
              the relationships between economic attitudes and beliefs and                   
              economic structures as Eastern European nations attempt the                    
              difficult transition from centrally planned to market economies.               
                                                                                             
              The significance of this research lies not only in what it will                
              tell us about the prospects for developing market economies in the             
              several formerly communist nations of Eastern Europe but also in               
              what it will help us learn more broadly about the interplay of                 
              economic structures, their functions, and the nature of public                 
              economic thinking.
