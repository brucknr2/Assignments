Abstract    :
              This research is to continue prior NSF supported research to address           
              various technical problems that impede progress toward software reuse.         
              A comprehensive approach to reuse has been developed, which permits            
              people to write formal specifications of reusable components, to               
              certify their correctness using both verification and testing, and to          
              build particularly efficient implementations for them.  The overall            
              objective of this project is to demonstrate the practicality of a new          
              generation of formally specified, certified, and efficient reusable            
              software components.  Specifically, the researchers intend to design           
              understandable formal specifications for a representative sample of            
              general-purpose reusable software components; to show how to use these         
              specifications to verify and to test the correctness of both                   
              implementations of these modules and their clients; and to apply               
              several novel data structures and algorithms to build efficient                
              implementations of these components.  Successful completion of the             
              project will include among its results (1) a catalog of formal                 
              specifications of reusable software components having certifiably              
              correct and efficient implementations, and (2) a "handbook of design"          
              containing explicit guidelines for developing other reusable                   
              components in a similar way.
