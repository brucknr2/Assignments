Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There are two priceless neuroanatomical collections of a                       
              range of mammalian brains, representing more than 120 species and              
              all the major groups of mammals, including some now rare or                    
              endangered species.  This project is the first step in making an               
              electronically available catalog of all this material on video                 
              discs.  Tests will be used to decide which is the best means of                
              producing and storing quality images of the thousands of prepared              
              tissue slides, with adequate visual resolution for anatomical                  
              work.  The potential impact of a new accessibility of this                     
              irreplaceable tissue for research and teaching is enormous,                    
              providing excellent anatomical information on rare or endangered               
              species already preserved without sacrificing any more specimens,              
              wide distribution of data to any interested researcher, and                    
              illustrations for instructional programs.  This work also may                  
              provide a model for helping other collections move into                        
              electronically accessible formats.
