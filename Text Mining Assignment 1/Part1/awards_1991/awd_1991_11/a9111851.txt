              The objective of this conference is to provide a forum for                     
              food engineers in academia and industry to discuss present                     
              developments and future directions, exchange ideas and                         
              experiences, demonstrate gaps, and recognize challenges.                       
              The key features of this conference are: plenary lectures,
