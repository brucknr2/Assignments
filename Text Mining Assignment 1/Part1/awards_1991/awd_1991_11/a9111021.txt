Abstract    :
              The proposed research program will investigate the effect                      
              of temperature distributions on the flexural behavior of                       
              frozen soil to have better handle on designing frozen soil                     
              retaining walls. Artificial ground freezing in a weak soil                     
              and high water table conditions present economical means of                    
              for retaining earth pressures. Through an                                      
              analytical/experimental reseasrch scheme frozen soil beams                     
              with non-uniform temperature distibution will be analyzed,                     
              and a finite element computer code will be developed to                        
              accomodate temperature effects.
