Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal explores transport phenomena and dynamics of                     
              solidification in mushy zones of metal alloys.  The approach                   
              employs both modelling and experimentation on the flow of                      
              interdendritic liquid through solid networks.  Emphasized are high             
              liquid fractions greater than 0.65% by volume and the associated               
              convective flow.  The goals are to determine permeability and                  
              correlate it with a microstructural length scale and the volume                
              fraction liquid.  Permeability for columnar and equiaxed structures            
              are determined by simulating tortuous flow through actual dendritic            
              networks that are documented by image analysis of the cast                     
              structures.  The modelling makes use of finite element modelling               
              codes.

              This research provides an approach to obtaining permeability values            
              needed for the modelling of dendritic solidification processes.                
              Modelling is important for understanding solidification processes              
              and minimizing macrosegregation in castings.
