Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  There are numerous basic plasma processes which are of                    
              fundamental importance in solar-terrestrial physics.  Among                    
              these, the expansion of the solar wind in solar corona is an                   
              outstanding example which has attracted a great deal of                        
              theoretical interest during the past many years.  In the last                  
              several decades, many researchers have made important and                      
              valuable contributions to the understanding of this process.  In               
              this research, there are several relevant problems which will be               
              addressed.                                                                     
                                                                                             
                   Since the first theoretical model of coronal expansion                    
              proposed by Parker (1958), there have been many discussions                    
              (e.g., Whang and Chang, 1965; Hartle and Sturrock, 1968; Nishida,              
              1969; Hozer and Axford, 1970; Geiss et al., 1970; Lemaire and                  
              Schere, 1971; Leer and Axford, 1972; Lemaire and Scherer, 1971)                
              utilized on a kinetic approach.  All other discussions are based               
              on hydrodynamic theory, whether one-fluid theory or two-fluid                  
              theory was used.  Furthermore, most of them have imposed the                   
              assumption of thermal isotropy which seems to be justifiable by                
              observational results but is actually not.  Of course, there are               
              other publications in the literature in which both kinetic models              
              and effects of thermal anisotropy have been considered, but these              
              discussions may not emphasize the coronal region.                              
                                                                                             
                   This work builds on the view of Fichtner and Fahr (1990)                  
              who remarked that their results can be important for the                       
              discussion of waves, because thermal anisotropy can result in a                
              variety of instabilities which should in turn lead to significant              
              consequences.  It is in this context that the studies should                   
              complement the existing theories.  This study does not directly                
              address the coronal expansion.  Rather, it will pay special                    
              attention to the effects of plasma turbulence on the dynamic                   
              process.
