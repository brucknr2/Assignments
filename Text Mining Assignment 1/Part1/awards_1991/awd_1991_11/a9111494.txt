Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the anomaly exhibited in the                     
              vibrational motion of copper atoms in high Tc superconductors that             
              has been detected near the onset of the superconductivity.  At                 
              present it is not known whether this anomaly is associated with the            
              superconductive state.  The experiments will use blocking of beta              
              particles emitted from neutron activated Cu-64 nuclei in a                     
              superconductor, neutron absorption spectroscopy and channeling                 
              radiation spectroscopy. These measurements will provide a                      
              quantitative measure of the amplitude of the atomic vibrations that            
              can be correlation with the superconducting properties.  The                   
              experiments will involve collaborations with the Oak Ridge National            
              Laboratory and with Aarhus University in Denmark
