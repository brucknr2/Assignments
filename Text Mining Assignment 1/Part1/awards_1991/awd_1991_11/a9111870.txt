Abstract    :
                   A comparative theoretical study of the interactions of                    
              positron and of electrons with atoms will be made.  The                        
              research will include the following topics:                                    
                   1.  Positronium formation in ground and excited states                    
              with high positron impact energy.                                              
                   2.  Comparison of theoretical calculations of collision                   
              cross sections for various processes with positron and                         
              electron impact.                                                               
                   3.  Annihilation and thermalization of positrons and the                  
              transport of electrons in various gases.                                       
                   The theoretical methods used optical scattering                           
              potentials for the collision cross section calculations and                    
              time dependent solutions of the Boltzmann equation in order to                 
              estimate the time dependence of various parameters related to                  
              electron or positron transport.
