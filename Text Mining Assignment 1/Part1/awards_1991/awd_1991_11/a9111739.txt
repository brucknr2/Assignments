Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program supports research by Dr. John A. Morrison of the                       
              Chemistry Department, University of Illinois at Chicago,                       
              concerning polyhedral boron halide clusters.  Divalent anions                  
              with equivalent numbers (n) of boron and halide atoms                          
              (including n = 7, 8, 10, 11, 12) will be synthesized and their                 
              reactivities and structures characterized using PES, XPS, NMR,                 
              and X-ray crystallography.  Diboron tetrahalides and tetraboron                
              tetrahalides and B(14)Cl(18) will also be studied.                             
              Substituents will not be limited to halides, but also will                     
              include alkyl, alkoxide, and amide groups.  The goal of the                    
              research is to investigate the bonding modes of these electron                 
              deficient compounds which are expected to exhibit structures                   
              not previously observed in boron clusters.  Molecular orbital                  
              calculations will facilitate the interpretation of spectra and                 
              bonding.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Large regular polyhedral clusters containing up to 12 boron                    
              atoms are well known.  Each boron is typically bound also to a                 
              hydrogen or halide atom.  The number of "framework" electrons                  
              required to hold the cluster together is usually 2n+2, where n                 
              is the number of boron atoms in the cluster.  Morrison will                    
              synthesize novel species which contain only 2n electrons and                   
              observe the effects on the shape and reactivity of the cluster                 
              and its bonding characteristics.  Although the research is                     
              fundamental, it may be applicable to clusters of other                         
              elements, particularly those containing metals which are found                 
              in many catalytic and electronic materials.
