Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will study                        
              electron transfer thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanisms of                  
              enzyme action for cytochrome c oxidase.  The enzyme will be                    
              adsorbed to a gold electrode and embedded in a lipid bilayer.                  
              Through both electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements                    
              (including magnetic circular dichroism) the electrical and                     
              structural dynamics of oxidation/reduction processes will be                   
              studied.  The use of lipid bilayers will keep enzyme subunits                  
              from clustering at the electrode surface, improving the                        
              likelihood that the dynamics observed correspond to the                        
              specific units desired rather than to agglomorates.

              Cytochrome c is a ubiquitous biological transfer agent.  The                   
              efficiency of respiration and photosynthesis are largely                       
              dependent on the dynamics of electron transfer between                         
              cytochrome c and two enzymes: cytochrome c oxidase and                         
              cytochrome c reductase.  This research will study the electron                 
              transfer dynamics by adsorbing cytochrome c reductase on a gold                
              electrode, otherwise covered by a lipid bilayer to emulate a                   
              cell membrane.  The goal of the work is to observe conformation                
              changes in the enzyme as a result of electron transfer; such                   
              changes are hypothesized to be an essential feature of                         
              efficient biological electron transfer processes.
