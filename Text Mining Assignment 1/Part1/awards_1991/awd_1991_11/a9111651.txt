Abstract    :
              The development of efficient packet routing algorithms is a very               
              important task in the construction of parallel computers.  In a                
              parallel architecture, different computing elements must be able to            
              communicate with each other fast while the size of the message                 
              (packet) queues created during the routing must be bounded, ideally,           
              to a small constant.  Through packet routing, real machines are able           
              to simulate idealized machines and theoretical models can be tested            
              and tuned.  Up to now, the best existing permutation packet routing            
              algorithm on the mesh architecture is by Leighton, Makedon and Tollis          
              which routes the packets to their destination in optimal time and with         
              constant size queues.  However, drastically new methodologies are              
              needed to make these results practical.                                        
                                                                                             
              Two types of parallel communication algorithms will be considered,             
              online and off-line on multidimensional meshes and tori.  Off-line             
              packet routing is used in cases where the communication pattern is             
              known in advance, before the execution, or for computations in which           
              the data dependencies are fixed before run-time.  Universal                    
              approximation algorithms for packet routing on meshes and tori will            
              also be examined for completing the routing in the cases of actual             
              problems.  A universal approach is also needed in the case of off-line         
              routing, that can be applied to any pattern, such as many to one               
              routing.
