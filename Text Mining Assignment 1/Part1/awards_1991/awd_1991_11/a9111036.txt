Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks to contribute to the conceptualization of                  
              vulnerability in hazards and to an enlarged view of hazard                     
              management through the examination of shifts in vulnerability                  
              through management efforts, resource development, and local ability            
              to manage consequences of oil spills along the Strait of Malacca.              
              Through interviews with members of a fishing community, the factors            
              and linkages between the biophysical vulnerability and the economic            
              and social dimensions of vulnerability and potential coping                    
              strategies will be investigated in depth.  The results should                  
              contribute to an enhanced understanding of how vulnerability can               
              be systematically analyzed and incorporated into an integrated                 
              assessment of risk and risk management opportunities.
