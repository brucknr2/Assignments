Abstract    :
              This research is on verification of circuit timing properties.  The            
              approach is to develop a multiple event timing verifier, which                 
              operates at gate level, represents multiple transitions on signals,            
              and works on synchronous as well as asynchronous circuits.                     
              Algorithms that perform analysis in low order polynomial time and              
              use a data representation that accurately captures the digital                 
              behavior of the system are being explored.  Algorithm designs and              
              related software being developed include functions such as:                    
              verifying circuits with non-trivial input timing, allowing multiple            
              transitions on signals, doing functional analysis to eliminate                 
              false paths, allowing designers to input and examine data easily,              
              verifying different clocking disciplines, and detecting various                
              timing problems, such as clock rate not met, pulse shortening,                 
              hazards and races.
