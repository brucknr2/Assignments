Abstract    :
                   The proposal outlines two activities both of which are                    
              aimed at a study of decays of heavy quarks through the weak                    
              interaction.  The investigator has joined a collaboration in                   
              an experiment at Fermilab (E791) aimed at the production from                  
              pion nucleus collisions of large numbers of mesons containing                  
              the charmed quark.  Her role in this is to study form factors                  
              in semileptonic decays of these mesons, and also the                           
              possibility of D0 anti D0 mixing - a phenomenon which has                      
              already been observed in the strange and bottom quark mesonic                  
              counterparts.  The PI also proposes to continue her                            
              involvement in the research and development required in the                    
              possible evolution of an experiment aimed at a study of CP                     
              violation in the weak decays of b quarks.  This experiment                     
              would center about an asymmetric e+e- accelerator facility                     
              producing large numbers of B mesons known as a B Factory.  She                 
              is already involved in detector development relevant to the                    
              use of such a facility, and proposes to continue to evaluate                   
              Helium gas drift chambers in particular.
