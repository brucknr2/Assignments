Abstract    :
                   The main motivation of the research is the development of                 
              physically realistic and computationally manageable                            
              theoretical procedures which can be applied to studies of                      
              complex atomic structures.  Work during the grant period will                  
              concentrate on extending our recently developed CI procedures                  
              for continuum states to multi-channel cases.  New work will be                 
              directed towards detailed calculations of widths and positions                 
              of doubly excited autoionizing states, excited states with                     
              inner shell vacancies and multiphoton processes.
