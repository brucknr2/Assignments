Abstract    :
              This travel services work order (CTS-91-AUS-05) supports the                   
              transportation of eleven U.S. scientists to participate in the                 
              Joint Symposium on Electron and Ion Swarms and Low-Energy Electron             
              Scattering, to be held in Gold Coast, Australia, July 18-20, 1991.             
              The meeting takes place under the auspices of the U.S.-Australia               
              Cooperative Science Program, and brings together two related                   
              symposia, one focusing on basic collisional processes and the                  
              other emphasizing applications of such processes to other fields               
              of science, such as aeronomy, and to working technological                     
              devices.  The U.S. co-organizers are Professor Vincent McKoy and               
              Dr. Sandor Trajmar, of the California Institute of Technology.                 
              The Australian co-organizer is Dr. S. J. Buckman, Australian                   
              National University, Canberra.  Australian participation is being              
              supported by the Australian Department of Industry, Technology,                
              and Commerce.  There will be additional participation from third               
              countries.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The interdisciplinary research to be discussed at the symposium is             
              relevant to several areas of plasma physics.  One aim of the                   
              meeting is to achieve a better understanding of the fundamental                
              processes occurring in such applications of plasmas as electrical              
              discharge devices (e.g. lamps and lasers), plasma processing of                
              materials, flue gas clean-up, and magnetohydrodynamic power                    
              generation, among others.  To date, many successful applications               
              of plasmas have been developed empirically, because of the lack of             
              such a basic understanding of the processes involved.  Further                 
              advances in the technology may be expected from enhancing the                  
              interaction between pure and applied science in this field, an                 
              important goal of the symposium.
