Abstract    :
              This research investigates Bayesian methods for constructing                   
              probabilistic networks from databases.  Its main focus is on                   
              constructing Bayesian belief networks.  Primary goals are to (1)               
              develop methods for calculating the probability of a Bayesian                  
              belief-network structure given a database of cases, (2) identify               
              the most probable belief-network structure given a database of                 
              cases, and (3) perform probabilistic inference by taking a                     
              weighted average over the inferences of multiple belief networks.              
              Potential applications include computer-assisted hypothesis                    
              testing, automated scientific discovery, and automated                         
              construction of probabilistic expert systems.  Methods will be                 
              explored for intergrateing prior knowledge with data, handling                 
              missing data, and discovering hidden (latent) variables.  Of                   
              particular concern is the development of computationally                       
              efficient algorithms.  The methods developed will be empirically               
              evaluated using databases from several domains.
