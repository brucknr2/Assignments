Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop a high-speed distributed               
              storage system that provides a general purpose file system with                
              integrated storage and retrieval of large data objects, such as                
              digital audio and video, at guaranteed data rates.  Applications of            
              such a system range from visualization of scientific computations to           
              real-time recording, editing and play-back of color video.                     
              Support for integrated access to continuous media such as digital              
              audio and video is difficult for current computing systems.  They lack         
              the necessary capacity to provide data at a sufficient rate, and do            
              not support the necessary end-to-end performance guarantees.  The              
              interest in fields such as scientific visualization require that this          
              be addressed.                                                                  
              The design, called Swift, addresses these issues by providing a                
              scalable architecture capable of exploiting current and future                 
              technologies.  In particular, to provide high performance it relies on         
              the rapidly increasing performance of communication networks to use            
              many storage devices in parallel.  It will provide the end-to-end              
              performance guarantees necessary for continuous multimedia through             
              negotiations with the schedulers of each of the cooperating                    
              components.  Its distributed nature will allow resource sharing                
              according to the needs of its clients; and, through the use of                 
              redundancy, it will provide a high degree of fault tolerance.
