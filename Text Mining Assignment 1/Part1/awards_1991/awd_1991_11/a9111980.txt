Abstract    :
              This project will focus on three aspects of finite automata.                   
              1.  The role of randomness in finite automata.  The class of functions         
                  computed by two-way probabilistic finite automata will be studied.         
                  Techniques for proving non-membership will be developed, and               
                  different notions of acceptance will be considered.                        
              2.  Succinctness of representations.  Techniques for proving lower             
                  bounds on the size complexity of finite automata will be                   
                  developed.                                                                 
              3.  Complexity of minimization problems.  The computational                    
                  complexities of several conversions of a finite automaton of one           
                  type into a minimal automation of another type will be determined.         
                  Of particular importance is the diversity-based representation of          
                  an automaton, which has applications in the theory of learning.            
              In addition, some problems on program instance checking will be                
              investigated.
