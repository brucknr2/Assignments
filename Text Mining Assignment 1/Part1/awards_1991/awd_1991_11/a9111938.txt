Abstract    :
                   This will try to identify homologous regions of the                       
              polydnaviruses from different parasitic wasp groups in an attempt              
              to determine the phylogenetic affinities of the viruses.  These                
              trees can then be compared to those of the wasps for congruence                
              testing.  The polydnavirus association with the wasps is an                    
              extremely interesting relationship and represents the only known               
              example of mutualism between eukaryotes and viruses.  It appears               
              that the virus is necessary for the wasp to successfully complete              
              its lifecycle since the products that it produces successfully                 
              suppresses the host immune response to the parasitoids.  A                     
              determination of when this trait arose and if it is lineage                    
              specific would be highly valuable to a wide range of individuals               
              in the scientific community and may also have wide ranging effects             
              in the insect control community.  The procedures to be attempted               
              are new and offer a high potential return if the project is                    
              successful.
