Abstract    :
              The project examines calculations of protein electrostatic                     
              properties and electrostatic interactions with charged                         
              surfaces.  The detailed molecular structure of the proteins is                 
              used in calculating the local and the mean molecular surface                   
              potential.  A new boundary-integral method, which includes                     
              calculation of nonlinear electric double layer effects, is                     
              used.  The results are used as a basis for precise                             
              calculations of electrophoretic mobilities and adsorption                      
              equilibria of proteins.  Experiments aim at determining                        
              electrophoretic mobilities for electrophoretic separations and                 
              ion exchange chromatographic retention separations.//
