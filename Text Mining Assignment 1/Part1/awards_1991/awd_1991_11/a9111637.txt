Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              This is a pilot project to develop and refine a suitable survey                
              methodology for investigating some key features of language                    
              change in progress.  Studies of sound change over the past two                 
              centuries have led to the formulation of a number of general                   
              principles governing the spread of sound change.  Though some                  
              specific quantitative models incorporating these principles have               
              been developed on the basis of specific community studies,                     
              efforts to confirm the models on a larger scale have been                      
              limited.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The aim of this pilot project is to lay the groundwork for                     
              collecting a continental sample of North American English, with                
              the aim of a quantitative, empirical test of four general                      
              principles of sound change.  The pilot project will focus on an                
              area of the upper U. S. Midwest, including Northern Illinois,                  
              Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.  Speech samples from this area                 
              will be obtained via telephone interviews, and the results                     
              analyzed by both instrumental and traditional techniques of                    
              phonetic analysis.  The pilot project will test and improve the                
              research methodology, providing the basis for developing the                   
              broader-scale project to be carried out in the future.
