Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports a cultural anthropologist and two                        
              sociologists in a continuing study of how households in a mid-                 
              sized Mexican city respond to the continuing economic crisis.                  
              Previous research dating from 1977 identified a sample of                      
              households and interviewed them on their social and economic                   
              activities.  this project will re-interview the households and                 
              focus on ethnic differences in the city itself, as well as extend              
              the sample to three secondary center surrounding this regional                 
              core.  The study will focus on the households as decision-making               
              bodies trying to adapt to changing and uncertain prospects for                 
              earning a living.                                                              
                                                                                             
              this research is important because it is the first study of a                  
              Latin American city based on longitudinal survey data combined                 
              with long-term ethnography.  Understanding the strategies of                   
              these households will help planners deal with the effects of                   
              changing macro-level economic policies which create or diminish                
              local jobs, which then increase or decrease labor migration form               
              Mexico into the US.
