Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Houston Gene-Server was made public in 1988 as               
              an electronic mail server for Genbank entries.  At that time,                  
              such a service was not available elsewhere (now Intelligenetics                
              is also providing a similar service).  Over time, support for the              
              PIR database was added, and various analytical software packages               
              were also added to the distribution system.  Today, PIR entries                
              are updated quarterly, GenBank weekly, and software as available.              
              GeneServer also provides anonymous ftp access to its contents.                 
              The Gene-Server has now been operating for 26 months and has                   
              responded to more than 5000 requests for information from                      
              researchers around the world.  With additional support, the                    
              system will be expanded with additional disk space and additional              
              services to meet the needs of the molecular biology community.
