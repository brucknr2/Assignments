Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a feasibility investigation into the                           
              possible use of thermoplastic wastes in soil grouting.                         
              Potential uses would be to improve soil foundations, slope                     
              stabilization, and possible building blocks for retaining                      
              walls and similar applications.
