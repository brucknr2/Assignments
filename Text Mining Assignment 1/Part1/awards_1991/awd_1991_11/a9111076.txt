Abstract    :
              Research to be carried out under a Research Initiation Award                   
              is focused on mean flow and wave motion in the coastal surf                    
              zone.  The study will be mostly experimental, utilizing a                      
              laboratory wave flume.  Experimental results will be                           
              integrated into an already developed model for the prediction                  
              of sediment transport.  Video imaging of dyed flow tracers and                 
                                                                                             
              fluorescent dyed sand grains will yield qualitative and                        
              quantitative details of flow and sediment dynamics with wave                   
              shoaling and breaking included.                                                
              The research will advance the ability to predict beach                         
              response to storms, and evaluate protective system.
