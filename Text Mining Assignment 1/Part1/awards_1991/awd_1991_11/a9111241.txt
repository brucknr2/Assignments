Abstract    :
              This research aims at applying high-speed digital communication and            
              switching technologies to computer systems.  Typical applications              
              to be considered includes interconnection of processor subsystems              
              among themselves for multiprocessor configurations, and the                    
              interconnection of processors to I/O subsystems.  These                        
              applications require high bandwidth, low latency, and low error-               
              rate beyond the capability of current electrical buses and O/I                 
              channels.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              It studies the applicability of various high-speed interconnection             
              technologies and the development of new architectures and protocols            
              suitable in a computer system environment.  It uses fiber-optics               
              as the link technology and high-speed crossbar switches for                    
              interconnection.  The structure of these switches, as well as                  
              mechanisms for connection setup, routing, and flow-control across              
              multiple cascaded switches are studied.  In addition, fast                     
              connection setup within a switch by the use of multiple controllers            
              are also investigated.  Alternate interconnection technologies such            
              as optical subcarrier multiplexing are also investigated as low-               
              cost replacements for the switch.  Experimental evaluation of the              
              concepts is performed on a testbed consisting of IBM RS/6000 AND               
              PS/2 high-performance workstations equipped with 100 Mbits/s                   
              optical link cards
