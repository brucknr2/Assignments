Abstract    :
                   This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Owen's                  
              sabbatical studies in the laboratory of Dr. Andrew Caton at the                
              Wistar Institute in Philadelphia.  Dr. Owen's goal is to learn                 
              molecular genetic techniques such as gene sequencing, in order to              
              apply them to her ongoing studies on the changes in ligand                     
              repertoire expression which accompany immune memory generation.                
                                                                                             
              By expanding her expertise in this way, Dr. Owen will be poised to             
              make significant new contributions to the question of how immune               
              memory and secondary immunization are translated into                          
              diversification of V region genes for a given hapten.  The skills              
              to be learned, and the results to be obtained from their                       
              application to Dr. Owen's research problem, are anticipated to                 
              significantly enhance Dr. Owen's career.
