Abstract    :
                   The investigator analyzes large systems of coupled                        
              oscillators that arise in various branches of biology and                      
              condensed-matter physics.  A common theme is the spontaneous                   
              emergence of synchronization due to cooperative interactions                   
              among the oscillators.  The systems of ordinary differential                   
              equations that constitute the models will be investigated                      
              analytically and numerically.  Techniques to be used include                   
              methods of dynamical systems, bifurcation theory, statistical                  
              mechanics, and numerical simulation.  Real-time computer                       
              visualization of the many-oscillator dynamics plays a crucial                  
              heuristic role in the research. Several of the tasks are expected              
              to generate experimentally testable predictions.                               
                   The mathematical problems studied here are models of                      
              behavior as varied as the beating of a heart, the patterned                    
              flashing of groups of fireflies, or the circadian rhythm.                      
              Specific areas to be studied include: phase models with a large                
              but finite number of oscillators; pulse-coupled oscillators with               
              distributed frequencies or local coupling; phase-locking and                   
              invariant 2-tori in arrays of Josephson junctions; arrays of                   
              electronic relaxation oscillators; coupled oscillator models of                
              the Drosophila circadian system; and delayed switching                         
              of charge-density waves.
