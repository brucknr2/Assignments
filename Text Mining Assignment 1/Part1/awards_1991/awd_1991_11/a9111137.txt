Abstract    :
                   The objectives of this project are to characterize the                    
              important soil weathering processes associated with the transport              
              and/or retention of radionuclides in soils, to determine the role              
              of various soil constituents in providing sites for radionuclide               
              accumulation, and to develop radiation potential maps which augment            
              existing soil and geological maps.  The work will be accomplished              
              in two phases: a field study relating soil properties to                       
              radioactivity levels, and a laboratory leaching experiment which               
              simulates weathering of soil materials belonging to a                          
              representative range of radioactivity-level groups.
