Abstract    :
                   The mammals in the carnivore family Procyonidae all live in               
              the New World and all are arboreal (tree-climbing) to some                     
              extent.  Up to four of the five living genera coexist in the same              
              forests in Central and South America, but little is known about                
              their habitat requirements or the way the forest is apportioned                
              among them.  The P.I. has studied the limb anatomy and limb                    
              kinematics of these animals in an attempt to understand the                    
              diversity of biomechanical solutions to be problems of food                    
              acquisition, escape from predators, and movement through a                     
              complex, three-dimensional habitat.  These lines of inquiry have               
              led to several hypotheses regarding the functional and ecological              
              significance of procyonid locomotor patterns, limb proportions,                
              and food-handling behaviors that require field work to test.                   
              Studies of muscle structure and measurement of museum specimens                
              are not sufficient to elucidate the radiation of this taxon into               
              a wide range of adaptive types.  This planning grant is designed               
              to investigate the feasibility of locating, radio-tracking, and                
              capturing the lesser known procyonids to obtain data on (1)                    
              movement patterns and habitat use in the field, (2) limb use                   
              behaviors (locomotion and food handling) of wild animals under                 
              field and laboratory conditions, and (3) the extent to which                   
              differences in locomotion and food-handling abilities prevent                  
              overlap in habitat use by procyonid genera and species.
