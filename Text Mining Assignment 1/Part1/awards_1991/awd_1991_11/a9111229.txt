Abstract    :
              This research seeks to develop a technology for IC-                            
              processed, piezoelectric, diaphragm transducers;                               
              particularly a microphone, a speaker, and an IR                                
              sensor.  Characterization and modelling of the                                 
              microphone will be performed, and optimum                                      
              performance will be sought.  Various designs and                               
              structures of the microphone will be fabricated and                            
              characterized.  CAD tools for analysis, simulation,                            
              and optimization of the piezoelectric diaphragm will                           
              be developed to aid the design process, and to                                 
              support generic microelectromechanical structures                              
              built on a diaphragm, a bridge or a cantilever with                            
              composite layers.  The proposed IR sensor will use                             
              the pyroelectric effect of ZnO that is sitting on a                            
              very thin and large diaphragm (a few microns thick                             
              and a few millimeters square).
