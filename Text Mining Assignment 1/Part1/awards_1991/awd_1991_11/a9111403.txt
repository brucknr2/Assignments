Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to establish a framework needed to             
              model Holocene archaeological sites in Arctic Alaska in relation               
              to global and regional climate patterns. Subfossil wood from                   
              archaeological sites, living trees and driftwood collected in the              
              Kobuk River area in northwestern will be used to extend tree-ring              
              data back to 1000-2000 BP. This dendrochronological data can be                
              used to reconstruct past climate patterns and date archaeological              
              sites. The results of this project will significantly expand the               
              understanding of the chronology of cultural development and human              
              adaptation in the western Arctic, and contribute to an                         
              understanding of global climate change.
