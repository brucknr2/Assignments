Abstract    :
                   The proposed effort will focus on extension and application               
              of an existing, two-dimensional, numerical model of the mid- and               
              low-latitide current systems within the ionosphere.  This                      
              variable-grid model is based on magnetic field-line integrated                 
              quantities and solves for scales from global down to medium (5km)              
              electric fields.  First, the model will be used to investigate                 
              the evening perturbation to the Sq (solar quiet) current system                
              which is responsible for the rapid rise of the ionosphere after                
              local solar sunset.  This will provide a self-consistent                       
              numerical test of the theory presented by Haerendel et al.                     
              ?1990! on the post-sunset rise.  Once the numerical study of the               
              global scale electric field is completed, a finer grid will be                 
              employed to investigate the explosive development of                           
              irregularities within the evening F Region plasma called                       
              Equatorial Spread F (ESF).  While the driving mechanism of ESF is              
              well understood (gravitational Rayleigh-Taylor instability), the               
              initiation or "seeding of the instability process is still not                 
              established.  Initially, seeding will be omitted to see if                     
              Equatorial Spread F develops from the nonlinear first order                    
              electric field variation.  Then seeding from neutral-                          
              wave/ionosphere interactions such as spatial resonance effects                 
              will be examined.
