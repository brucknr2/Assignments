Abstract    :
              This project is a group award to the PIs and Professors V. Barbu               
              and S. Stojanovic to study a wide range of topics in Optimal                   
              Control Theory.  Hamiltonian inclusions with applications to                   
              antiperiodic functions and control of free boundary value                      
              problems are the main topics to be developed.                                  
                   These studies have applications to the design of control                  
              systems.  A particular example arising in electro-photography                  
              will be studied at length due to its immediate technological                   
              applicability.
