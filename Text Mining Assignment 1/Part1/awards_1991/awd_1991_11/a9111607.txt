Abstract    :
              Part of the VLSI synthesis problem is mapping the Boolean equations            
              onto a given set of primitive cells to minimize a total given cost             
              function.  The latter can be time (performance) or area or both.               
              This process, called technology mapping,  has solutions for Boolean            
              tree networks.  Algorithms for this are based on one-dimensional               
              dynamic programming.  The problem of doing the technology mapping              
              of Boolean networks, represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs),            
              is being explored.  The major focus in this work is timing issues.             
              Research tasks are:  (1) deriving optimal (in latency) technology              
              mapping algorithms for DAGs with recursive structures, and (2)                 
              extending these algorithmic techniques to arbitrary structures.                
              The optimization technique is based on multi-dimensional dynamic               
              programming.
