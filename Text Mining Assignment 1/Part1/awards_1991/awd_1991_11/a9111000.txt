Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Piezoelectric transducers have been exploited for their                        
              ability to detect minute interfacial mass changes.  The quartz                 
              crystal microbalance (QCM), comprising a thin wafer of AT-cut                  
              quartz sandwiched between two metallic excitation electrodes,                  
              has been used extensively in this regard.  The format of the                   
              QCM is particularly attractive since AT-cut quartz crystals                    
              are inexpensive, easily handled and can be configured so that                  
              one of the excitation electrodes can be used as a working                      
              electrode in a conventional electrochemical cell.                              
              Applications of the QCM have been somewhat limited, however,                   
              by low sensitivity compared to other transducers because of                    
              the rather low operating frequencies (.10 MHz) of the QCM.                     
              This program aims to remove this obstacle by investigating the                 
              use of high frequency (up to 100 MHz), miniature chemically                    
              milled AT-cut quartz crystals in mass detection, both in vapor                 
              and liquid media.  The goals this project will be to                           
              demonstrate (1) the mass sensitivity of these crystals to                      
              metal deposition and adsorption of gaseous analytes into thin                  
              active films, (2) the viability and mass sensitivity of these                  
              devices in liquid media (3) detection of electrochemically                     
              induced mass changes, (4) the feasibility of various sensor                    
              configurations using these resonators and (5) the use of these                 
              crystals as viscosity sensors.
