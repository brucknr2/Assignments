Abstract    :
              This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will                                 
              support Watts of modelocked power at 1.053 um.                                 
              This laser, which generates 50 picosecond pulses, will                         
              be used to pump a near IR femtosecond dye laser,                               
              and also seed a Nd:YLF regenerative amplifier.  The                            
              proposed Nd:YLF laser will replace our failing                                 
              Nd:YAG laser and provide us with the needed                                    
              reliability and stability necessary to carry out planned                       
              fundamental and device studies on GaAs based                                   
              samples.  It will also allow us to extend our                                  
              femtosecond system operating wavelength from                                   
              870nm to 1.3 um and enable us to expand our time-                              
              resolved studies of optical nonlinearities to narrow                           
              gap InGaAs semiconductor materials.
