Abstract    :
              This project will study: i) the mechanisms of activation of                    
              neural tissue by magnetic stimulation; ii) calculate induced                   
              fields in various volume conductors; iii) simulate on the                      
              computer the effects of these fields using models of axons and                 
              neurons; and iv) design a coil capable of focussing the induced                
              fields.  This project also intends to test directly the efficacy               
              of this coil in both the peripheral nervous system and the                     
              central nervous system (CNS).  This combination of a theoretical               
              with an experimental approach should generate useful and                       
              important information about the mechanisms of magnetic                         
              stimulation and the efficacy of focussing magnetic fields for the              
              excitation of the nervous system.  This non-invasive method of                 
              stimulation should provide clinicians with a powerful tool to                  
              study and map normal brain function as well as diagnose certain                
              types of neural diseases provided that the mechanisms of the                   
              interactions between magnetic fields and neural tissue can be                  
              understood.
