Abstract    :
                   A computer system especially configured for analysis of                   
              multi-parameter coincidence data will be installed in the                      
              University of Pennsylvania Tandem Accelerator Laboratory.  The                 
              system, by utilizing several processors operating in parallel,                 
              will have a total computing capacity for sorting event-                        
              recorded data comparable to a large mainframe computer.  A                     
              massively parallel array of processors and disk drives will be                 
              assembled to constitute an "intelligent memory" to complement                  
              the computer system.
