Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is the investigation and the            
              implementation of partial differential equation solvers using                  
              analog VLSI circuits, specifically the design, fabrication and                 
              evaluation of a programmable analog laplace equation solvers.  The             
              main advantages of the proposed approach include speed improvement,            
              robustness and fault tolerance.  This research demonstrates the                
              feasibility of analog VLSI partial differential equation solvers.              
              It will have an impact on engineering disciplines where a real time            
              solution of these types of equations are required.
