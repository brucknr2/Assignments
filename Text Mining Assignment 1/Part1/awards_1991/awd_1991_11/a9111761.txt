Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop a further                          
              understanding of the biology of the vascular wall so as to                     
              provide guidance for the development of tissue-engineered                      
              vascular grafts for the bypass and replacement of diseased                     
              vessels.  This will be done by reconstituting a blood vessel                   
              in a laminar pulstile flow system.  A key question to be                       
              answered is whether cell-cell interactions, i.e. between                       
              endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, are                        
              required to create a blood vessel with functional integrity,                   
              particularly in regard to its endothelium.  The significance                   
              of this project is in its representing a further engineering                   
              of the in vitro environment so as to make it more                              
              physiologic, and in its contributing to our understanding                      
              of those factors necessary to achieve a normally functioning                   
              blood vessel. This is important whether it be for vascular                     
              biology studies in cell culture or for the development of                      
              vascular prostheses, either hybrid grafts or living blood                      
              vessel equivalents.
