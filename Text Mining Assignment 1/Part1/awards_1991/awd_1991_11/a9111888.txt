Abstract    :
                   The complicated geographical variations in color pattern                  
              within species of Heliconius butterflies have piqued the interest              
              of biologists for more than a century. The advent of simple                    
              molecular biological techniques has provided researchers with a                
              new source of data to interpret these patterns, including the                  
              complex array of mimetic forms which have defied explanation till              
              now. A survey of intraspecific variation in DNA of Heliconius                  
              species will provide an independent hypothesis of the history of               
              colonization and divergence among the geographical races within                
              each species.                                                                  
                   Under the guidance of faculty sponsor Richard Harrison,                   
              graduate student Andrew Brower will collect butterflies in South               
              America and then conduct laboratory analyses of morphological and              
              molecular features of these samples. The data will contribute to               
              distinguishing between two major explanations for the patterns of              
              wing color patterns: allopatric divergence during the Pleistocene,             
              or parapatric divergence due to natural selection across narrow                
              ecological clines. As well, the study will advance modern attempts             
              to disentangle historical, phylogenetic causes of change from                  
              current ecological adaptations that also lead to change over short             
              time spans.
