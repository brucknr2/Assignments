Abstract    :
              The object of this research project is to adapt a dynamic                      
              programming model of retirement behavior developed by the author               
              of this study and a computational strategy developed by others to              
              address a number of important questions regarding the Social                   
              Security System.  Among the questions to be addressed are:                     
                   (1) How will changes in the 1983 Social Security amendments               
                   affect retirement behavior?  How much will it affect the                  
                   labor supply of older workers?                                            
                   (2) What  kinds of individuals will self select delayed                   
                   retirement credit because of increases in these credits?                  
                   (3) Are the new rules fair in actuarial sense?  What will be              
                   the net impact on total Social Security outlays?                          
                   (4) More generally, what is the form of an efficient Social               
                   Security policy?                                                          
                                                                                             
              These questions will be addressed by estimating utility functions              
              with a data set of male workers taken from the Retirement History              
              Survey.  This research is important because it will answer                     
              questions about the impact of changes in the Social Security System            
              on the viability of the system and on the benefits to recipient.
