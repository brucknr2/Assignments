Abstract    :
                   The interactions between scales of motion in the atmosphere               
              is an area of high research priority.  Better understanding of                 
              these processes is believed necessary for improved fundamental                 
              understanding and better forecasting of extreme weather events                 
              such as locally heavy rains, severe icing conditions, heavy fogs,              
              etc.                                                                           
                   The Principal Investigators will use two advanced numerical               
              models and diagnostic studies to investigate the important                     
              physical factors controlling the weather within a cyclonic storm               
              system and how small spatial scale disturbances within the                     
              cyclonic system are affected by the larger scale motions and how               
              the smaller scale systems impact the larger scale cyclone.
