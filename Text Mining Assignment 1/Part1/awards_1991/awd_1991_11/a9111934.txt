Abstract    :
              The Department of Electrical Engineering at                                    
              Princeton University will purchase equipment for                               
              Auger Electron Spectroscopy and                                                
              photoluminescence experiments.  The goal of the                                
              research supported by the equipment is to grow                                 
              new semiconductor materials which may be useful                                
              for integrating light-emitting elements on                                     
              conventional integrated circuits.  The materials                               
              under investigation are alloys and multiple layer                              
              structures of silicon and germanium, the layers of                             
              which may be only one atomic layer thick.  The                                 
              layers will be grown using gas sources and a rapid                             
              heating process that is amenable to large scale                                
              manufacturing.  A process to repeatedly grow single                            
              atomic layers in a self-limiting fashion will also be                          
              investigated.
