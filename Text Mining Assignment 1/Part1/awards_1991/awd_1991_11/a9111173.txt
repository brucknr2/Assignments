Abstract    :
              Although Doppler weather radar systems have been used as research              
              tools for many years, they are just moving into operational use with           
              the multi-agency federal program called NEXRAD (Next Generation                
              Weather Radar).  Each of the 175 radars in the NEXRAD network will be          
              collecting data at the rate of several megabytes per minute.  Such             
              large amounts of complex atmospheric data cannot be assimilated                
              without computerized analysis to reduce the data and make it more              
              comprehensible to the meteorologist.                                           
                                                                                             
              This project will utilize visualization techniques to enhance the              
              meteorologist's comprehension of the BVP kinematic analysis and its            
              relationship to the three-dimensional reflectivity structure.  A               
              system will be built by combining scientific visualization techniques          
              and single Doppler kinematic analysis procedures for banded                    
              precipitation structures.  The ultimate goal of the project is to              
              produce a model visualization environment to serve as a powerful tool          
              for atmospheric scientists studying the physics and dynamics of                
              precipitation systems.
