Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is focussed on the electrochemical synthesis of                  
              metallic multilayered specimens.  Four metallic multilayers,                   
              cobalt/copper, chromium/iron, chromium/cobalt, and iron/copper,                
              have been shown recently to exhibit giant magneto-resistance                   
              effects.  The multilayers are produced through sophisticated                   
              electrochemistry processing carefully controlled to produce defined            
              variations in layer thicknesses and interface sharpness.  High                 
              resolution transmission electron microscopy combined with computer             
              imaging is employed to examine the perfection of the layers, the               
              epitaxy, and defect structure.  Radial distribution analysis                   
              details nearest neighbor environments.  Magnetic techniques are                
              used to probe interface properties.

              This research should enhance understanding of the processing and               
              nature of metallic multilayers.  Such materials have many potential            
              applications, for example, magnetic heads and magnetic storage                 
              elements.
