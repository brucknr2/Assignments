Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will study iterated            
              function systems (IFS's) and subdivision algorithms (SDA's) in the             
              context of dyadic iteration schemes governed by certain functional             
              equations.  The method of attack will involve analytical and                   
              numerical techniques that are based upon wavelet theory.  The                  
              overall research plan has points of contact with the work on                   
              fractal geometry that is being conducted currently at Georgia Tech.            
              In particular, the principal investigator will look at the                     
              following three interrelated aspects of solutions of functional                
              equations:  dimension and smoothness, the singularity spectrum and             
              the inverse problem.                                                           
                   The analysis of the geometry of sets of fractal dimension                 
              involves a number of different areas of mathematics, and it is safe            
              to say that this subject has breathed new life into several parts              
              of classical analysis.  In this project the principal investigator             
              will apply techniques from the theory of wavelets to study the                 
              properties of solution sets of functional equations whose graphs               
              are fractals.  Her approach will combine analytical and numerical              
              methods, and she will be collaborating with the leading people in              
              this work that blends analysis with geometry.
