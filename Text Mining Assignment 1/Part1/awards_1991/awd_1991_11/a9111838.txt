Abstract    :
              The School of Electrical Engineering at Cornell                                
              University will purchase a Nd:YAG laser under this                             
              NSF Engineering Research Equipment Grant which                                 
              will be dedicated to support engineering research.                             
              The Nd:YAG laser will be installed in a central                                
              electro-optics laboratory, and will be used for the                            
              following research projects:  ultrafast pulse generation                       
              for electro-optical device characterization; pumping a                         
              tunable color center laser beat frequency generator                            
              for frequency characterization of electro-optic                                
              devices; exploring new color center defects for                                
              possible lasing based on F+2 - like defects in KF and                          
              NaF; and exploring lasing in transition-metal-ion                              
              bearing crystals such as Cr3+ and Ti3+ doped                                   
              Forsterite, sapphire, and other likely hosts.  Using                           
              diffusion, thin-film growth, and ion-implantation, we                          
              will explore the feasibility of quickly making and                             
              evaluating new optical materials for lasing.  The                              
              fundamental output line at 1.6 um of the requested                             
              Nd:YAG laser will provide the pump source for most                             
              of these systems.  The second harmonic at 0.532 um                             
              will be used to explore the spectroscopy of energy                             
              transfer in solids.
