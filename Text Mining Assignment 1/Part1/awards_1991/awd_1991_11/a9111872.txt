Abstract    :
                   Work concerned with excited negative ions and with Rydberg                
              states of neutral molecules is continued with the objective of                 
              clarifying issues raised in recent work, and pursuing some new                 
              avenues in studies of He2- vibrational autodetachment, and                     
              predissociation product distributions from Rydberg states of                   
              diatomic and triatomic molecules.  In addition, the first studies              
              of the predissociation of molecular ion Rydberg states will be                 
              carried out using high-resolution techniques.  The work will                   
              yield important properties and decay pathways of these states,                 
              and new information on the electron capture processes by which                 
              the Rydberg states are produced.
