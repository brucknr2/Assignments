Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant will give partial support to a three-day                            
              multidisciplinary conference at the newly inaugurated Rutgers                  
              Center for Cognitive Science, October 31-November 2, 1991.  The                
              conference will be an opportunity for individuals representing                 
              the disciplines of Cognitive Psychology, Linguistics, Computer                 
              Science, Philosophy, and Neuroscience to address a common problem              
              in Cognitive Science and for the interchange to enrich the                     
              approach taken by each one.  The particular focus will be on a                 
              main area of interdisciplinary activity within Cognitive Science,              
              the problem of understanding the Architecture of Intelligent                   
              Systems, the structure of information processing mechanisms and                
              systems of representation underlying intelligence.
