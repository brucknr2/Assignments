Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              be concerned with superstrings (which are one - dimensional                    
              objects) and their higher - dimensional generalizations, known                 
              as super p - branes.  In particular, the role of these objects                 
              as effective, long-distance descriptions of topological                        
              defects in supersymmetric quantum field theories will be                       
              explored.                                                                      
                   The theory of superstrings shows promise as a theory                      
              which would describe all of the forces of nature, including                    
              gravity.  Supersymmetry relates the particles which make up                    
              matter to those which carry the forces between bits of matter.                 
              The study of strings and their generalizations as topological                  
              defects has proved to be of importance in elucidating the                      
              nature of string theory.
