Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant provides support to continue a series of annual                     
              conferences on macroeconomics.  These conferences, which started               
              in 1986, have made a significant contribution to the testing of                
              empirical implications of new theories as well as the use of                   
              relevant theory to analyze policy issues of current interest.  The             
              conference series will continue to encourage the writing of                    
              empirically oriented papers by both established and promising young            
              economists.  In addition, the series will continue to serve as a               
              forum for communication among economists from the different schools            
              of macroeconomics.  The annual conference volume has become a                  
              widely cited and influential research reference.                               
                                                                                             
              This conference was created in 1986 to fill what was then perceived            
              to be a major problem in macroeconomic research, namely a widening             
              gap between the research frontiers and policy issues.  It seemed               
              at the time that young researchers in economics were doing little              
              empirical research and very rarely examining in any depth the                  
              empirical implications of their theories.  The conference also                 
              addresses another major problem in macroeconomics.  The field of               
              macroeconomics appears increasingly to be splitting into different             
              schools, which are not seriously communicating with each other.                
              Support is needed so that this successful conference series can                
              continue to address these problems in macroeconomics.
