Abstract    :
              This project is supported under the Research in Undergraduate                  
              Institutions Program.  The purpose of this research is to analyze              
              the impact of job characteristics on retirement.  A model is                   
              developed and estimated which takes into account the notion that               
              pensions and age of retirement are jointly determined, based on                
              comparison of a workers productivity and the marginal disutility               
              of work.  This differs from previous studies where age of                      
              retirement has been treated independent of these factors.  The                 
              model will be tested using data on characteristics of occupation               
              drawn from a number of sources and individual work histories from              
              the Retirement History Survey.  Several alternative specifications             
              will be tested, including continuous dependent variables,                      
              categorical dependent variables, and transition hazards.  This                 
              research is important because it will provide a better                         
              understanding of how retirement age may be affected by public                  
              policy regarding pensions, and how changes in retirement age might             
              affect the composition of the labor force.
