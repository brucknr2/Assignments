Abstract    :
              This award will investigate erbium-doped fiber                                 
              amplifiers (EDFAs), already recognized as                                      
              having changed the course of fiber optics                                      
              research recently.  EDFAs have emerged as the                                  
              undisputed champion lightwave communications,                                  
              and many experts believe that EDFAs will                                       
              revolutionize long-distance optical                                            
              communications, from video distribution to                                     
              broadband networking.  A new era has indeed                                    
              dawned upon the fiber optics community.                                        
              The work done will consolidate, and develop                                    
              further, the work already done under a NSF-                                    
              SGER award, in which a comprehensive                                           
              theoretical computer model was developed.  the                                 
              model can predict the performance of any type                                  
              of EDFA very accurately, as evidenced by the                                   
              excellent agreement with published experimental                                
              results.  Both theoretical and experimental                                    
              research work will be done and shall                                           
              concentrate on pumping in the 800 nm region.                                   
              This is aimed at the eventual realization of low                               
              cost, very reliable, performance optimized and                                 
              compact EDFA modules for use as power                                          
              amplifiers, line repeaters and preamplifiers in a                              
              variety of application in lightwave technology.                                
              EDFAs offer the exciting possibility of                                        
              developing completely transparent networks.                                    
              The shall also investigate theoretically amplifiers                            
              for the 1300 nm region with neodymium doped                                    
              fluoride glass, by considering optimized fiber                                 
              design and different pumping configurations.
