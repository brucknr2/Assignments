Abstract    :
              This renewal award is supported jointly by the Solid State                     
              Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research and the                
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program in                
              the Division of Chemistry. This magnetochemistry research                      
              program is devoted to the investigation of the chemical and                    
              structural features which determine the nature of cooperativity                
              in low dimensional compounds, especially systems that have                     
              unusual structures or exhibit phase transitions.  The                          
              importance of low-dimensional systems has been demonstrated by                 
              the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductors, which                
              are thought to be propagated through low-dimensional networks.                 
              New one-dimensional magnetic compounds, mainly bridged Cu(II)                  
              compounds, will be synthesized and characterized, both                         
              structurally and magnetically. Observed magnetic properties                    
              will be correlated with ab initio calculated values.                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Low-dimensional systems may have other important properties and                
              may find uses in switches, actuators, sensors, display devices                 
              and in logic circuits. A better understanding of the                           
              fundamental properties of low-dimensional systems will permit                  
              the design of substances with prescribed properties.
