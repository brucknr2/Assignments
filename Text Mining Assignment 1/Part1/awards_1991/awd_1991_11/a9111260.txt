Abstract    :
                   An outstanding problem in biology is whether natural                      
              selection acts at levels other than that of individual organisms.              
              Selection acting on group characteristics may be important but                 
              the biological processes that give rise to it are poorly                       
              understood.  Behavioral decision-making, in which animals                      
              discriminate among alternatives using group as well as individual              
              properties, is a source of group selection that has never been                 
              formally investigated.  The proposed research will develop and                 
              analyze models of group selection caused by three common types of              
              behavioral decision-making:  (1) choice of flowers by insect                   
              pollinators; (2) female mate-choice, and (3) host choice by                    
              plant-feeding insects.  Detailed formulations of decision-making               
              behavior will be combined with quantitative genetic models in                  
              order to link the observable properties of animal behaviors to                 
              their short-and long-term evolutionary consequences.  This will                
              provide the first analysis of a potentially-important form of                  
              group selection.  The results will identify those situations in                
              which group-level selection can be expected and will yield                     
              predictions that can be tested in natural populations.
