Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses the tendency of decision makers to incline             
              their actions toward some group norm.  Both rational and behavioral            
              explanations will be evaluated.  In the personal payoffs case,                 
              herding may be a rational result of gaining information from others            
              in like circumstances, or as a means of protection from other                  
              imperfectly informed participants with whom the action must                    
              deal (e.g., a firm concerned about lending banks).  Concerns about             
              regret, magnified for outlier actions, may encourage herding.                  
              In the externalities case, herding may be an attempt to avoid the              
              costs (self-perceived or externally imposed) of not meeting group              
              norms (e.g., on curtailing emissions to prevent global warming.)               
              Thus explicit agreements may substantially raise group norms,                  
              and may gain adherents even though the rational perscription is to             
              free-ride.  The proposed research will explore the roles of                    
              uncertainty and of the actor's perception of whether his decision              
              is pivotal in securing agreement by others.
