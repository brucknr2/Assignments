Abstract    :
                   This project initiates the first year of a five-year                      
              continuing award to the University of Arkansas to join with the                
              University of Cincinnati and Florida Atlantic University in merging            
              with Georgia Institute of Technology's Industry/University                     
              Cooperative Research Center for Material Handling.                             
                   The university has developed the company support to be added              
              to the Center's industry base.  The research projects approved by              
              the new consolidated Industry Advisory Board for the University of             
              Arkansas are "Improved Postal Pak Operations", "Analysis of Flat               
              Mail Containers", "Simulation Methodology to Support Process                   
              Manufacturing", and "Analysis of the Warehouse Layout Problems for             
              an Electronic Assembly Environment."                                           
                   A minority woman graduate student will augment the Center's               
              research by studying "the Extension of JIT Software Development to             
              Manufacturing Automation Alternatives."                                        
                   The researchers are experts in their fields and have the                  
              capability and facilities to participate in the new merged Center.             
                   The Program Manager recommends the University of Arkansas be              
              awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing grant.            
              An additional $20,500 for one year is recommended with funds                   
              provided by the Research Centers for Minority Scholars Program.                
                   Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                  
              and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review            
              the progress of the Center on a number of criteria, including the              
              following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                    
              interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to                 
              which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                 
              robust research program is developing.  If the review is                       
              satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend support of the               
              next period of this continuing grant.
