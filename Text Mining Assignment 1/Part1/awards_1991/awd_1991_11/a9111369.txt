Abstract    :
                   In the engineering design process, the decisions pertaining               
              to the topology of the system are in general, based on intuition               
              and experience.  Once the topology has been selected, the                      
              dimensional variables of the system are sized and optimized for the            
              selected topology.  This, however, may not provide the best                    
              solution since other competing topologies have already been                    
              rejected based on intuition.  This research plans to incorporate               
              topological decisions in the framework of design optimization.                 
              This will be done by using 0-1 design variables to represent                   
              topological decisions involving a choice between alternative                   
              designs.  Another related problem which will be addressed in this              
              research deals with the support of multidisciplinary considerations            
              in the design process.  This will be accomplished through a use of             
              multiple objective functions in the problem formulation.                       
                   This research will furnish a design tool which can be utilized            
              to (i) generate and evaluate the feasibility and relative merit of             
              alternative design concepts, (ii) help develop detailed optimum                
              designs for promising concepts, and (iii) will provide an impetus              
              for the development of better computer-aided design tools and                  
              optimization methodologies to help support preliminary and detailed            
              design activities.
