Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research combines the expertise of a chemist, Dr. Joseph                   
              Justice, and a biobehavioral scientist, Dr. Darryl Neill, in the               
              study of the relationship between neurochemistry and behavior. A               
              long standing impediment to understanding the brain has been the               
              inability to actually observe the changes that occur in the                    
              chemistry of the brain during behavior. To address this problem,               
              the investigators have developed a new methodology for in vivo                 
              measurement of the neurotransmitter dopamine. They will continue to            
              develop this sytem and apply it to neurchemical dynamics. Sensors              
              which sample the chemical environment of the brain will be used to             
              observe neurochemistry during behavior. These studies will                     
              contribute fundamental knowledge about the relationship between the            
              neurochemisrty of identified neural systems and well characterized             
              behaviors.
