Abstract    :
              The insect cell-baculovirus system                                             
              has received rapid and wide                                                    
              acceptance as a laboratory or small-                                           
              scale system for production of                                                 
              proteins from recombinant DNA, and                                             
              an "AIDS vaccine" produced by insect                                           
              cell systems is in clinical trials.                                            
              This system offers advantages of                                               
              safety, high productivity, generally                                           
              reliable production of active

              Since the post-translational                                                   
              processing machinery of insect cells                                           
              is not identical to that of                                                    
              mammalian cells, there may be some                                             
              limitation on the types of proteins                                            
              that are best produced in insect                                               
              cell systems.  However, products                                               
              from insect cells typically elicit                                             
              a strong immunogenic response, and                                             
              this system appears particularly                                               
              well-suited for use in vaccine

              In addition, the virus itself may be

              The overall objective of this

              may be required in large volumes,
