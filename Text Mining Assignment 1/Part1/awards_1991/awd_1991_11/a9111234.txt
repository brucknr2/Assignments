Abstract    :
              This is a Research Initiation Award dealing with                               
              modelling and analysis of switched electronic systems.                         
              The systems will be modelled by linear time varying                            
              periodic or quasi-periodic differential equations.  Using                      
              the theory established for such systems, predictions of                        
              stability, damping and harmonics will be done.  Such                           
              information will provide more qualitative information                          
              compared with time domain simulation.
