              (JTEC).  Its purpose is to assess the                                          
              status and trends of Japanese                                                  
              research and development in selected                                           
              technologies, thus contributing to                                             
              enhanced scientific and technological

              and Japan.                                                                     
                 JTEC assessments are performed by                                           
              panels of U.S. technical experts from
