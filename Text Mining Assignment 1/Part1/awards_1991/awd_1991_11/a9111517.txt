Abstract    :
                   Blue ribbon studies have noted the poor state of training of              
              students in observational aspects of atmospheric sciences.                     
              Previously, the Principal Investigator integrated "hands on"                   
              field experience with a formal graduate course.  This course on                
              the physics of clouds included a two week field component which                
              provided students with actual experience on a research aircraft                
              from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).                      
                   The Principal Investigator proposes a similar effort                      
              associated with studies in remote sensing.  In this case, the                  
              field component will include a two week field trip to the CHILL                
              national radar facility at Colorado State University.  The                     
              students will have use of the radar with guidance being provided               
              by the Principal Investigator and nationally recognized radar                  
              meteorologists from Colorado State University and the National                 
              Center for Atmospheric Research.  Each student will be assigned a              
              research area which will include weather targets of opportunity                
              as well as previously collected case studies which can be                      
              replayed over the radar system.
