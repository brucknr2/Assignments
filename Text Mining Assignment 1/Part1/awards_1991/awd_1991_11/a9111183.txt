Abstract    :
                   The object of this project is to consider the optimal planning            
              and control of complex stochastic inventory systems where batch                
              ordering must be used to exploit the economies of scale.  The                  
              research consists of problems that include analyses of basic                   
              single-item inventory systems and general multi-product multi-                 
              echelon systems, and optimization of generalized (s,S) systems.                
              For basic single-item inventory systems, the research is focused               
              on sensitivity analysis, which is designed to pave the path to                 
              effective research on more complex systems.  For multi-product                 
              multi-level systems, the research is focused on performance                    
              analysis of practical inventory control policies.  Since optimal               
              control of these systems is extremely difficult, the goal is to                
              develop practical inventory control policies with guaranteed worst             
              case performance.                                                              
                   This research addresses fundamental issues arising from                   
              planning complex stochastic inventory systems.  The anticipated                
              results will improve the understanding of complex inventory                    
              systems, and add significantly to inventory theory literature.
