Abstract    :
                   This project supports the collaboration between a group of                
              U.S. scientists at Clarkson University and a group of Russian                  
              scientists from University of Leningrad.  The research concerns the            
              study of nonlinear partial differential equations by the Inverse               
              Scattering Transform (IST) Method.  The IST method has been a                  
              successful and powerful method of solution in the 1+1 (one space               
              and one time dimension) setting.  The power of the IST method comes            
              from the fact that the solution of certain nonlinear partial                   
              differential equations can be reduced to the solution of the                   
              inverse problem for linear ordinary differential equations, and                
              such an inverse problem can usually be formulated as a Riemann-                
              Hilbert problem.  As a result, the solution of certain nonlinear               
              partial differential equations have been obtained simply by using              
              the methods to solve linear differential equations.  The                       
              generalization of the IST method to N+1, where N is greater than 1,            
              has not been as successful and so far some results have only been              
              obtained for N=2.  The Russian team at Leningrad is noted as one of            
              the top teams in the world in this area of science.  A                         
              collaboration would have significant scientific advantage to U.S.              
              scientists.                                                                    
                   The science supported in this US-USSR collaboration is in the             
              general area of partial differential equations.  This research                 
              topic concerns the equations of motion, fluid flow, physics, etc.              
              that model our physical universe.
