Abstract    :
              During a 15 month period, a general framework will be developed for            
              evaluating the effects of graphic representation of probability on             
              the biases and inconsistencies observed in preference assessment.              
              Development of the framework will require investigation of                     
              literature in visual information processing, cognitive modelling,              
              and cognitive complexity.  Conceptual developments from these                  
              studies will be used to design experimentation to explore the                  
              effects of graphic probability representations.  The framework for             
              modelling visual information processing and the experimental design            
              for testing this model will be described in a full grant proposal.
