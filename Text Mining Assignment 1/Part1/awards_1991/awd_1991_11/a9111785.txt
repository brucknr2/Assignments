Abstract    :
              This is a grant for research equipment to be used in                           
              research on microelectromechanical systems                                     
              (MEMS).  The overall objective of this research is                             
              the development of a new class of actuators,                                   
              sensors, and spatial light modulation devices, built                           
              on the integration of micro-chip sensing elements                              
              with moving mechanical elements.  In some devices,                             
              sensory feedback and model-based dynamics are                                  
              employed in order to control small object (0.5 to                              
              500 microns).  Specific applications include small                             
              sensors to measure strain, deflection, pressure,                               
              angular displacement, and force; small sensors                                 
              constructed to detect inertial parameters such as                              
              acceleration and roll rate; small, electromagnetically                         
              levitated elements whose orientation can be                                    
              controlled so that they function as reflecting                                 
              micropositioners for modulation of light beams; and                            
              small microactuators for cutting or imaging; and                               
              large-scale actuators built from micron-scale                                  
              components.
