Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The training program, "Molecular Approaches to Ion Channels",                  
              will provide advanced graduate students and professional                       
              scientists with in-depth exposure to a modern, multi-disciplinary              
              approach to the study of ion channels in cell membranes at the                 
              molecular level.  Methods covered include patch clamp applied to               
              native cells and transformed cells expressing cloned gene                      
              products, and biochemical and molecular analysis of channel                    
              expression.  Training provided by this course will directly have               
              an impact on the scientific community by guiding the efforts of                
              students and established investigators who are seeking to explore              
              new aspects of current research problems.
