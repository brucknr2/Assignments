Abstract    :
              This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority                
              Research Initiation program of the NSF, will provide for support               
              to develop a research proposal to address (1) the efficiency of a              
              residential water-to-air heat pump system by equipping it with                 
              state-of-the-art major components, and (2) the performance of                  
              environmentally acceptable refrigerants in such a system.
