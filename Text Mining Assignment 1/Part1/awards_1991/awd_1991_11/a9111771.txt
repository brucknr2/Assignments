Abstract    :
                   An experiment to measure parity non-conservation in the                   
              6P1/2-7P1/2 transition in atomic thallium will be conducted and                
              refined.  The objective is to observe this effect with sufficient              
              precision (~1% or better) to reveal the presence of a nuclear                  
              anapole moment in each naturally occurring thallium isotope:                   
              A=203 and A=205.  Research will also be carried out on P and P,T               
              odd effects in the rare earth dysprosium.  In order to determine               
              whether the proposed dysprosium experiments are practical, it is               
              first necessary to measure electric polarizabilities and                       
              lifetimes of a pair of metastable levels of opposite nominal                   
              parity.  This may lead to a major effort to search for the                     
              electric dipole moment of the electron in dysprosium.
