Abstract    :
              Neural networks offer a flexible, general purpose                              
              approach to building the complex highly nonlinear                              
              models that are required for a complex system such as                          
              a nuclear power plant.  Recent developments in                                 
              learning algorithms for neural networks provide                                
              alternatives to the traditional pattern recognition                            
              techniques for analysis of diagnostics.                                        
              This research planning grant involves a comprehensive                          
              bench mark test for feasibility study for nuclear reactor                      
              signal analysis via a neural network approach.  The test                       
              consists of a comparison between equipment                                     
              degradation monitoring by traditional time series                              
              analysis versus a neural network approach.
