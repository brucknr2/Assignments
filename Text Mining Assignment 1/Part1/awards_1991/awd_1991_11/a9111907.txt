Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to design part of an                         
              Intelligent Vehicle/Highway (IVHS).  Underlying IVHS                           
              is the belief that a dramatic increase in highway                              
              capacity can be achieved by the automatic control of                           
              vehicles in cooperation with an enhanced traffic                               
              management capability installed in the highway system.                         
              It is proposed to design and test a significant part of                        
              the control system dealing with maneuvers of cars in                           
              platoons.  As far as possible, the existing theory of                          
              discrete event systems will be used, making extensions                         
              to the theory when it is necessary.  The design effort                         
              will expose significant questions which the current                            
              theory cannot adequately address.  The design will be                          
              evaluated on a 1,000 vehicle simulation of a section of                        
              a highway.  It is hoped that the experiment will yield a                       
              ballpark estimate of how much highway capacity can be                          
              increased by IVHS.
