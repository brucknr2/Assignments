Abstract    :
              This project addresses some open questions in several domains of               
              theoretical computer science:  probabilistic methods, parallel                 
              computation, and computational and combinatorial geometry.  The                
              problems are related because they will be attacked by similar                  
              mathematical methods, principally tools from combinatorics and                 
              probability.  The progress that is made will either generate more              
              efficient algorithms for the tasks in question, or else provide lower          
              bounds that highlight features of the underlying structure of the              
              problems.
