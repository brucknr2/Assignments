Abstract    :
                   A complex array of both abiotic and biotic factors interact               
              to  structure marine and lacustrine benthic communities.  Many                 
              ecologists consider the role of predators important to the                     
              understanding of how natural communities work.  Stream                         
              ecologists, however, do not agree on the importance of predation               
              to stream communities.  Some studies find direct and indirect                  
              effects if predators, while others find no effects at all.  The                
              disagreement may arise because of differences in the flow regimes              
              of the streams and habitats studied by different researchers.                  
                   This study focuses on temporal variation in the importance                
              of fish predation to stream benthic community structure and how                
              spates and isolation of stream pools interact with predation.                  
              Mesocosms and in situ manipulative experiments will be used to                 
              experimentally test the importance of fish predation in streams                
              during different seasons.  The major objectives are 1. to measure              
              seasonal changes in the effects of predatory fish on benthic                   
              communities; and 2. to calculate the importance of predation                   
              relative to spates in determining community structure throughout               
              a year.  These data will help further our understanding of the                 
              importance of top predators in streams.
