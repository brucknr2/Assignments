Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The award is for the Research in Undergraduate Institutions               
              Program.  The proposed work will examine the structural variations             
              that occur in amorphous silicon nitride and silicon oxynitride                 
              films with varying levels of electrical and/or thermal stimulation.            
              Such structural changes change the physical, chemical and                      
              electrical characteristics of semiconductor devices, including the             
              electrical and chemical stability, threshold voltage and radiation             
              hardness.  If techniques can be developed for reducing the                     
              structural changes in silicon nitride and oxynitride films, the                
              reliability and life of semiconductor devices may be significantly             
              improved.  In addition, the proposed research will provide                     
              opportunities for undergraduate students to develop critical skills            
              in problem solving in the area of solid state technology and to                
              encourage them to pursue graduate degrees.                                     
                   Superplastic forming is used to shape high performance alloys             
              in aerospace applications and will find increased use in its                   
              application to the forming of titanium aluminides and other, "next             
              generation" aerospace materials.  Better understanding of the                  
              behavior of materials during superplastic forming will allow the               
              fabrication of high performance parts at lower cost and with higher            
              reliability.
