Abstract    :
                   An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change              
              Research Program (Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth                     
              Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                     
              environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                   
              Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                    
              Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                
              initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                
              of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                 
              properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                
              geospace model with predictive capability.                                     
                   The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                            
              magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                  
              connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                  
              ionosphere.  The goal of this research is to develop a model of                
              the electron and Ion distribution functions in regions of open                 
              magnetic field lines within the magnetophere.  In essence, the                 
              model will provide a steady-state zeroth - order velocity space                
              mapping of the magnetosphere subject to the constraints of                     
              conservation of magnetic moment, energy and phase-space density                
              along a particle path combined with the time-of-flight (velocity               
              filter) effect.
