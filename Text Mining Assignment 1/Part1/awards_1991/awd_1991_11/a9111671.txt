Abstract    :
              The problem addressed in this project is that of fitting a smoothing           
              or interpolating surface to data values associated with scattered              
              points in the plane.  The surface function provides a visual                   
              impression of the data, thus enabling its efficient evaluation.  It            
              also enables the computation of integrals and values or derivatives at         
              arbitrary points.  Surface fitting methods are useful in almost every          
              field of scientific inquiry, and are particularly important in                 
              meteorology, geology, geophysics, geography, and engineering design.           
              Criteria for judging the value of a data fitting method include                
              faithfulness to the data, a pleasing appearance of the fitting                 
              function, computational efficiency, storage efficiency, user-                  
              convenience, and user-control of parameters which define the fitting           
              function.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed research is to produce a surface fitting         
              method and software package.  The software is to be placed in the              
              public domain and distributed to the scientific community through the          
              ACM Algorithms Distribution Service.
