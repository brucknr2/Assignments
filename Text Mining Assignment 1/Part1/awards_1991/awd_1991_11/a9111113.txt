Abstract    :
                   This award will support the travel costs of U.S. scientists               
              to travel to Weilburg, Germany to participate in the Workshop on               
              Numerical Modeling of Lithospheric and Mantle Dynamics.  The mantle            
              dynamics component of this workshop is part of a series                        
              specifically aimed at detailed assessment of numerical techniques              
              in simulating mantle dynamics.  For the first time this group is               
              being expanded to include scientists involved in the numerical                 
              simulation of lithospheric processes.
