Abstract    :
              This award will supplement the programing effort of an ongoing                 
              project.  The project is to develop a schema for computer                      
              representation and reduction of data commonly involved in                      
              chromosome mapping projects including genetic linkage,                         
              restriction fragment, and ordered clone techniques.  The                       
              objectives include making such a schema the basis of a standard                
              data exchange format.  The exchange of data between researchers                
              would be facilitated and the submission of reduced data to                     
              central institutions would be easier.  The reviewers believe this              
              to be important work and will make a valuable contribution to the              
              field.  They are recommending approval.
