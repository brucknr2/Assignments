Abstract    :
              The broad objective of this research is to provide a better                    
              understanding of the combustion process in self-sustaining                     
              reactions through investigations of the temperature profiles                   
              in the combustion zone.  The nature of the combustion process                  
              dictates the width of the combustion zone, rate of heat                        
              generation, and the combustion temperature of the process.                     
              The CO2 laser to be purchased with this equipment grant will                   
              allow the ignition process to be more carefully controlled.                    
                                                                                             
              The underlying motivation for most of the research in this                     
              field is the potential use of combustion to synthesize new or                  
              superior materials.  The process must be well understood and                   
              its parameters clearly delineated in order for its application                 
              to be compatible with the new trends to produce on a large                     
              scale specially tailored materials.
