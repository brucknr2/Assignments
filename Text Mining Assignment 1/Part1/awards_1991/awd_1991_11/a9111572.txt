Abstract    :
                   Luskin, James and Kinderlehrer will do research in                        
              mathematics and computations with reference to microstructures in              
              crystals, dynamics of phase transitions, molecular forces and                  
              surface energy magnetostriction, and liquid crystal fluid flow.                
                   The growing alliance of nonlinear theory and analysis with                
              scientific computation, since the early 1980's, has led to                     
              significant advances in our understanding of modern materials                  
              like shape-memory alloys, ferroelectrics, and highly                           
              magnetostrictive alloys.  Chief among these are new ways of                    
              understanding defects and microstructure with emphasis on how                  
              they arise and deform.  A consequence is the ability to predict                
              detailed behavior at the microscopic level as will as macroscopic              
              properties.  This may provide a strategy for designing materials               
              or devices to optimize desired electromechanical effects.
