Abstract    :
              This project will apply Levi's knowledge acquisition model to                  
              estimation and identification. The resulting epistemic utility                 
              estimators will have the following characteristics: (a) estimates              
              will consist of all values that are seriously possible given the               
              data, available a priori information, and the decision agent's                 
              values and goals, and, (b), the willingness to risk error in return            
              for information is explicitly specified.
