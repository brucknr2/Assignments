Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research planning grant is to lay the               
              groundwork for a research effort that will develop and integrate               
              methods and tools to provide computer assistance for designing                 
              single-chip microprocessors and multi-chip based computers.  The               
              focus of this work will be at the architectural design level.                  
                   Most computer-aided design (CAD) research has not addressed               
              the initial formal specification phase of the design process.  A               
              correct and complete functional specification is necessary before              
              these computer-aided design tools are useful.  The results of this             
              work will lead to a proposal for a global system for computer                  
              architecture design and performance estimation.
