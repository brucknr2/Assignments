Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at experimental and theoretical-simulation               
              studies of molecular and excitation transport, interactions,                   
              dynamics and chemical reaction in small, confined material systems.            
              Understanding the kinetics of crystallation, phase transitions,                
              solid state reactions, and exitonic transformations in                         
              nanostructures will be emphasized.  The controlled formation of                
              molecular wires or crystalline "dots" is relevant to the search for            
              better optical memories and chips, nanolithography, and                        
              supersensitive molecular detectors.
