Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Research Planning grant will free Dr. Linda S. Ross from                  
              teaching in order for her to obtain data necessary for                         
              establishing an independent research program.  The issue of the                
              contributions played by information obtained from intrinsic                    
              genetic information and from the environment in determining cell               
              fate will be studied by following the differentiation of                       
              identified cells in the visual cortex of the normal and                        
              experimentally manipulated, transparent zebrafish embryo.  These               
              studies will form a foundation for future studies of dynamic                   
              analyses of cellular interactions and lineage relationships in                 
              the developing visual system.
