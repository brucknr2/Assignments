Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) has now completed 18 months of                
              drilling and coring operations in the Indian Ocean. The results                
              of ODP drilling can now be integrated with data from earlier Deep              
              Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) drilling in the region and with new                
              plate tectonic reconstructions. This award will support US                     
              participation in such a synthesis project which has recently been              
              funded in Great Britain. The basic objective of this study is to               
              document the sedimentary and biotic response to tectonic,                      
              climatic and oceanographic changes which occurred at four                      
              critical time intervals in the Cenozoic (middle Eocene,                        
              Eocene/Oligocene, middle Miocene, and Miocene/Pliocene). Dr.                   
              Davies role in this study is to produce a consistent data base of              
              sediment characteristics for all Indian Ocean sites, preparation               
              of maps of sediment properties during the critical time periods,               
              and to determine sedimentation rates and mass balances for the                 
              basins of the Indian Ocean.//
