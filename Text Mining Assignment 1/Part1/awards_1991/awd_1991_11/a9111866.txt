Abstract    :
              New types of semiconductor device structures based                             
              on the quantitative analogies between ballistic                                
              (collisionless) transport in semiconductors and                                
              electromagnetic propagation in dielectrics are being                           
              investigated.  With electron energies such that                                
              propagation is above all conduction band edges (as                             
              opposed to below the barrier tunneling), these                                 
              structures exhibit electron wave optical effects                               
              including reflection, refraction, diffraction, and                             
              interference.  Theoretical and experimental                                    
              research is being conducted on the resulting                                   
              electron waveguides, negative resistance devices,                              
              tunable filters, tunable emitters, interference                                
              diodes, and interference transistors for future                                
              integrated circuits of higher speeds and higher                                
              levels of integration.
