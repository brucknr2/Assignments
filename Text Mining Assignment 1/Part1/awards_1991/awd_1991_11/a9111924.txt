Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project studies models where variations in the markup of                  
              price over marginal cost is a central component of the                         
              explanation of business cycles.  The theoretical rigor and the                 
              empirical validity of imperfect competition models of business                 
              cycles will be determined.  This research should provide valuable              
              insights into the relationship between macroeconomic activity and              
              microeconomic industry structure.                                              
                                                                                             
              More specifically, time series for markup variation will be                    
              constructed for both the private sector as a whole and for 4-                  
              digit manufacturing industries.  Various procedures are proposed               
              to check the plausibility of the theoretical models.  For                      
              instance, if markup variations as a result of imperfect                        
              competition explain business cycles, such markup variation should              
              be more pronounced in relatively concentrated sectors.  In                     
              addition, different models of markup variation have different                  
              implications for how the current level of sales and the expected               
              future level of profits affect markups.  Both aggregate and                    
              disaggregated data contain information about the way these                     
              variables affect markups.  The extent to which aggregate demand                
              influences output through the variables that determine markups in              
              the models (current sales and the present value of future                      
              profitability) will also be ascertained.  Finally, the output                  
              volatility that changes in these variables induce through changes              
              in the markup will be measured.
