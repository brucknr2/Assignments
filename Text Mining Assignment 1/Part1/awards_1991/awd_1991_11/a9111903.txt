Abstract    :
              This research deals with the chemistry of alpha-                               
              hydroxymethylacrylate (HMA) ester synthesis, polymerization, and               
              characterization.  Extension and exploration of the rich chemistry             
              of various alkyl esters (RHMAs) will make available polymerizable              
              derivatives possessing halide, ester, ether, silyl ether, urethane,            
              and amine groups.  Many of these will also possess siloxane,                   
              hydrocarbon, and fluorocarbon residues.  Reactive oligomers with               
              internal and terminal groups will be synthesized using a newly-                
              discovered ether-forming reaction of the RHMA alcohol groups.  Also            
              available will be monomers with supernucleophilic catalyst groups,             
              and monomers capable of forming polymerizable micelles, vesicles,              
              monolayers, and liquid crystalline states.  Cyclopolymerization of             
              the ether dimers generates pyran-containing polymers with pendent              
              carboxylate groups with potential anticancer and antiviral                     
              activity.  Formation of reactive halides and isocyanates of the                
              RHMA's extends the functional capability of the monomers and                   
              polymers to many other derivatives.  Anionic and group transfer                
              polymerizations of ethers and silyl ethers will allow isotactic and            
              controlled MW polymer formation.  Studies will also deal with                  
              intramolecular 6-membered ring hydrogen bond effects on polymer                
              solubility and physical properties, steric inhibition of                       
              polymerization by a-methyl substituents, and use of the t-butyl                
              effect to form high molecular weight cyclopolymers.
