Abstract    :
                   This action will provide funds for three investigators at                 
              the University of Illinois at Chicago to continue their                        
              investigations in elementary particle physics.  They have been                 
              performing, with other collaborators, a comprehensive study of                 
              the scattering of muons from protons and various heavier nuclear               
              targets.  The experiment, E665 in progress at Fermilab, will                   
              result in the study of the constituents of the elementary                      
              particles.  Other NSF grantees are among the collaborators.                    
                   Toward the end of the grant period, new activities with                   
              colliding beams will be started.  The investigators are working                
              on design studies for the upgrade of the D0 particle detector at               
              the Fermilab Tevatron collider and for the MARS particle                       
              detector under consideration at the Brookhaven Relativistic                    
              Heavy Ion  Collider.
