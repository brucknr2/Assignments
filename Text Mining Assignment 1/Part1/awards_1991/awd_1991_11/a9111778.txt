Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, seeks to expand                
              the use of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to elucidate the                    
              handedness or chirality of two important types of molecules:                   
              cyclodextrins (molecules with cavities that can selectively                    
              sequester other molecules of specific size and shape) and                      
              3,5-dinitrobenzoylamino acid esters (derivatives of amino acids                
              useful in separating molecules of different chirality).                        
              Lanthanide ions will be bound to chiral species.  Proximity of                 
              lanthanides to probed molecules shifts their magnetic resonance                
              spectra; quantification of the shifts will lead to the methods                 
              for assigning chirality.                                                       
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, seeks to expand                
              the use of lanthanide NMR shift reagents for probing chirality.                
              Both cyclodextrins and 3,5-dinitrobenzoylamino aicd esters will                
              be studied with complexed or covalently bound lanthanides as                   
              paramagnetic shift species.  Assignment of absolute                            
              configuration and study of chiral interactions are primary                     
              goals of this research.
