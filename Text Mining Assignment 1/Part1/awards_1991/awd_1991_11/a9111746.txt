Abstract    :
              An upgraded Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) will be used in                    
              studies of deposition processes in optical fiber                               
              manufacturing, vortex dynamics in rectangular combustors,                      
              flame structure for combustion chemistry studies, and                          
              atomization processes in liquid rocket motors.  The upgraded                   
              instrument will be capable of measuring velocity from zero to                  
              +- 200 m/sec under a variety of conditions.  For the                           
              deposition study, particle velocities will be measured under                   
              the influence of electric field enhanced deposition conditions                 
              for comparison with modeling calculations.  In the asymmetric                  
              combustor study, velocity distributions will be measured in a                  
              rectangular dump combustor with acoustic forcing.  In the                      
              combustion chemistry studies, velocities normal to the test                    
              burner will be measured to aid in determining kinetic                          
              behavior.  In the atomization study, liquid drop size and                      
              velocity distributions under oscillationing flow conditions                    
              will be measured.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Acquisition of the upgraded equipment will lead to a more                      
              quantitative assessment of a variety of combustion process,                    
              and should positively impact the optical fiber, jet engine,                    
              and rocket motor industries.
