Abstract    :
              This SGER project aims to prepare and derivatize rigid carbon                  
              clusters known as "Fullerenes."  These new compounds will be hollow            
              molecular spheres consisting of pi-conjugated carbon atoms attached            
              to various functional groups and a large variety of elements to                
              yield novel molecular solids.  Due to the high symmetry, electronic            
              character and structural design of these clusters, it is expected              
              that these molecular solid state materials will exhibit                        
              unprecedented condensed matter properties.
