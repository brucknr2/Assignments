Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research employs Kelvin probes to study the corrosion behavior            
              of metallic surfaces.  The investigators are constructing a                    
              potentiostat/galvanostat system using the Kelvin vibrator as a                 
              contactless reference electrode.  The Kelvin probe is a sensor for             
              determining the corrosion potential of materials exposed to thin               
              film electrolytes.  This system is used for the measurement of the             
              corrosion potential and corrosion current versus time of                       
              homogeneous and of galvanically coupled metals under very thin                 
              electrolyte layers and humidity films.  The devise is also used to             
              determine effects of substrate-induced heterogeneities and defects             
              on the semiconducting properties of anodically grown titanium                  
              dioxide.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              This research is making significant strides in new understanding of            
              atmospheric corrosion.  The Kelvin probe permits electrochemical               
              measurements through precisely controlled electrolyte films within             
              specific pollutant atmospheres.
