Abstract    :
              This award supports a delegation of chemists from U.S.                         
              universities to Czechoslovakia to become acquainted with                       
              research activities in chemistry in Czechoslovak universities                  
              and research institutes.  The U.S. delegation will identify                    
              areas of mutual research interest which may become the focus                   
              for future cooperation.  The delegation will gain first hand                   
              experience about the status of chemistry in Czechoslovakia.                    
              Finally, the personal contacts established during this visit                   
              will lead to closer cooperation between U.S. and Czechoslovak                  
              chemists.  This is a research planning grant which involves a                  
              report to the Foundation shortly after completion of the trip.                 
              The report will be widely circulated to other government                       
              agencies as a means to expedite interactions between U.S. and                  
              Czechoslovak chemists.
