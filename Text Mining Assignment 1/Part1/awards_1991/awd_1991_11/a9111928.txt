Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will study the                    
              rate of association between chiral molecules and both chiral                   
              and achiral hosts using "lifetime-resolved fluorescence-                       
              detected circular dichroism" (LRFDCD), a method which can                      
              monitor the change in light polarization during a reaction.                    
              Light polarization and fluorescence lifetime can both be                       
              related to the speed and extent of reaction. Among the systems                 
              to be characterized are antibody-antigen interactions in                       
              immunochemical methods of analysis, solubilization of molecules                
              in organized media, and interactions between chiral solutes and                
              chromatographic phases in enantiomeric separations.

              This research is concerned with the interactions of guest                      
              molecules with the molecular components of host cavities.  Of                  
              particular interest are the effects of the shapes of the guests                
              and of the host cavities on these interactions. Chiral and                     
              achiral hosts and chiral and achiral guests will be studied                    
              using a new technique called "time-resolved                                    
              fluorescence-detected circular dichroism."  The results will be                
              applicable to chromatomatographic separations of chiral                        
              molecules and to a better understanding of the kinetics of                     
              biochemical reactions and of antibody-antigen interactions.
