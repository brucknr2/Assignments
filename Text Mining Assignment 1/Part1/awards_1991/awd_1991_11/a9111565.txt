Abstract    :
              A modification is proposed that should, for a very large                       
              class of processes, guarantee asymptotic output model                          
              following for a very easily implementable direct                               
              adaptive control algorithm that can be applied to                              
              multiple input multiple output systems.  This algorithm                        
              in order to satisfy a positive real constraint, has had to                     
              incorporate supplementary feedforward dynamics, thus                           
              resulting in stability but not perfect asymptotic tracking.                    
              The new modification by incorporating part of the                              
              feedforward dynamics into the model is such that                               
              perfect tracking of the augmented plant and model                              
              outputs implies perfect tracking of the original outputs.                      
              The proposed research involves the stability proof of                          
              the new modified algorithm, a study of procedures for                          
              designing robust feedforward dynamics, and an                                  
              experimental validation study.
