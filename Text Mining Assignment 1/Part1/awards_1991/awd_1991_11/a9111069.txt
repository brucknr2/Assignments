Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to study from a theoretical and                 
              empirical perspective how companies structure their debt.  For                 
              example, what determines whether companies borrow from banks or                
              issue public debt; whether companies issue secured or unsecured                
              loans; and whether they borrow short or long term.  This study is              
              important because it help us better understand the effects of                  
              financial regulation, financial distress, and macroeconomic                    
              fluctuations.  There are three topics to the project, two of which             
              are empirical.  The first will analyze the recent shift in Japan               
              away from bank financing toward public debt financing using a                  
              detailed firm-level database of Japanese companies.  The second                
              part will develop a firm-level U.S. corporate debt structure and               
              analyze both how debt is determined and how debt structure affects             
              the ability of firms to respond to macroeconomic and industry                  
              fluctuations.  The third topic is a theoretical analysis which                 
              involves constructing a model that incorporates important aspects              
              of debt structure, such as the choice of how many creditors to                 
              borrow from and the assignment of security interests.
