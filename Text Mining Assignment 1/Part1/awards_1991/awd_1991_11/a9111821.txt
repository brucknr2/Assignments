Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for a workshop to assess the current                        
              state of knowledge and to identify the research needs                          
              in the topic of voltage phenomena.  The topic of                               
              voltage phenomena refers to the dynamic behavior of                            
              network voltages.  The objectives of this workshop are                         
              to identify the highest priority research areas within                         
              this topic and to stimulate work in those areas.
