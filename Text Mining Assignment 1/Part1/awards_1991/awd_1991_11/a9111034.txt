Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to investigate the                            
              configurational transport processes that underline site-                       
              specific reaction with soluble and immobilized enzymes, via                    
              theoretical, numerical and experimental techniques.  The                       
              specific goals are:                                                            
                                                                                             
              (1)    to further the understanding of confined transitional,                  
                                                                                             
                     rotational and conformational diffusion of                              
              macromolecular                                                                 
                     substrates in fine pores;                                               
              (2)    to develop a predictive theory describing the interplay                 
                                                                                             
                     between these configurational modes of transport and                    
                     site-specific binding steps fundamental to enzymatic                    
                     reactions;                                                              
              (3)    to work the detailed diffusion-reactions theory evolved                 
                                                                                             
                     into a comprehensive computer-aided methodology for                     
                     optimization of conversion rates with respect to                        
              structural                                                                     
                     and physicochemical support properties;                                 
              (4)    to aid the development of industrial applications of                    
                     immobilized enzymes via detailed study of large-                        
                     substrates binding and other phenomena of practical                     
                     relevance; and                                                          
              (5)    to fabricate porous carriers with tailored                              
              microstructures                                                                
                     and test them experimentally.                                           
                                                                                             
              This work will furnish an experimentally-supported fundamental                 
                                                                                             
              transport framework for analyzing site-specific diffusion-                     
              reaction processes.  Its practical value derives from its                      
              quantification of poorly understood pore-scale phenomena that                  
                                                                                             
              mask intrinsic kinetics, for which improved understanding will
