Abstract    :
              Professor Hawkins is continuing his study of the origins of the                
              theory of the structure and representation of semisimple Lie                   
              algebras.  This theory is an important component of contemporary               
              mathematics, with many applications to other areas of mathematics              
              and physics.  A study of its historical development is of                      
              additional historical interest, however, because the historical                
              roots of the theory are entwined with many strands of 19th and                 
              early 20th century mathematics, involving the leading mathematical             
              schools of the period.  By considering together and in some detail             
              the complex web of mathematicians and mathematical ideas that                  
              combined to produce the theory, a more realistic portrait of the               
              development of mathematics should emerge.  That is, one that does              
              justice to the fact that mathematics grows in large part through               
              the cross fertilization of diverse mathematical ideas, theories and            
              perspectives originating from many sources and that the                        
              significance of a mathematical problem or theory often changes with            
              time and circumstances.  It also provides a broad-based case study             
              of the growth of mathematical knowledge that should benefit                    
              philosophers of mathematics who utilize history in their                       
              philosophical studies of the nature of mathematics.
