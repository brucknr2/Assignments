Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  During the 1980s, the majority of sub-Saharan African nations             
              were engulfed in an economic crisis.  Growth in poverty and                    
              unemployment escalated with the greatest increases occurring among             
              women heading households.  A small, strong informal sector might               
              assist in alleviating these problems.  This Minority Research                  
              Initiation Planning Grant examines entrepreneurship in small and               
              informal sector firms in two cities in Zimbabwe seeking to identify            
              the personal attributes of those who begin such firms, their                   
              educational and employment histories, the successes and problems               
              they have encountered in operating their businesses, and the                   
              existence of governmental or nongovernmental agencies to support               
              their endeavors to enhance our understanding of the composition,               
              contributions and articulation of the informal sector to formal                
              activities and to the larger national and global economies.  In-               
              depth interviews with entrepreneurs who began small and informal               
              businesses in these cities and with civil serves and others                    
              involved in governmental and nongovernmental agencies providing                
              support for these firms will be conducted and analyzed.                        
                                                                                             
                   This preliminary research will provide valuable information               
              about the role the informal sector might play in generating                    
              employment, particularly for women, in Sub-Saharan Africa.  This               
              project also provides an excellent opportunity for a promising                 
              young scholar to lay the foundation for more extensive research on             
              gender and entrepreneurship.
