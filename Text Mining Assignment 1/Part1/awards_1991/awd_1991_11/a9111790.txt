Abstract    :
              This study analyzes what accounts for offending careers from                   
              adolescence to young adulthood.  The research takes advantage of               
              a longitudinal data base collected from a sample of approximately              
              500 adolescent males who were initially interviewed in 1982-83 when            
              their ages ranged from 11 to 17 and reinterviewed in 1990-91 when              
              they were ages 19 to 25.  Sampling for the study was carried out               
              in two stages:  First, 12 urban neighborhoods representing a                   
              crossed array in terms of levels of family disorganization,                    
              neighborhood, social rank, and predominant race group (black or                
              white) were selected.  In the second stage, households in each of              
              the areas were listed and screened.  Eligible households were then             
              grouped into single vs. two-parent households and stratified random            
              samples were drawn.  The purpose of this study is to (1) identify              
              contextual and individual-level risk factors associated with                   
              patterns of onset and suspension of offending; (2) delineate the               
              relationship among type of community context, characteristics of               
              interpersonal networks, and offending behavior in young adulthood;             
              and (3) develop a model of change and stability in offending which             
              incorporates individual level risk factors and the conditional                 
              effects of social context.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Substantively, the research builds on extant longitudinal studies              
              in postulating the effects of early behavior and of later role                 
              transitions on the dynamics of change over time.  Distinctively,               
              it also examines the conditional effects of macrosocial factors on             
              these individual-level processes.  The importance of cross-level               
              theorizing and related empirical study cannot be overemphasized.               
              Linking neighborhood characteristics and individual factors is a               
              long overdue research strategy in this arena of work.   By focusing            
              specifically on these macro-micro linkages, this study promises to             
              advance our most basic understandings about delinquency and crime.
