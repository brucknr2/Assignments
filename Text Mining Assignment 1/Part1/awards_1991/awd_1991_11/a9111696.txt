Abstract    :
              The Cliometric Conference series continues to serve as an important            
              means for encouraging research in economic history and as forum for            
              disseminating new methods, findings, and interpretations among                 
              historians as well as economists.  A special effort is made to                 
              include the work of graduate students and assistant professors                 
              representing a broad range of specialties, but with increasing                 
              emphasis on twentieth century problems.  The scientific results of             
              the cliometric history movement have been impressive and promise               
              to be equally important in the years ahead.  The next meetings are             
              scheduled to be held in May 1992 and May 1993 at  Miami University             
              and the University of Illinois, respectively.
