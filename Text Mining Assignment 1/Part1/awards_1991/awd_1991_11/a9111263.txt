Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed research is to develop a parallel                
              multifrontal method for LU factorization of sparse unsymmetric                 
              matrices that takes full advantage of dense matrix kernels while               
              maintaining a purely unsymmetric pattern.  The resulting                       
              algorithm will have the potential for high performance on large,               
              sparse matrices with unsymmetric pattern.  The algorithm will be               
              applicable to the many problems in science and engineering that                
              require the numerical solution of sparse unsymmetric systems of                
              linear equations.
