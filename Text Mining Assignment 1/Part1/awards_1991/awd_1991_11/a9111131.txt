Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The award is for a planning grant funded under the Minority                    
              Research Initiation Program.  The purpose of a planning grant is to            
              provide financial support for an investigator to prepare a                     
              competitive research proposal.  This planning grant will enable the            
              investigator to prepare a research proposal which focuses on                   
              analyzing the effects of mergers and buy outs on wages in various              
              industries.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              As a result of less restrictive antitrust policy, and increased                
              deregulation, the frequency and size of mergers rose significantly             
              during the 1980's.  There is concern that employment relations will            
              be altered by this structural change in product markets.  Union                
              leaders, for example, content that the wave of corporate mergers in            
              the 1980's disproportionately harmed union members.  Mergers                   
              occasionally resulted in the new corporation repudiating existing              
              unions or seeking major concessions.                                           
              This raises the possibility that one reason for mergers is to                  
              capture union rents.  This proposed research will attempt to                   
              explain the pattern of mergers using individual worker data.
