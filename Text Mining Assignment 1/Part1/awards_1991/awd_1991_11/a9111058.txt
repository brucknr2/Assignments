Abstract    :
              Since about 1985, extremely efficient and                                      
              nonconservative methods have been developed for the                            
              analysis of robust stability of control systems subject to                     
              parameter variations.  However, there are no synthesis                         
              procedures available at all.  On the other hand,                               
              H-infinity control theory has a well-developed synthesis                       
              procedure.  This theory, however, is highly conservative                       
              when applied to the parametric stability problem.  In                          
              this proposal it is intended to develop synthesis                              
              procedures for control problems containing parameter                           
              uncertainty.  A promising opening is given by recent                           
              results (obtained by the PI's) proving that the extremal                       
              stability margins (including H-infinity margins) occur                         
              on certain manifolds derived from Kharitonov's                                 
              theorem.  This link suggests that H-infinity (and other                        
              classical synthesis methods) might be intelligently                            
              tailored to give nonconservative synthesis procedures                          
              for parameter variation problems.  This will form the                          
              main area of our research.  It is expected that the                            
              results of this research project to have an impact on                          
              the analysis and design of control systems arising in                          
              many applications.
