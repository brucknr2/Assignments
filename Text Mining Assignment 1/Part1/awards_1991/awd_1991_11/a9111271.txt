Abstract    :
              Supporting historical references is an important problem in                    
              several areas of computer science and engineering. The                         
              significance of the database versioning problem (i.e., keeping                 
              and accessing old versions) has been particularly mentioned in                 
              recent advances in the database community. In the rapidly growing              
              area of object oriented programming, historical references enable              
              programmers to create new objects based on previous object                     
              versions. Traditional approaches to supporting historical                      
              references require either large space or long reconstruction                   
              times, making the extensive use of such references prohibitive.                
              This project provides efficient support of historical references,              
              i.e., fast reconstruction to any past state without sacrificing a              
              large amount of storage space. New, optimal ways are investigated              
              to compress temporal data, while still providing practically                   
              random access to any past reference on these data. Moreover, the               
              problems of distributing the history, keeping the history of a                 
              system that evolves like a graph, keeping histories in limited                 
              space and other general historical queries (not indexed by time                
              but instead using historical correlation) are analyzed. The                    
              results of this project will greatly impact the use of the                     
              recorded past history for different programmers or database                    
              users. Other applications of these results to be considered,                   
              include network management tools, animation storing and archiving              
              the UNIX directory system.
