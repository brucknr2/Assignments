Abstract    :
                   One objective of population biology is to understand how                  
              the environment leads to differences among species; another is to              
              explore the behavioral and physiological mechanisms that control               
              life history traits of individual species.  This research is                   
              designed to contribute to this basic knowledge by studying how                 
              hormones shape and direct the life of a small bird, the dark-eyed              
              junco.  The focus is on males and the hormone testosterone, which              
              is known to have numerous effects on animal behavior, physiology,              
              and morphology (shape and form).  These effects include a                      
              suppressive effect of testosterone on male parental behavior and               
              a stimulatory effect on behavior related to mate attraction, e.g.              
              singing.  Testosterone can also decrease resistance to disease.                
              By manipulating the amount of testosterone in the blood and                    
              comparing the behavior and physiology of the treated birds to                  
              that of untreated, control birds, changes induced will be                      
              examined and related to correlates of fitness, such as ability                 
              to sire offspring, life span, and survival of offspring.  The                  
              birds will be studied in the field where their survival and                    
              success in producing offspring can be monitored.  By tracking the              
              fates of animals whose physiology and behavior deviates from the               
              normative state, the research will lead to a more fundamental                  
              understanding of how hormonal systems evolve and what balance of               
              selective factors and organismal responses keeps a particular                  
              animal species "on track" over evolutionary time.
