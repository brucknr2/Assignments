Abstract    :
              The use of two dimensional finite                                              
              element electromagnetic models to                                              
              simulate the electrical                                                        
              characteristic of both scattering                                              
              and guided wave structures has                                                 
              become commonplace due to the                                                  
              development of powerful and cheap                                              
              computers.  Unfortunately, many                                                
              geometries cannot be accurately                                                
              modeled in two dimensions.  The                                                
              step from two the three dimensions                                             
              is both computationally expensive                                              
              and analytically complex.  A                                                   
              traditional finite element                                                     
              formulation results in spurious                                                
              solutions in three dimensions.  In                                             
              addition, the vector nature of the                                             
              fields makes the task of grid                                                  
              truncation very difficult.  The                                                
              "bymoment" method has shown itself                                             
              to be an efficient technique for                                               
              grid truncation in a two

              solution.  It is believed that many                                            
              of its advantages can be translated                                            
              to three dimensions.  In this                                                  
              project the "bymoment" method will                                             
              be extended to solve the problem of                                            
              electromagnetic scattering from                                                
              three dimensional complex objects.                                             
              The development of such a technique                                            
              will provide solutions for many                                                
              problems which are currently solved                                            
              by approximate techniques.  In                                                 
              addition, the development of a                                                 
              three dimensional scheme can lead                                              
              to applications for guided wave                                                
              structures.
