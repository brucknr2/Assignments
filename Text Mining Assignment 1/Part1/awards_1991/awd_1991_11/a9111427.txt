Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The ability to measure concentrations of metabolic gases, such as              
              CO2 CH4, O2, H2 and others, can provide insights into                          
              biogeochemical processes associated with soils or sediments.                   
              Measurement of these metabolic gases with high resolution is                   
              limited both by the difficulty of sampling porewaters from                     
              sediments and by disturbances caused by porewater sampling.  This              
              research project will measure volatile gases in situ using a                   
              battery-operated portable mass spectrometer and a small semi-                  
              permeable probe. The basic portable mass spectrometer has already              
              been developed.  The present research will focus on development                
              of a suitable probe that can be directly inserted into sediments,              
              as well as augmentation of the mass spectrometer itself.  The                  
              system will be tested in peatland sediments where distributions                
              and gradients of methane, oxygen, carbon dioxide are important                 
              for understanding the mechanisms of trace gas exchange with the                
              atmosphere.  The proposed system, because it is based on a mass                
              spectrometer, also has the potential to support in  situ stable                
              isotope enrichment studies.
