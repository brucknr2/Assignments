Abstract    :
                   Significant future improvements of the detection sensitivity              
              of ultralow temperature resonant mass detectors of gravitational               
              radiation may be achieved by refined detector material selection.              
              This award in experimental gravitational physics will allow                    
              Professor Duffy to continue his evaluation of material Q-values                
              and thermal properties.                                                        
                   This research will emphasize studies of the mechanical                    
              quality factor (Q) vs. temperature from 50 mK to 300K of selected              
              polycrystalline technical materials.  The focus of the l kHz                   
              studies will be on the significant temperature region from 50 mK               
              to 1 K, where there is a paucity of data.  Q-values will be                    
              determined from the vibration decay of a mechanical resonator                  
              mounted in the vacuum chamber of a dilution refrigerator                       
              cryostat.  Resonators will be fabricated from high-purity                      
              refractory metals and ceramic materials, which exhibit large                   
              cross-sections for gravity-wave detection by resonant bar                      
              antennas.  Detailed annealing procedures needed to achieve the                 
              highest cryogenic Qs will be developed.  Grain size and hardness               
              will be evaluated.  Ultralow temperature specific heat capacity                
              and thermal conductivity studies will be carried out on selected               
              materials.  In addition to supporting gravity wave antenna                     
              development, the results should contribute to the fundamental                  
              understanding of acoustic loss mechanisms at ultralow                          
              temperatures.
