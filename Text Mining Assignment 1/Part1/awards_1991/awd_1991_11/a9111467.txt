Abstract    :
              A low-temperature heat-flux calorimeter is acquire to study                    
              the thermodynamic properties of reactive intermediates on                      
              solid catalytic surfaces.  The initial use of the instrument                   
              will be in studies of the cracking of isobutane, the synthesis                 
              of aliphatic amines, the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of                   
              olefins, and the reactions of hydrocarbons on platinum in                      
              zeolite-L.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The efforts supported by this equipment have significant                       
              implications for the petroleum, drug, agricultural chemical,                   
              and specialty chemical industries.
