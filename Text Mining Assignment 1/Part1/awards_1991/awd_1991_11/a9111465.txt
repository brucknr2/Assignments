Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Rosenberg is continuing his exploration of the causes of                   
              neoclassical economics' predictive weakness and is examining the               
              cognitive status of the discipline's theories in the light of this             
              explanation of their weakness.  The source of this weakness, Dr.               
              Rosenberg argues, is in the intentional psychological theory which             
              economists at the same time implicitly presume and explicitly                  
              rejects as irrelevant to their aims and methods.  In this                      
              continuing research, he is examining more thoroughly two sets of               
              issues hitherto unexamined by philosophers of economics:  the role             
              of innovations in undermining prediction, and the nature of                    
              information as an economic variable.
