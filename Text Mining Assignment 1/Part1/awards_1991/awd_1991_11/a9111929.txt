Abstract    :
                   An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change              
              Research Program (Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth                     
              Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                     
              environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                   
              Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                    
              Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                
              initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                
              of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                 
              properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                
              geospace model with predictive capability.                                     
                   The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                            
              magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                  
              connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                  
              ionosphere.  This grant requests support to operate an induction               
              coil magnetometer at Frobisher Bay, Canada sensitive to magnetic               
              pulsations  having periods between 1000 sec. and 0.1/sec.                      
              Pulsations in this frequency range could be an important                       
              component of the GEM mapping program since they present a                      
              possible opportunity to sample superthermal and energetic ion                  
              populations in their generation region
