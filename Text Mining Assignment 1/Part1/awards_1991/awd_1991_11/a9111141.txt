Abstract    :
              The ability of ceramic materials to withstand high temperature and             
              hostile environments offers great prospect for potential major                 
              improvements in the design performance of high temperature                     
              components in chemical processing, power generation and industrial             
              waste recovery applications.  Their use as structural materials,               
              however, has been limited primarily because of their poor fracture             
              toughness and lack of damage tolerance.  Although research in the              
              past has resulted in major advances in the low temperature                     
              toughening of ceramics especially be second phase reinforcements,              
              the majority of these low temperature toughening mechanisms become             
              ineffective at high temperatures.  In this research the fundamental            
              micromechanisms of high temperature subcritical crack growth in                
              three classes of ceramic-matrix composites, chosen to reflect                  
              different primary room temperature toughening mechanisms, namely               
              crack deflection, crack trapping and crack bridging, will be                   
              examined.  The approach will be 1) to develop a viable high                    
              temperature crack growth monitoring technique in semiconducting                
              ceramics, ii) to identify salient mechanisms impeding crack                    
              advances in these composites at high temperatures, iii) to examine             
              the microstructural origins of these mechanisms in terms of the                
              interaction between the crack and the constituents of the                      
              composite, iv) to document the toughening from these mechanisms as             
              a function of the microstructural parameters, and v) to establish              
              physical models describing the microstructural dependence of the               
              toughening mechanism.
