Abstract    :
              This project addresses controller design for nonlinear                         
              electromagnetic levitation devices.  These devices are used in a               
              variety of applications including non-contact bearings,                        
              suspensions, and high speed position actuators.  They are                      
              critical to the performance and efficiency of a broad class of                 
              systems including transportation and robotic systems.  The                     
              dynamic equations of motion for these devices are highly                       
              nonlinear and the open loop system is inherently unstable.  This               
              project focuses on two problems comprising (1) the synthesis of                
              nonadaptive continuous control laws for nonlinear electromagnetic              
              levitation devices, and (2) the design of controllers for the                  
              case where some states must be estimated.  It is expected that                 
              this research will provide more effective methods for controlling              
              electromagnetic levitation devices which must operate at high                  
              speeds and have large air gap variations.
