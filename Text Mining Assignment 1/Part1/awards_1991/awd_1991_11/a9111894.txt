Abstract    :
              The University of Kansas Center for Research, Inc.                             
              will purchase microwave interferometry equipment                               
              under this NSF Engineering Research Equipment                                  
              Grant for use in the Chemical and Petroleum                                    
              Department, which will be dedicated to support                                 
              research in engineering.  The equipment will be used                           
              for several research projects on plasma processes                              
              used in the semiconductor industry including:  (l)                             
              development of a novel technique to measure                                    
              electron concentration measurement using electrical-                           
              impedance analysis, (2) development and testing of                             
              models of electron and ion kinetics in a plasma                                
              discharge, and (3) research on the neutral chemistry                           
              kinetics in plasma reactors.  The overall goal of the                          
              research is to be able to operate and develop plasma                           
              processes better for the future needs of the                                   
              semiconductor industry.
