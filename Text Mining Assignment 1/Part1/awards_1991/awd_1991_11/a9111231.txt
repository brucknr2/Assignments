Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this research is to make it possible to               
              build machine learning systems that robustly improve their                     
              planning performance with experience in complex real-world                     
              domains.  The current machine learning techniques are not                      
              adequate for this purpose because their language of                            
              representation is not expressive enough to capture the knowledge               
              needed to be effective in these domains.  This work will study                 
              the relationship between the language of representation of the                 
              learned knowledge and the computational tradeoffs involved in                  
              learning and planning in that language.  We also propose to                    
              enhance the capabilities of current techniques by developing                   
              learning and planning methods for more expressive                              
              representations.
