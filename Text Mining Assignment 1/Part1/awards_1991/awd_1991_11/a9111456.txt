Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for a grant to establish a                               
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Wireless                   
              Information Networks at Rutgers University.  Wireless information              
              services such as cordless telephone and cellular radio are                     
              technologically in their infancy.  The aim of the research program             
              at the Center is to overcome bottlenecks that restrict the growth              
              and enhancement of wireless networking.  The proposed systems                  
              research projects include; a) multiple access performance                      
              evaluation, b) object oriented systems integration in wireless                 
              networks, c) Dynamic spectrum reuse, d) optimization of the                    
              physical layer, and e) a wireless network testbed.                             
                   The Program Manager recommends a continuing award of $50,000              
              each year for the next five years to Rutgers University for                    
              establishing a Center for Wireless Information Networks.                       
                   Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                  
              and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review            
              the progress of the Center on a number of criteria, including the              
              following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                    
              interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to                 
              which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                 
              robust research program is developing.  If the review is                       
              satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend support of the               
              next period of this continuing grant.
