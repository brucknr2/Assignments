Abstract    :
                   The PI plans to investigate the paleomagnetic and mineral                 
              magnetic character of sediments from a series of lakes in the                  
              Venezuelan Andes.  This research is being undertaken to further                
              define paleoclimatic variation in the region.  The lakes, ranging              
              in altitude from 1000 to 3,500 m, have been sampled and studied by             
              colleagues from U. Mass who have produced a geochemical based                  
              paleoclimatic record for the past 18,000 years.  Secular variation             
              of the lake sediments will be studied using inclination and                    
              relative declination measurements of the magnetic field.  The                  
              carriers of the magnetic signature, as well as their grain size                
              will be investigated in detail on subsamples from preexisting lake             
              cores.  The magnetic data, in conjunction with detailed geochemical            
              and palynological data on the same cores, will provide a                       
              correlation of techniques in paleoclimatology studies, provide for             
              corroboration of previous interpretations, and present new                     
              information on the paleoclimitalogy and paleoenvironment of the                
              northern Andes.
