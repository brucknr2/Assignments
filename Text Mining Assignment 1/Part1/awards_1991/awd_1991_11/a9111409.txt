Abstract    :
                   The reaction of hydrogen atoms with ozone generates hydroxyl              
              radicals (OH) in vibrational levels between v=5 and 9.  This                   
              reaction occurs naturally in the upper region of the mesophere,                
              generating strong infrared flourescence from the vibrationally                 
              excited OH.  In this altitude region, the intensity and spectrum               
              of the emission depend on both the radiative and the collisional               
              properties of the vibrationally excited OH.  Under a previous                  
              grant the PI developed new laser-based methods of measuring the                
              rate constants and relaxation pathways of these highly                         
              vibrationally excited radicals.  In the work supported by this                 
              grant the new technique will be applied to determining OH rate                 
              constants that are at atmospheric importance and directly                      
              applicable to the conditions encountered by the excited OH in the              
              mesosphere.  These experiments are technically challenging, but                
              the experimental technique has been shown to be feasible, and                  
              important quantitative measurements can be extracted.
