Abstract    :
                   The main objective of this research is to develop and                     
              demonstrate an intelligent machining monitoring and diagnostic                 
              system for quality assurance in end-milling.  This will be based               
              on the integration of multiple sensors outputs, such as acoustic               
              emission, vibration, cutting force, and cutting temperature, with              
              cutting conditions via artificial neural networks in conjunction               
              with an expert system.  Product quality characteristics such as                
              surface finish and tolerance will be estimated and, therefore,                 
              eventually maintained by the system during end-milling. The                    
              research team will conduct machining experiments to acquire data               
              and determine the best sensor feature that correlates to product               
              quality, develop multi-sensor integrated neural networks for                   
              estimating product quality, develop trend classification neural                
              network for identifying trends and train and evaluate the                      
              performance of these networks.                                                 
                   Product quality in manufacturing is of paramount importance               
              especially in view of the tremendous competition that we face in               
              the globalized marketplace.  Pioneering work of this nature, where             
              the latest developments in artificial intelligence are applied to              
              basic problems in manufacturing and in close cooperation with a                
              United States machine tool manufacturer, will help domestic                    
              manufacturing compete successfully.
