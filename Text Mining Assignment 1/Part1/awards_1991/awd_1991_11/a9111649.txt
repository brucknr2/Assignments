Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research will analyze the relationship between firm               
              location decisions, geographic concentration, and trade patterns               
              by developing several related theoretical models and empirically               
              testing the results.  The foundations will consist of an imperfect             
              competition model of firm location, in which learning spillovers               
              from direct contact with suppliers and customers provide an impetus            
              for concentration.  The model will be extended to analyze the                  
              evolution of firm location and trade patterns over the product life            
              cycle.  A second extension will consider the effect of government              
              intervention on industry location.  The research will conclude with            
              empirical tests of the relationship posited by the model between               
              comparative advantage and concentration of related industries and              
              consumer density, as against competing hypotheses emphasizing                  
              factor supplies and transport costs.                                           
                                                                                             
              The Research Planning Grant would be used to review related                    
              literature, to develop a working paper version of the model                    
              illustrating the core relationships, to assess the evidence on                 
              relevant government policies, and to identify and tap data sources             
              for the empirical component.  It would lead to the submission of               
              a full research proposal to the NSF at the end of one year.
