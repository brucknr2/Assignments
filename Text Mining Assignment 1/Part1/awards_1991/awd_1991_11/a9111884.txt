Abstract    :
              This award provides aid in the construction of plant growth                    
              facilities to be shared by a group of investigators who do                     
              biochemical and genetic research on corn and Arabidopsis.                      
              Growth facilities that provide reproducible conditions for                     
              plants are crucial to the kinds of careful, quantitative                       
              analysis needed for the effective use of plants in modern                      
              biology.  Moreover, such facilities increase the                               
              productivity of plant researchers since the growing season                     
              for plants like maize can be extended to cover the fall and                    
              winter months.  The award will augment the capacity for                        
              growth of corn at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory by 50%                     
              and will provide for an even greater augmentation for growth                   
              of Arabidopsis, a plant particularly well suited to basic                      
              studies of plant growth, development and reproduction.
