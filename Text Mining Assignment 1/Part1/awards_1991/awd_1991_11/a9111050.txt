Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Voluntary compliance by citizens with the laws and policies of the             
              nation is fundamental to the stable functioning of democratic                  
              society.  Although compliance can be produced in the short run by              
              force, theory maintains that in the long run compliance must be                
              voluntary if democratic institutions are to survive.                           
                                                                                             
              This study examines the nature, extent, and determinants of                    
              voluntary or contingent compliance by comparing decisions to                   
              volunteer for military service with decisions to resistance                    
              military conscription.  Two critical cases will be examined, the               
              Irish in Britain during the late 19th and early 20th century and               
              the French Canadians during this century.  These cases will be used            
              to test the hypothesis that voluntary compliance is possible only              
              when institutional arrangements exists that provide information to             
              the public so that government policies are perceived as fair and               
              other citizens are perceived as doing their fair share.                        
                                                                                             
              When completed this study will enhance our understanding of the                
              circumstances under which citizens will voluntarily comply with                
              government laws and policies.  The findings should have                        
              implications not only for contemporary democracies such as the                 
              United States but for the many nations in Eastern Europe and the               
              third world that are struggling to establish stable democratic                 
              rule.
