Abstract    :
              This project examines the social impacts of rapid social change on             
              the expectations and aspirations of rural youth in Alaska. Surveys             
              will be administered to high school students in two regions: the               
              Northwest Arctic Borough, site of the Red Dog Zink Mine, and the               
              Bristol Bay Area, where  there has been little or no oil or mining             
              development. The object is to compare the responses of students in             
              terms of educational, occupational, and residential aspirations and            
              expectations, as well as attitudes toward family, community and                
              the environment. The project will address the limitations of                   
              previous social-impact research, collect data directly from high               
              school students, and provide cross-national and cross-cultural                 
              comparisons using data from Scotland and Newfoundland.
