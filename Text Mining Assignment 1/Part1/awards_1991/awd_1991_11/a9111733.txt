Abstract    :
              This research is an experimental program concerned with the nature             
              of relaxation phenomena that appear in supercooled liquids and                 
              glasses.  Dielectric susceptibility measurements over 14 decadses              
              in frequency will be utilized to investigate various aspects of                
              universal behavior seen in recent experiments on liquids near the              
              glass transition.  Specific heat experiments are planned to search             
              for similar universal behavior in the relaxation of the enthalpy.              
              Dielectric susceptibility measurements in the glass state will be              
              used to investigate secondary relaxation.  In parallel, low                    
              temperature specific heat measurements will be made to make a                  
              direct comparison with the secondary relaxation data to check                  
              whether they can be related by current theories of the glassy                  
              state.  Computer simulations will be carried out in parallel with              
              these experimental studies.
