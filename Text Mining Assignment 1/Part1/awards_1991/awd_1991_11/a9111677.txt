Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are:  (A) Development of lower-cost             
              techniques for concurrent detection of program execution errors                
              caused by processor hardware faults, (B) development of lower-cost             
              techniques for tolerating errors caused by transient faults, (C)               
              development of theory that sets optimal bounds on the effectiveness            
              of such techniques, and (D) development of analytical and                      
              experimental methods for evaluating the techniques against the                 
              theoretical bounds.  New techniques are developed using a behavior-            
              based-error-detection paradigm, in which a simple error-detection              
              coprocessor monitors a program for deviations from a compiler-                 
              formed abstraction of its behavior.  Existing low-cost behavior-               
              based techniques exploit certain redundancies in program codes or              
              in a processor's architecture.  New techniques are also developed              
              by using the methods from information theory, coding theory, and               
              graph theory to identify new redundancies to exploit, and by using             
              experimental data to uncover gaps between existing techniques and              
              theoretical bounds.  Concurrent error detection is necessary                   
              because transient faults are becoming more frequent as device size             
              decreases, as the number of devices per processor and the number               
              of processors per computer grows, and as more computers are                    
              subjected to noisy environments.  The proposed work is important               
              because, although computer dependability is increasingly important,            
              existing concurrent-error-detection methods are too costly for all             
              but a few applications.
