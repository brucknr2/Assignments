Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is purchasing a Fourier Transform                     
              Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer to broaden the scope of IR                        
              applications and introduce new experiments in the organic                      
              chemistry laboratories.  The instrument is also being used in                  
              the advanced laboratories in instrumental analysis, physical                   
              chemistry, inorganic chemistry and undergraduate research.  A                  
              special emphasis is being placed on the use of the instrument                  
              for polymer characterization.
