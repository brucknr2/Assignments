Abstract    :
              The department of Chemistry is equipping a laboratory for the                  
              synthesis, characterization, processing and property                           
              determination of chain and step-growth polymers.  Students in                  
              the course convert a monomer to polymer to product with                        
              intermediate laboratory work in molecular and mechanical                       
              characterization. Upon completion of the two semester                          
              integrated laboratory, many students undertake individual                      
              research projects on the synthesis and characterization of                     
              polymeric materials.
