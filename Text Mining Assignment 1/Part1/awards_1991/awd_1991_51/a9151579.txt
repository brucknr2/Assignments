Abstract    :
              The combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry                    
              (GC/MS) is a powerful instrumental technique for separating                    
              and identifying the components of complex mixtures such as                     
              those encountered in investigations in chemistry and biology.                  
              This project introduces a new half-course early in the                         
              curriculum to educate chemistry and biology majors in the                      
              theory and applications of this technique.  The instrument                     
              also will be used in advanced courses and in independent                       
              research projects.  The grantee will match the NSF grant                       
              from non-Federal sources.
