Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is developing several chemistry                       
              courses to attract non-majors including a popular one with a                   
              forensic science perspective.  A laboratory experience                         
              accompanies each of these courses so that non-majors experience                
              the type of thinking that a laboratory experience brings.                      
              Modern instrumentation is a part of this laboratory experience                 
              including computer control of instruments with data handling                   
              and manipulation by computer.A spectrofluorometer is being used                
              in several courses, but especially the forensic science course                 
              for non-majors.  Students are determining fluorescent spectra                  
              of motor oils and magic markers and comparing the spectra                      
              obtained by other students to determine whether oils and                       
              markers can be distinguished by their spectra.  Students are                   
              getting experience with manipulation and comparison of the                     
              spectra by computer software.  The fluorometer is being used in                
              courses for majors as well.
