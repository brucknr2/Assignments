Abstract    :
              The experimental physical chemistry course will incorporate a                  
              Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) experiment on defined                   
              single crystal palladium surfaces under ultra high vacuum                      
              conditions.  The needed apparatus will be constructed from                     
              components.  The experiment shows electron diffraction from a                  
              surface, as first observed by Davisson and Germer in 1925.                     
              This first demonstration of wave-particle duality, a purely                    
              quantum mechanical phenomenon, will be deeply instructive for                  
              students.  The LEED experiment also exposes surface structure                  
              and molecular adsorption, which are important in heterogenous                  
              catalysis and surface chemistry.  The grantee will match the                   
              NSF grant from non-Federal sources.
