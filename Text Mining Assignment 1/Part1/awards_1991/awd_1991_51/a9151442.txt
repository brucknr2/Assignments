Abstract    :
              The Chemistry department is purchasing a liquid chromatograph                  
              to upgrade the undergraduate chemistry laboratories  in                        
              Instrumental Methods of Analysis, Biochemistry, Analytical                     
              Chemistry and Microcomputer Interfacing. In addition to                        
              gradient elution, the students are gaining experience with                     
              electrochemical and fluoroscence detectors. The equipment is                   
              increasing the ability of students doing undergraduate research                
              to undertake projects in food irradition biomedical analysis.
