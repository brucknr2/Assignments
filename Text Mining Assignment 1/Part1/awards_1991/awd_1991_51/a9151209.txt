Abstract    :
              Calculus students are benefiting from a mathematics computer                   
              laboratory which provides computer tools for mathematical                      
              problem solving.  Students are becoming familiar with modern                   
              mathematical tools used in the workplace, are exposed to                       
              realistic problem solving, and are obtaining a deeper                          
              understanding of mathematical concepts through individual                      
              experimentation.  Materials from Duke University's Project Calc                
              are being used.  Selected area high school students are bused                  
              in to use the lab and provide them with early exposure to these                
              curriculum improvements and to encourage them to choose a                      
              mathematics/science major.
