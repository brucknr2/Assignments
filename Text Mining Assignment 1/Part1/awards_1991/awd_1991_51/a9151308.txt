Abstract    :
              A laboratory course in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology                      
              offers a hands-on experience of the current experimental                       
              techniques available for the detection, isolation,                             
              manipulation, and analysis of proteins and nucleic acids.  A                   
              chromatography refrigerator, fraction collector, and                           
              peristaltic pump are used for protein purification; a                          
              thermocycler is used for amplifying specific DNA sequences via                 
              the polymerase chain reaction; and a roller apparatus is used                  
              for bacterial culture.  The laboratory is also equipped with                   
              horizontal and vertical gel electrophoresis units and power                    
              supplies; orbital platform shakers and rockers, gel dryer, and                 
              electroblotting apparatus for gel transfer; microcentrifuges;                  
              and a UV-VIS spectrophotometer.  The equipment is also employed                
              in select molecular-based experiments of the genetics, cell                    
              biology, microbiology, physiology, and developmental biology                   
              courses, and greatly expand the opportunities currently                        
              available for undergraduate student research projects in all                   
              areas of biology and chemistry that require analysis of                        
              proteins or nucleic acids.
