Abstract    :
              A computer laboratory equipped with IBM PS/2 model 55SX                        
              computers running symbolic algebraic software is permitting                    
              students to actively "experiment with mathematics" and gain                    
              insights and understanding that are not possible with textbooks                
              alone. s' use.  This project allows students tackle more                       
              realistic problems and to learn mathematics interactively.
