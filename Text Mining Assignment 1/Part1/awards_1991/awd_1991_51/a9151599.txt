Abstract    :
              A laboratory is being developed for use in an upper level                      
              mathematical modeling course designed for mathematics majors                   
              and minors who have completed the calculus sequence and one                    
              differential equations course. As these students enter the                     
              workforce or pursue graduate studies, many will have access to                 
              high-performance workstations equipped with sophisticated                      
              mathematical software. The goal of the course is to improve the                
              education of undergraduates by teaching them how to use this                   
              technology as a source of input into the process of mathematics                
              rather than as a tool which simply provides a quicker answer to                
              a problem.
