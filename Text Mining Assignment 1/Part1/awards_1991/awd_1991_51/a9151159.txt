Abstract    :
              The Geology Department is purchasing SPARC based graphics                      
              workstations, and electronic measuring devices to bring three                  
              dimensional visualization, processing of data, and quantitative                
              field methods into the undergraduate curriculum. The graphics                  
              work stations, networked to a server with computer graphics,                   
              displays three dimensional models with interactive graphics                    
              that allows students to vary parameters and boundary conditions                
              for a variety of geologic problems.  Students create, render,                  
              and manipulate topographic models; geophysical or satellite                    
              data sets are superimposed on graphic models and some systems,                 
              such as avalanches or beach processes, can be animated on top                  
              of digital
