Abstract    :
              A VLSI integrated circuit design course is being developed for                 
              the Gonzaga University Electrical Engineering curriculum.  This                
              project provides for a laboratory to support the VLSI design                   
              course.  This enlarged VLSI design program provides the VLSI                   
              design course (EE475) and a follow-on course in integrated                     
              circuit testing (EE476).  The laboratory consists of a network                 
              of four SUN computer workstations and a Versatek electrostatic                 
              plotter.  The laboratory interfaces with the campus Ethernet                   
              for access to printer and backup storage facilities as well as                 
              provides wider access to the laboratory.  This equipment allows                
              student access to the "ChipCrafter" commercial VLSI design                     
              software package as well as software academic tool sets                        
              available from several sources.  Integrated circuit testing                    
              equipment is already on hand in the department to test the                     
              design products.
