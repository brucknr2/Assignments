Abstract    :
              The Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics at Bard                       
              College is utilizing funds for the purchase of computer                        
              workstations, networking equipment, and analytical software.                   
              Half of these machines are being used to create a networked                    
              computer classroom for teaching advanced computing                             
              applications, the rest are being installed in the individual                   
              departments of the Division.These facilities are used in a                     
              variety of courses in the Division, as well as in faculty and                  
              undergraduate research.  The immediate plans are to expand and                 
              enhance the existing offerings for majors in Data Analysis and                 
              Numerical Methods, to provide a computing resource for advanced                
              science work, and to develop quantitative courses for non-                     
              majors.  The workstations allow a sophisticated combination of                 
              calculational, statistical, graphical, and symbolic treatment                  
              of quantitative concepts and methods.  This allows a raising of                
              the level of quantitative work in classes and in student                       
              research projects.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds                 
              from non-federal sources.
