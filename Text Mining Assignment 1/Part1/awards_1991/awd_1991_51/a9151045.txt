Abstract    :
              The acquisition of a 200 MHz Fourier transform Nuclear Magnetic                
              Resonance spectrometer with multinuclear and variable                          
              temperature capabilities will improve the quality of the                       
              chemistry program.  The instrument will be used by all of the                  
              chemistry majors, many allied science majors including physics                 
              and biology majors, area secondary school chemistry teachers,                  
              and selected minority high school students.  Hands-on                          
              undergraduate student use of FT-NMR will occur in the organic                  
              chemistry, organic instrumental analysis, chemical synthesis,                  
              physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, and biochemistry                     
              courses, as well as in student research projects.  A positive                  
              long range effect will result from the exposure of secondary                   
              school chemistry teachers and high school minority students to                 
              this important new technology.  The grantee will match the NSF                 
              award from non-Federal sources.
