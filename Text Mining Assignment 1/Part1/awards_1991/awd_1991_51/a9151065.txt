Abstract    :
              An undergraduate computing laboratory introducing the students                 
              to the modern practice of expert systems, specifically when                    
              applied to design of thermal energy systems, is established.                   
              The laboratory consists of one personal workstation and two                    
              terminals, completely configured.  Softwares associated with                   
              the development of thermal-design expert systems is used by the                
              students to gain exposure and hands-on experience.
