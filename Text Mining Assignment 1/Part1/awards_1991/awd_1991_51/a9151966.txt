Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funds to upgrade our Research Methodology                  
              Laboratory by replacing the current Apple IIe microcomputers                   
              with Macintosh LC microcomputers connected to a local area                     
              network (LAN) Psychology majors in their sophomore year will                   
              acquire some laboratory experience with data collection and                    
              data analysis that represent state of the art technology, and                  
              these "hands-on" laboratory experiences will provide pre-                      
              requisite skills necessary for more advanced courses in                        
              psychology.  Exposure of the students to up-to-date equipment                  
              and comtemporary research methods will enhance the quality of                  
              instruction.  Furthermore, the department will expand its                      
              undergraduate facility from stand-alone work-stations to a LAN                 
              with increased memory capacity and access to the campus LAN.                   
              This project is significant because it will remove the present                 
              frustration encumbered by both faculty and students who must                   
              use limited outdated equipment, and it will enable instructors                 
              to incorporate state of the art demonstrations of psychological                
              phenomenon in a number of other psychology courses.
