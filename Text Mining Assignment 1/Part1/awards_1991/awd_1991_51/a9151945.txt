Abstract    :
              Students at Ohio State University are studying calculus in  a                  
              computer lab  containing NeXT computers and running                            
              MATHEMATICA. The materials they are using are being developed                  
              as part of the Calculus & Mathematica project of H. Porta and                  
              J. Uhl at Illinois and W. Davis at Ohio State.  The project                    
              provides a "living textbook", total immersion, singularly                      
              tutorial approach to learning calculus to students.  The                       
              textbook is being written and piloted at Illinois and Ohio                     
              State, and being adopted by several other institutions now.                    
              The focus of the project, in the eyes of the developers, is on                 
              the Mathematics of Calculus, and the appropriate teaching of                   
              the subject.
