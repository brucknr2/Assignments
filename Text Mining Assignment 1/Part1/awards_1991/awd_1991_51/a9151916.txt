Abstract    :
              This project is enabling Vanderbilt University to acquire                      
              instrumentation to teach about the nonlinear interactions of                   
              light with matter, as part of the University's advanced                        
              laboratory in optics and lasers. The project is motivated by                   
              increasing demand for significant instruction in the techniques                
              and concepts of modern optical physics, both in the advanced                   
              laboratory and in independent study and in honors projects.                    
              Recent proof-of-concept experiments have included studies of                   
              nonlinear laser-matter interactions in Chinese green tea,                      
              cresyl violet dye, and ion-implanted fused silica. This                        
              project-oriented approach to nonlinear optics with cw lasers is                
              giving undergraduate students a unique opportunity to have fun                 
              with serious optical physics, and motivating them toward early                 
              involvement in research.The project is enhancing teaching                      
              effectiveness, because nonlinear laser interactions are at the                 
              heart of many of the most fertile areas of laser and optical                   
              science. Moreover, nonlinear optical physics in solids and                     
              liquids is a powerfully and quintessentially integrative field                 
              of inquiry, bringing together experiment and theory, optical                   
              and condensed-matter physics, quantum and classical physics.                   
              The new instructional activities using cw infrared and visible                 
              laser light include: studies of self-focusing and self-trapping                
              of laser beams, optical switching experiments, and modeling of                 
              nonlinear processes in solids and liquids.NSF grant funds are                  
              being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
