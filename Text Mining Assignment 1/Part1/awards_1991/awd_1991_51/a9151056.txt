Abstract    :
              Hypertext software using ToolBook is being developed to                        
              acquaint the general student with principles of light and                      
              sound.  Approximately 100 students enroll each year in PHYS 101                
              Light and Visual Phenomena, and PHYS 102 The Physics of Sound                  
              and Music.  These 3-hour courses satisfy part of the general-                  
              education science requirement at UNCA.  The author is currently                
              employing original EGA-graphics software in class using a rear-                
              view SONY projector in the modern 180-seat auditorium of the                   
              new science building, Robinson Hall.  Students work after class                
              with the software interactively in departmental computer                       
              labs.The project brings a significant enhancement to the                       
              educational experience by adding interactive hypertext                         
              applications.  The author developed ToolBook applications after                
              receiving a pre-released version from IBM.  These were                         
              presented at the IBM ACIS Conference in Miami and are being                    
              shipped with IBM's Advanced Academic System.  Equipment being                  
              purchased includes eight 386SX l6-MHz computers with VGA, DOS,                 
              Windows 3.0, and ToolBook.NSF grant funds are being matched                    
              with funds from non-federal sources.
