Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology is purchasing a semi-automated x-ray                 
              diffraction unit to teach modern x-ray diffraction techniques                  
              in the undergraduate geology curriculum.  Students are using                   
              the technique to study crystal structures and mineralogy,                      
              introductory mineralogy and petrology courses, and in advanced                 
              courses in optical mineralogy, petrography, glacial and                        
              Quaternary geology, sedimentary petrology, archaeological                      
              geology, and economic geology.  The diffractometer is also                     
              being used by undergraduates in independent research projects.
