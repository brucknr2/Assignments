Abstract    :
              The quality of undergraduate laboratory work will be enhanced                  
              by the introduction of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy                 
              in general chemistry and in three advanced courses.   General                  
              chemistry students will determine the amounts of different                     
              crystalline forms of calcium carbonate in seashells, and                       
              identify the polymeric components of a commercial plastic.                     
              Organic chemistry students will characterize the products of                   
              two reactions by modern methods, including the electronic                      
              storage and manipulation of spectral data.  Students will                      
              perform a new experiment in physical chemistry involving the                   
              kinetics of isomerization of a cobalt amine complex.  The                      
              grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
