Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to establish a new course in                       
              genetic engineering techniques that provides students with the                 
              opportunity to carry out basic experiments in gene                             
              manipulation.  The gel electrophoresis equipment, centrifuges,                 
              spectrophotometers, transilluminators and vacuum blotters are                  
              used to excise genes from source DNA, insert these genes into                  
              plasmid vectors, transform bacterial cells with these plasmids,                
              screen for clones containing inserted genes, and produce DNA
