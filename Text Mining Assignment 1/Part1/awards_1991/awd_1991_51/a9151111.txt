Abstract    :
              The undergraduate chemistry and physics curricula will be                      
              enhanced by incorporating an electron paramagnetic resonance                   
              (EPR) spectrometer.  The range of applications of EPR has                      
              widened significantly because of developments in                               
              instrumentation.  We will carry out new and existing                           
              experiments in the areas of biochemistry, organic chemistry,                   
              physical chemistry, and inorganic chemistry, as well as                        
              analytical chemistry and materials science.  The instrument                    
              will broaden our laboratory program for upper-level courses in                 
              chemistry and physics and will also have a significant impact                  
              on undergraduate research.  In addition to research projects                   
              for seniors receiving honors degrees, smaller projects have                    
              been designed for less sophisticated students, including non-                  
              science majors.
