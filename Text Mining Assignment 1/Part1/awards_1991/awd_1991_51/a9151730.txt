Abstract    :
              This project introduces experimental astrophysics to the                       
              undergraduate physics curriculum via the mini-project-based                    
              advanced physics laboratory, through upperclass independent                    
              study/research projects, and to a lesser degree, the                           
              introductory astronomy courses.  These goals are achieved by                   
              the replacement of the current educational grade 10" telescope                 
              with a 16" research grade instrument, and the associated                       
              acquisition of a CCD camera system for digital imaging                         
              analysis.  A computer workstation is included for using                        
              existing sophisticated UNIX-based imaging software.  The                       
              equipment effectively complements the existing observatory                     
              facility and instrumentation available, and the projected                      
              experimentation made possible with it significantly contribute                 
              to the current student research capabilities of the department.
