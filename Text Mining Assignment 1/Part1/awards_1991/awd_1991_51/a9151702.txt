Abstract    :
              Modernization of X-ray equipment is allowing improvement of                    
              undergraduate laboratory instruction in selected courses and in                
              undergraduate research in the department of Mathematical and                   
              Physical Sciences at Northwestern State University of                          
              Louisiana.  Equipment acquired with grant funds includes a                     
              microprocessor based control and data acquisition system with                  
              computer interfacing.  Students now are able to carry out                      
              experiments with greater ease and accuracy, are able to make                   
              determinations which have been either impossible or very time                  
              consuming, and are gaining experience in working with                          
              instrumentation of the type encountered in industry or graduate                
              school.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-                  
              Federal sources.
