Abstract    :
              The Mathematics and Computer Science Departments at Wofford                    
              College are undertaking a project to enhance learning with                     
              extensive use of computer graphics through the development of                  
              a laboratory with 13 workstations.  Each of three classrooms                   
              are  equipped with a workstation so that the technology is                     
              integrated into the class lectures, and faculty also have                      
              access to computers in their offices.  To enhance many of its                  
              courses from the freshman to the senior level the Mathematics                  
              Department is incorporating the Mathematica symbolic algebra                   
              system and other software with high-quality graphics.  Through                 
              innovative use of the new technology, students gain a                          
              conceptual understanding and appreciation of the importance of                 
              many subjects and are more able to concentrate on problem                      
              solving instead of tedious details of computation.  THe                        
              Computer Science Department is increasing and upgrading its                    
              offerings with new courses in computer graphics and programming                
              projects, each taught using modern graphics displays.                          
              Implementation of this project accomplishes two major goals at                 
              Wofford College: (1) improves and extends computer science                     
              education leading to the possibility of a computer                             
              science/mathematics major, and (2) strenghthens and enlivens                   
              mathematics education through computer technology.
