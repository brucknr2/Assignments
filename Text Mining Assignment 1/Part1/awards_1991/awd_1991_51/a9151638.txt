Abstract    :
              A UNIX-based laboratory equipped with Sun SPARC workstations                   
              will be established for the enhancement of several courses in                  
              the computer science curriculum at Winston-Salem State                         
              University.  The computers are used to teach courses in UNIX                   
              and FORTRAN and provide enhancement for courses in Graphics,                   
              Numerical Analysis, and System Simulation and Modeling.  They                  
              also provide facilities necessary for student design projects                  
              in a Software Development course and in the Computer Science                   
              Seminar; these projects are taken from areas such as neural                    
              networks or scientific computing in FORTRAN.  Since these                      
              workstations replicate the kind of equipment found in                          
              scientific laboratories across the country, the projects can be                
              parts of ongoing research.  This equipment, with its                           
              interconnections, modems, and links to state networks, give                    
              students experience in networking.  In summary, it provides                    
              attractive exposure to the scientific/technical side of                        
              computer science.
