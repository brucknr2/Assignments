Abstract    :
              High resolution FT-NMR mainly for use in organic chemistry will                
              upgrade the chemistry instructional program.  Hands-on NMR                     
              exercises will introduce students to structural concepts and                   
              the capabilities of the instrument in solving structural                       
              problems.  Students in the advanced laboratories for majors                    
              (organic, organometallic, analytical, and physical) will use                   
              the instrument for more sophisticated problems such as the                     
              determination of polymer structures, examination of fluxional                  
              character including hindered rotation, the acquisition of                      
              kinetic data for relaxation processes, and solvation numbers of                
              metal ions.  The instrument will also be used by students in                   
              independent research projects.The grantee will match the NSF                   
              award from non-federal sources.
