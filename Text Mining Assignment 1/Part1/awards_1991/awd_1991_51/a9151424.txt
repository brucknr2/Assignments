Abstract    :
              The computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) laboratory provides                
              Engineering Technology students with a sound education in areas                
              which constitute a major shaping factor in virtually all                       
              branches of industry and business.  The equipment required in                  
              the CIM laboratory includes a mini-CIM system, computer                        
              equipment, and statistical process control gauging instrument.                 
              This equipment is integrated with existing robotics facilities                 
              to produce a teaching instrument and an integral part of                       
              several courses such as Introduction to Robotics and Computer                  
              Integrated Manufacturing, Industrial Systems Simulation,                       
              Statistical Quality Control, Production Planning, Plant Layout,                
              Materials Handling, Productivity Measurement and Improvement,                  
              and Automation & Computer Integrated Manufacturing.
