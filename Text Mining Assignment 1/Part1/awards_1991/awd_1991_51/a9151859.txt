Abstract    :
              The Geology Department is acquiring equipment for training in                  
              field methods in hydrogeology. Students are using a borehole                   
              resistivity system to study the geologic environment of                        
              groundwater; data collected through the use of the water level                 
              meters, data loggers, and lysimeters enable them to understand                 
              the conditions that result in groundwater flow and storage                     
              changes within the subsurface. The equipment is also being used                
              to detect groundwater contamination and assess its severity and
