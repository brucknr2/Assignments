Abstract    :
              The Department of Earth Sciences will purchase a tethersonde                   
              system for use in upper level meteorology courses and                          
              undergraduate research. Meteorology students are conducting                    
              detailed studies of the vertical and temporal structure of the                 
              atmosphere under a variety of conditions on a routine basis by                 
              performing controlled soundings of the earth 5 boundary layer                  
              (0-3 km). The students practical experience with the                           
              instruments enables them to develop necessary skills in data                   
              reduction and error analysis, as well as participate in                        
              organized investigations of atmospheric phenomena.The grantee                  
              will provide funds for this project that are equal to the                      
              amount requested from NSF in this proposal.
