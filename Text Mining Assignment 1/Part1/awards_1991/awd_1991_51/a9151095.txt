Abstract    :
              A microcomputer teaching lab is established and equipped with                  
              hardware permitting the instructor to control all student                      
              workstations and thereby lead the students through the early                   
              steps of problem solving exercises.  Upon reaching a level of                  
              experience and confidence, the students use the network to                     
              access Sun workstations using DOS and X-Windows.  Video records                
              of data analysis and simulation runs provide an excellent                      
              medium for communicating basic transportation analysis skills                  
              to undergraduate civil engineers. In addition to permitting                    
              laboratory exercises to be conducted in an innovative and                      
              superior learning environment, the facility provides a location                
              for student experimentation with innovative equipment and                      
              exposure to new traffic control and analysis systems.
