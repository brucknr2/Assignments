Abstract    :
              Students are learning by exploration and experimenting with                    
              graphs in pre-calculus using the text by Demana and Waits.  The                
              learning experience is enhanced by an expanded computer                        
              laboratory with Macintosh computers running Mathemtica.  The                   
              former laboratory supported a revised calculus curriculum and                  
              the expanded laboratory will enhance these improvements and                    
              revised courses in linear algebra, differential equations, and                 
              multivariable calculus.
