Abstract    :
              The Ocean Studies Institute is purchasing a side scan sonar and                
              sub-bottom profiler for installation on an oceanographic vessel                
              shared by a seven campus consortium. The equipment is being                    
              used in conjunction with a magnetometer and an automated multi-                
              parameter probe system to enable undergraduates to study the                   
              principles and techniques of characterizing ocean bottom                       
              topography, submarine faults, hydrocarbon seepage, and                         
              submerged cultural resources, among others. The project is                     
              contributing to an increased understanding of the environmental                
              and economic effects of human activities along the South                       
              California coast.
