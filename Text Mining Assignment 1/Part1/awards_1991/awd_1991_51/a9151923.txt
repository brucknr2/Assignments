Abstract    :
              This project is used in several undergraduate laboratory                       
              courses in metallurgy/materials engineering in experiments                     
              providing meaningful data generation, acquisition and analysis                 
              of the thermal properties of polymers, ceramics and metals. The                
              experiments that the system exposes the students to the                        
              thermodynamic properties of materials in relation to their                     
              structure and properties.
