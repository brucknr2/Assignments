Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are to integrate critical thinking                   
              and problem solving skills into the biology program for majors                 
              and non-majors, increase student participation in independent                  
              research, and enhance the access of pre-college women and                      
              minority students to careers in the biological sciences.  These                
              goals are being supported with the acquisition of MacIIsi                      
              computer work stations installed in introductory biology                       
              laboratories and in a computer facility that students will have                
              access to at other hours.  The computers will be used for                      
              interactive analysis of data from laboratory experiments,                      
              simulated analyses of experiments that are too expensive or too                
              dangerous to perform in the teaching laboratory, for                           
              independent study, and for writing assignments.
