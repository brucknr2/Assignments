Abstract    :
              The development of an environmental fluid mechanics laboratory                 
              which integrates physical and mathematical modeling is planned.                
              Interdisciplinary problems of environmental contaminant                        
              transport increasingly demand appreciation for and capability                  
              with sophisticated mathematical and computational modeling.                    
              Simultaneous observation of physical and mathematical models is                
              the planned laboratory experience.  Sand box and column                        
              experiments in porous media flow are designed, constructed, and                
              operated to demonstrate streamlines, transport, and flow rates.                
              Free surface flow experiments are conducted in a demonstration                 
              flume. Concurrent with operating experiments,                                  
              mathematical/computer models with graphical display are                        
              validated by comparison to the physical models.  Having                        
              completed validation, the mathematical models are extended to                  
              examine flow conditions beyond the constraints of the physical                 
              experiments.
