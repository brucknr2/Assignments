Abstract    :
              The Department of Geography and geology is acquiring a                         
              gravimeter to provide hands-on data collection ability for                     
              students in the introductory through upper division courses.                   
              This acquisition allows introductory students to observe long                  
              period seismic waves and calculate earthquake epicenters.                      
              Advanced students, in geophysics courses, are using the                        
              equipment to measure earth tides , conduct gravity surveys, and                
              calculate anomalies. The instrument is also increasing the                     
              ability of
