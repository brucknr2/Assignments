Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 300 MHz FT-NMR for                 
              use throughout the four-year integrated laboratory sequence.                   
              Students begin using the instrument during the second semester                 
              of the freshman year to investigate the structures of simple                   
              terpenes.  Upper students are investigating reaction kinetcs,                  
              reaction intermediates, and conducting independent studies with                
              the aid of this equipment.
