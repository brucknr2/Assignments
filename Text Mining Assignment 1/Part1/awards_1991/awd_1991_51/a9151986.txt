Abstract    :
              The Ocean Studies Department is purchasing a Remotely Operated                 
              Vehicle, a Sidescan Sonar, and a navigational computer system                  
              for installation on the Academy's seagoing vessels. The                        
              equipment is being used by both majors and nonmajors in Ocean                  
              Studies to study seabed topography and biota. The equipment is                 
              enhancing ongoing study of long and short term changes in                      
              biological communities and the seabed.
