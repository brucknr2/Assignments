Abstract    :
              An FTIR spectrophotometer will support a number of new                         
              experiments in our courses.  It will be a central focus of the                 
              laboratory experiments in instrumental analysis and analytic                   
              chemistry, in organic and physical chemistry, and in our new                   
              advanced inorganic laboratory.  The instrument will provide for                
              new techniques in sample handling and data manipulation, as                    
              well as library searching.  The grantee will match the NSF                     
              award from non-Federal sources.
