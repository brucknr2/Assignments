Abstract    :
              In order to teach scientific principles and methods to                         
              psychology majors In an applied field, we propose the                          
              establishment of a laboratory in comparative psychology. This                  
              project is designed to meet two goals. First, it will allow the                
              psychology department to create a new undergraduate laboratory                 
              course in animal behavior.  Second, the laboratory and                         
              computing equipment will allow students to perform detailed                    
              acoustic and statistical analysis of the species-typical vocal                 
              behavior of zebra finches.  By doing this, psychology majors                   
              will have the opportunity to become involved in techniques and                 
              methods of scientific research that are normally not available                 
              to them.Clearly, the optimal undergraduate research experience                 
              Involves students working in faculty research laboratories.                    
              Unfortunately, this approach limits the number of students who                 
              have contact with the faculty member, and the types of research                
              projects in which the students may participate. By establishing                
              a student laboratory in an area that matches the research of a                 
              faculty member, these problems are eliminated.
