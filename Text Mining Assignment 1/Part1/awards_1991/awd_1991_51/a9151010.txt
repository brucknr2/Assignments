Abstract    :
              A Far Infrared Fourier Transform (FTIR) Spectrometer is being                  
              utilized for student research at Coe College.  This capability                 
              complements that being acquired by the College through its                     
              purchase of a mid-range FTIR spectrometer. Student research is                 
              a major benefactor of this instrument through the college's                    
              well-developed project on research into properties and                         
              structure of alkali borate and borosilicate glasses and related                
              crystals.  In addition, several physics courses also make good                 
              use of this instrument.NSF grant funds are being matched with                  
              funds from non-federal sources.
