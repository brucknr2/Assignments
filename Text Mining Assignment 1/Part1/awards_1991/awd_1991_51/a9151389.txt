Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to significantly upgrade the                  
              laboratory experience of engineering undergraduates in the area                
              of composites manufacture and testing.  The core of the                        
              Composites Engineering Multidisciplinary Certificate Program is                
              a four course sequence culminating with the integrating, hands-                
              on experience of the laboratory course.  The equipment provides                
              students experience in three crucial technologies used in                      
              industry.  A resin transfer molding experiment allows students                 
              to study reaction kinetics and the effect of flow dynamics on                  
              final part quality.  The multi-axis, computer-controlled                       
              filament winding machine allows the students to design,                        
              analyze, and fabricate complex parts in a paperless, automated                 
              environment.  An upgrade to an ultrasonic testing device,                      
              consisting of a computerized data acquisition and analysis                     
              system, allows the students to more accurately detect flaws in                 
              the parts that they have fabricated during the term.  The                      
              laboratory provides a quality, state-of-the-art experience for                 
              approximately 200 students.  Implementation has a substantial                  
              long-term effect on the students' laboratory experience and                    
              better equips them to assume leadership roles in the field of                  
              advanced materials design and manufacturing.
