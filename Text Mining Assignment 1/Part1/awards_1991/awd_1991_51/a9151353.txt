Abstract    :
              Trinity University is creating a molecular computing laboratory                
              which undergraduate chemistry students will use to calculate                   
              molecular geometries and compare the theoretical results with                  
              those determined experimentally, model vibrational-rotational                  
              spectra, predict regiochemistry of Diels-Alder reactions, and                  
              evaluate enzyme mechanisms in two-substrate systems by a                       
              combination of laboratory and simulated experiments.
