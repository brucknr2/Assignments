Abstract    :
              This project provides for the implementation of a                              
              microprocessor-based materials testing apparatus in the                        
              Structural and Materials Testing laboratory.  Installation of                  
              modern microprocessor-based materials testing equipment                        
              significantly enriches the engineering laboratory course, and                  
              allows support of a much broader range of senior thesis                        
              projects related to the use of composite materials in the                      
              marine industry.
