Abstract    :
              The Interactive Calculus Laboratory consists of a network of                   
              NeXT workstations running Mathematica.  Students are learning                  
              calculus by experimenting symbolically and graphically with                    
              fundamental concepts, concentrating less on routine                            
              calculations, and thinking more about underlying principles and                
              graphical realizations.  The NeXT workstations facilitate the                  
              use of Mathematica by their simple user interface, their l5-                   
              MIPS speed, their high resolution screens, their ancillary                     
              software', and their networking features.
