Abstract    :
              Ripon College is acquiring a gas chromatograph-mass                            
              spectrometer (GC/MS) system for use by students in the organic                 
              microscale laboratory, and in the non-majors course in forensic                
              science. The instrument is also being used in advanced                         
              laboratory and instrumental analysis courses, as well as in                    
              undergraduate research.
