Abstract    :
              The existing Industrial Robotics Laboratory provides                           
              undergraduate students in three required courses and six                       
              technical elective courses with adequate educational                           
              demonstrations and experiments.  The focus has been on the                     
              basic principles of industrial robotic technology.  The                        
              workstation augmentation will permit enhancement of the                        
              laboratory experience through addition of topics such as                       
              concurrent engineering design of robotic solutions, integration                
              of robotic devices in Computer Integrated Manufacturing                        
              systems, off-line task level and application oriented                          
              programming, and computer- aided design of essential robotic                   
              applications that are difficult to include in a university lab,                
              such as welding and painting.  The equipment used includes a                   
              color graphic work-station with an integrated CAD software                     
              package for robotic work-cell design, kinematic, dynamic and                   
              graphic simulation, and off-line task programming.
