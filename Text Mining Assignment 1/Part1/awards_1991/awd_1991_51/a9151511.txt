Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to integrate computerized                          
              molecular modeling into the curriculum for biochemistry and                    
              molecular biology offered jointly by the Chemistry and Biology                 
              Departments.  The high performance Silicon Graphics Workstation                
              and associated software purchased with this grant allows                       
              students to display and manipulate images of biological                        
              macromolecules, and to simulate the behavior of macromolecules,                
              and it gives them experience with the state-of-the-art tools                   
              they will be using as they pursue careers in biochemistry or                   
              molecular biology.  It also provides faculty with a powerful                   
              pedagogical tool to introduce students to the fascinating and                  
              complex world of
