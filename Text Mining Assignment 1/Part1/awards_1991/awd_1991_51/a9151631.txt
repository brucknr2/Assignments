Abstract    :
               In a cooperative effort, the University of Nebraska at                        
              Omaha(UNO) and the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)                
              have implemented an innovative biotechnology program to provide                
              state of the art experience in molecular biology to                            
              undergraduate students. A rigorous laboratory curriculum                       
              includes a Biotechnology internship where students will join a                 
              molecular biology research laboratory at UNO or UNMC for one                   
              semester. The cornerstones of this program are two newly                       
              designed lecture and laboratory courses, Virology and Molecular                
              Genetics, at UNO. The requested equipment will enable the                      
              program to add new experiments critical to the Biotechnology                   
              degree to each of the courses.  The major equipment items to be                
              acquired include: a floor model ultracentrifuge and rotors; a                  
              microcentrifuge; an electrophoresis power supply, an                           
              electrophoresis apparatus for sequencing; a hybridization                      
              chamber; a pressure blotting system; a UV-crosslinking                         
              apparatus; an electroblotting system; adjustable micropipettes                 
              and a Geiger-Muller radiation monitor. These additions will                    
              substantially improve the molecular biology curriculum at UNO                  
              and thereby facilitate the full implementation of the new                      
              Biotechnology degree program.
