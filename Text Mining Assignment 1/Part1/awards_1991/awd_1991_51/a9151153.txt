Abstract    :
              A computer classroom/laboratory equipped with Macintosh IIsi                   
              computers running Mathematica is being used by students to                     
              learn calculus in a more stimulating setting.  The emphasis is                 
              on student-centered learning as opposed to teacher-centered                    
              instruction.  This emphasis is carried out through educed                      
              lecture time, in-class discussion, "brainstorming" and problem                 
              sessions, the use of a graphing calculator, and the assignment                 
              of outside problem sets.
