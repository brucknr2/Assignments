Abstract    :
              The study of organic, physical, and analytical chemistry by                    
              undergraduates will be integrated through use of nuclear                       
              magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  Experiments to be performed                  
              in organic lab in place of the normal synthesis labs include                   
              Instrumental Aspects of NMR, and Keto-Enol Tautomerization                     
              Kinetics.  Two experiments involving NMR will also be added to                 
              the physical chemistry course:  Effect of NMR Shift Reagents on                
              NMR Spectra, and Determination of Para-magnetic Susceptibility                 
              using NMR.  Quantitative uses of the technique will be                         
              introduced into the second semester quantitative analysis                      
              course.  The technique will also be used extensively in the                    
              organic qualitative analysis course to augment traditional                     
              means of identifying unknowns.  The grantee will match the NSF                 
              award from  non-Federal sources.
