Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is acquiring an FTIR spectrometer for                 
              use in freshman through senior chemistry courses. Students are                 
              using the instrument in nine new experiments which have been                   
              developed.  At the freshman level the instrument is aiding                     
              students in the identification of a copper complexes; at the                   
              upper level steric effects on hydrogen bonding, analysis of                    
              solids by diffuse reflectance methods, and reaction kinetics                   
              studies are being explored.
