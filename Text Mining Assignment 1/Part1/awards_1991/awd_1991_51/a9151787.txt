Abstract    :
              This project is introducing students within the three-semester                 
              calculus-based introductory physics course at Southwest Texas                  
              State University to the utility of the computer in the                         
              laboratory. With each course the level of sophistication of                    
              computer use by the student increases concurrently with their                  
              development of mathematical expertise as they progress from one                
              level to the next.Each laboratory station is provided with an                  
              IBM PS/2, Model 30 computer. Complete Pasco Experiment Systems                 
              in Mechanics, Wave Motion, Optics and Nuclear Physics with                     
              software and interfaces are used by students in the first and                  
              second semester laboratories. The second and third semester                    
              laboratory students use Lab Windows software development and                   
              data analysis tools, Lab-PC I/0 interface boards, and signal                   
              conditioning modules.As one indication of Southwest Texas State                
              University's commitment to the project, the University is                      
              providing a two-to- one match of NSF funds.
