Abstract    :
              This proposal is one component of our plan to increase the                     
              participation of psychology majors in independent scientific                   
              research.  We have two goals:  One is to increase the quality                  
              of scientific thinking among our majors so that they will                      
              receive more effective liberal educations; the second is to                    
              encourage more students to pursue careers in cognitive science.                
              The requested microcomputer cluster will allow us to integrate                 
              research methods courses and cognitive core courses on                         
              learning, memory and cognition, and perception.  In addition,                  
              we will have greater flexibility to add timely experiments to                  
              the laboratories.  Students will be able to manipulate the                     
              parameters of those experiments so that they can participate                   
              more fully in the entire research process rather than simply                   
              doing experiments to confirm principles.  Finally, a supervised                
              cluster in the Psychology Department will give the students                    
              expert assistance in using the computers, and it will create a                 
              place where students can gather, carry out their research                      
              projects, and discuss the results.  This increased student                     
              involvement in research should lead to more students performing                
              independent projects.  Thus, we envision an integrated,                        
              laboratory based curricular path beginning with basic                          
              instruction in research design and analysis and culminating in                 
              a piece of independent research.
