Abstract    :
              Six new and modified laboratory experiments for physical,                      
              analytical, and inorganic chemistry are described that will                    
              take advantage of a computer-assisted scanning uv/vis/nir                      
              spectrophotometer.  Students will acquire kinetic and                          
              spectroscopic data in digital format and analyze these data                    
              using a scientific spreadsheet, such as RS/l.  Both second                     
              order and enzyme kinetics will be encountered; rate constants                  
              will be obtained using numerical methods of analysis.  The                     
              second derivative technique will be applied to electronic                      
              spectra to elucidate the excited states of molecular systems                   
              and the composition of complex mixtures.  Sophisticated                        
              graphics and the use of statistical information will be                        
              emphasized.  The grantee will match the NSF award from non-                    
              Federal sources.
