Abstract    :
              A subject area of increasing importance to mechanical engineers                
              is control systems and microcontrollers.  Mechanical engineers                 
              must often be able to translate the algorithmic processes used                 
              to control devices into the language of microcontrollers. A                    
              controls curriculum is being developed for undergraduate                       
              mechanical engineers, and as part of this curriculum project                   
              two microcontroller laboratory courses are developed. In these                 
              courses, the students learn about microcontroller architecture                 
              and interfacing, assembly and high-level language programming,                 
              advanced debugging techniques, analog and digital electronics,                 
              and industrial control systems and algorithms.
