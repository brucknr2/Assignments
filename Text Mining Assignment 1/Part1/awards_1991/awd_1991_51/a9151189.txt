Abstract    :
              This project is providing equipment (Carbon/Hydrogen/Nitrogen                  
              analyzer and an autoanalyzer) necessary to complete a modern                   
              instrumental analysis laboratory for undergraduate studies of                  
              plants and soils, ecosystem dynamics, and environmental                        
              problems in the Department of Environmental Science at                         
              Allegheny College.  This program was begun in 1985 with                        
              modernization of a course in Water Quality Analysis and with                   
              development of a Water Quality laboratory.  The program has                    
              been furthered recently by creation of a new faculty position                  
              to provide expertise in ecosystem biogeochemistry and                          
              analytical analysis, and by introduction of two new courses,                   
              Soils and the Environment, and Biogeochemistry.  Both courses                  
              involve field trips for investigation of ecological processes                  
              and sample collection, and laboratory exercises for sample                     
              preparation and instrumental analysis.  An additional and                      
              extremely important component of this program is availability                  
              of instruments for use by students during senior comprehensive                 
              research projects, required of all students.  Completion of                    
              this laboratory through acquisition of a CHN analyzer and an                   
              autoanalyzer is providing direct experience in the use of                      
              modern techniques and analytical instrumentation to perform                    
              process-level analyses of ecosystem and environmental dynamics.                
              The grantee is matching this award from non-Federal sources.
