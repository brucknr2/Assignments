Abstract    :
              In order to provide an industrial-type "design-production-test"                
              experience for students, a  3-axis milling machine with                        
              optional 4th axis, PC, AutoCAD and NC postprocessor are used in                
              a senior-level capstone CAD/CAM course and also in other                       
              manufacturing courses, undergraduate independent study                         
              projects, undergraduate research projects and demonstrations.                  
              In the capstone CAD/CAM course, students use engineering                       
              workstations with solid modeling, FEM, dynamic systems                         
              modeling, expert systems in design for manufacturability, the                  
              milling machine, machine vision inspection and actual dynamic                  
              test to design, produce, inspect and test plate cams.
