Abstract    :
              Since 1986 at the University of Oregon, a curriculum utilizing                 
              Scheme as the programming language in introductory courses for                 
              undergraduate computer science majors has been able to address                 
              a wide range of basic issues.  From this experience, two                       
              fundamental difficulties in teaching the curriculum to liberal                 
              arts students has been identified:  i) the predominantly                       
              preengineering emphasis of available texts, and ii) a lack of                  
              adequate instructional software support.  As a result, a                       
              concept-oriented curriculum and associated Macintosh-based                     
              software environment is being developed.  Students explore                     
              notions of recursion and abstraction as well as complexity and                 
              correctness.  Experience with applications of these ideas is                   
              achieved through lab assignments on such topics as computer                    
              music, color graphics, simple animation, interactive                           
              interfaces, and large-scale program modification.  All on-line                 
              course materials are being developed as MacScheme, ParcPlace                   
              Smalltalk, or MetCom Modula-2 programs and Hypercard stacks.                   
              The lab will contain Macintosh lIci and llfx personal                          
              workstations networked with a Sun SPARCserver for file                         
              management and print services.  Video equipment is being used                  
              as a tool for presentation and preservation of lectures and                    
              results of lab assignments.
