Abstract    :
              This project is equipping a learning laboratory for the                        
              introductory and intermediate level physics laboratory classes                 
              which will encourage active participation by students in the                   
              learning process.  Students have been enthusiastic about the                   
              use of "own-plans" lab projects in the introductory courses.                   
              This approach has led to their engagement with the material and                
              to increased understanding both of the material covered and of                 
              the scientific approach to problem solving.  The equipment                     
              being acquired includes two fully equipped 386-based computer                  
              workstations, each with general purpose AID converter and                      
              various probes; a computer-controlled videodisc system; two                    
              video cam-corders and two computer-assisted video-tape players.                
              This equipment will enable the department to expand on the                     
              "own-plans" idea, extending it to the intermediate laboratory                  
              courses for physics majors, increasing the range of experiments                
              students can do, and exposing them to modern instrumentation                   
              and current methods of data acquisition and analysis.NSF grant                 
              funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
