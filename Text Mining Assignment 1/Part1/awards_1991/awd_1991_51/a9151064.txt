Abstract    :
              To provide students in a required junior level genetics course                 
              with a more meaningful exposure to genetic analysis and                        
              techniques modern molecular technology was introduced in the                   
              laboratory component of this course.  Micropipettors,                          
              microcentrifuges, power supplies, agarose gel apparatuses,                     
              superspeed centrifuges and computers capable of sophisticated                  
              data analysis acquired through the award, are used to introduce                
              students to the use of enzymes in molecular biology and the                    
              creation of recombinant DNA molecules; to agarose gel                          
              electrophoresis as an analytical tool; and to the power of the                 
              computer analysis of both classical and molecular genetic data.                
              The skills acquired by the students in general genetics                        
              laboratory are utilized again in a senior level cell biology                   
              course.
