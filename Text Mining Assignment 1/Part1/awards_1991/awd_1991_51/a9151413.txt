Abstract    :
              This project addresses the need for improved undergraduate                     
              education in digital signal processing through the integration                 
              of practical DSP laboratory experience into the curriculum.                    
              Student learning of digital signal processing concepts at the                  
              undergraduate level is enhanced by introducing the theoretical                 
              and practical considerations together. The DSP Laboratory                      
              consists of ten microcomputer-based DSP "Labstations" assembled                
              using off-the-shelf computers, plug-in DSP coprocessor boards,                 
              analog audio input/output systems, and a mix of commercial and                 
              custom software.  Beginning students use pre-existing software                 
              for experiments and homework assignments, while intermediate                   
              and advanced students actually write programs for the DSP                      
              microprocessor.  Unlike the present situation in undergraduate                 
              engineering education, the students trained in this manner are                 
              directly exposed to the capabilities and limitations of current                
              DSP chips and other hardware, thereby allowing them to design                  
              and implement future DSP applications in the communications and                
              electronics industries in this country.
