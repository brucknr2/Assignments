Abstract    :
              This project establishs a dedicated Computer-Aided-Design                      
              Electronic Laboratory for Electronic Engineering Technology and                
              Computer Technology Programs at Central Michigan University.                   
              The Llaboratory supports the four core course sequence for                     
              these two majors.  The laboratory hardware consists of ten IBM                 
              PS/2-50Z computers, one HP laser printer and five Epson dot                    
              matrix printers.  The software includes PSPICE analog                          
              simulator, OrCAD/EDV digital design package and MS-DOS 4.0.                    
              These facilities are used for practical and complex circuit                    
              analysis, application of advanced design techniques, concept                   
              clarifications, investigation of advanced topics as well as                    
              classroom demonstrations.
