Abstract    :
              Franklin and Marshall College is purchasing a nitrogen pumped                  
              dye laser for use in multiple upper division chemistry courses.                
              Experiments being performed with the new equipment include                     
              laser induced atomic fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence                  
              quenching, and Raman spectroscopy of pure liquids.                             
              Additionally, the laser is used by advanced students in                        
              independent research projects.
