Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a GC-MS for use both                 
              lower and upper division courses.  The equipment is enhancing                  
              the curriculum in the areas of spectroscopy and separations by                 
              application to the identification of complex environmental                     
              samples, such as those found in oil field brine wells.  In                     
              addition to the use of the instrument in formal course                         
              laboratories, students are using in an an active program of                    
              undergraduate research on environmental problems associated                    
              with toxic wastes.
