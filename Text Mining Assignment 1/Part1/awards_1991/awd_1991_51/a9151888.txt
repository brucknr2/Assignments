Abstract    :
              This project is upgrading the Physics of Music Laboratory at                   
              the University of Rochester. To this end, the course is being                  
              changed from a 3-credit preceptorial to a 4-credit course with                 
              full laboratory. The course is open to all students, but 20 are                
              selected based on their music interest and their enthusiasm for                
              understanding the underlying physics. With the increased                       
              laboratory emphasis, more sophisticated individual experiments                 
              (as opposed to demonstrations) are required. In addition, hard                 
              copy of the experimental results is stressed. so that                          
              subsequent detailed analysis can take place.  Through this                     
              project appropriate scientific equipment is being added to the                 
              existing demonstration equipment in the Music Lab.NSF grant                    
              funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
