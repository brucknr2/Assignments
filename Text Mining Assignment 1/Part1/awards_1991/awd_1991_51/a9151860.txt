Abstract    :
              To enrich proposed curricular changes in introductory biology                  
              courses (Principles of General Biology, Honors General Biology,                
              and other courses) a new computer component is being introduced                
              into the laboratory that stresses developing problem-posing,                   
              problem-solving and persuasion skills in beginning scientists.                 
              This computing environment includes MacIntosh IIci computers,                  
              supporting graphics-capable printers, and networking, and                      
              employs BioQUEST software.
