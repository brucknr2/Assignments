Abstract    :
              This project provides opportunities for students to implement                  
              visually realistic, interactive, graphics projects and/or to                   
              experiment with parallel computing concepts.  A laboratory is                  
              established that enables students to gain experience with                      
              modern computer graphics applications that allow two types of                  
              projects to be implemented: (1) advanced rendering via ray-                    
              tracing and (2) hierarchical graphics applications using                       
              SunPHIGS, and allows students to study parallel computing by                   
              implementing their own parallel versions of serial algorithms.                 
              The laboratory consists of a network of four SUN Workstations                  
              with supporting software.
