Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to enable natural science students                 
              in a new introductory course in cell biology and genetics to                   
              reproduce experimental approaches used by researcher scientist                 
              in these disciplines.  The acquisition of a high speed                         
              centrifuge and digital spectrometers allows students to become                 
              more involved in sample preparation, and data acquisition and                  
              analysis.
