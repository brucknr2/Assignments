Abstract    :
              An electronic device laboratory to teach physics and practical                 
              operation of semiconductor electronic devices is being                         
              developed as part of a electronic device course.  This                         
              undergraduate teaching laboratory demonstrates some of the                     
              "difficult to grasp", but "easy to see" notions in                             
              semiconductor device physics.  Starting with experiments to                    
              illustrate the concepts of energy band gap and positively                      
              charged quasi-particles in semiconductors, students progress to                
              examine optical processes and electrical conduction in a                       
              variety of important electronic devices.  These experiments                    
              each are performed in thirty minutes and incorporate state of                  
              the art virtual instrumentation techniques to reduce the time                  
              needed for data acquisition so that the students will have                     
              enough time to carefully perform the experiment and understand                 
              the fundamentals behind the phenomena that they are examining;                 
              a balance is maintained, however, between the ease of use and                  
              pedagogical considerations.
