Abstract    :
              Students are observing that graphs and calculations can suggest                
              theory, which gives rise to more calculations and plotting,                    
              then more theory....   Pre-calculus and calculus students are                  
              using a computer laboratory to capture this interaction between                
              logical proof and empirical observation by using software tools                
              for exploring mathematical modelling and for writing quality                   
              mathematical exposition.  The laboratory contains 17 Macintosh                 
              Classic computers and Calculus T/L software.
