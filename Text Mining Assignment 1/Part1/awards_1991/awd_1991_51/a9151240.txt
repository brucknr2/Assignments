Abstract    :
              Furman University Department is purchasing computers and output                
              devices for use across the chemistry curriculum. Molecular                     
              modeling is being introduced into organic, inorganic and                       
              biological chemistry courses.  Additionally, the computers are                 
              enhancing molecular orbital, statistical mechanics, chemical                   
              kinetic and chemical thermodynamics calculations in physical
