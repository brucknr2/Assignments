Abstract    :
               A Laboratory/Classroom for Computational MathematicsA                         
              laboratory/classroom is being equipped with 20 IBM-55SX                        
              computers for use in a range of upper division mathematics                     
              courses serving the needs of engineering, science, and                         
              mathematics students.  The laboratory, together with an                        
              additional classroom equipped with computer and projection                     
              panel, is providing an environment in which computing becomes                  
              a natural part of the instructional process. Students are                      
              learning to use the computer not only as a numerical engine to                 
              solve problems, but as a mathematical resource which they can                  
              exploit to enhance their own understanding.
