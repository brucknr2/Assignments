Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a high performance                   
              liquid chromatograph for use in both the sophomore majors and                  
              the non-majors organic chemistry sequences. The instrument is                  
              also used in the upper division advanced laboratory courses.                   
              Students in the lower division courses use the instrument to                   
              separate the components of various commercial products. The                    
              theory underlying the technique and the effect of changes in                   
              operating parameters
