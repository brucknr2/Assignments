Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to upgrade and strengthen the                      
              physiology laboratories in Human Anatomy and Physiology through                
              the incorporation of computer-assisted instruction.  Students                  
              are exposed to classical physiological concepts and gain hands-                
              on experience in physiology through the computer interaction.                  
              The software and microcomputers acquired are used to study                     
              basic concepts of respiratory physiology including the                         
              measurement of tidal volume, expiratory reserve volume and                     
              vital capacity, and forced expiratory reserve volume and                       
              comparative data are determined.  Muscle physiology equipment                  
              is used to demonstrate the concepts involved in threshold                      
              stimulus, spatial summation, temporal summation, fatigue effect                
              on contraction and relaxation and the characteristics of a                     
              muscle twitch.  Concepts of cardiac electrophysiology are                      
              demonstrated through ECG measurements and determination of wave                
              patterns, PR, QRS, and QT intervals, and ventricular rates.                    
              Reflex equipment demonstrate concepts involving the reflex arc                 
              of different stretch reflex systems.
