Abstract    :
              The conceptual focus of this project is the design, development                
              and construction of a portable computer-aided data acquisition,                
              analysis and control system (CADAAC System) where the                          
              instrumentation and control capability is appropriate for Fluid                
              and Thermal Science Instructional Laboratories, and where the                  
              system hardware and software has been designed, configured and                 
              packaged with educational instruction in view.  The complete                   
              CADAAC system includes a main computer work station, a                         
              measurement instrumentation module, a control instrumentation                  
              module, and an instrument calibration module. The project                      
              includes the integration of the system into a variety of                       
              experiments within the Fluid and Thermal Science Laboratory.
