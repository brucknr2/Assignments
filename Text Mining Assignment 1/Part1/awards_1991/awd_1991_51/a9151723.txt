Abstract    :
              This project results in an upgrade to a 60 Kip Baldwin Testing                 
              Machine to allow  automated control and data acquisition.  The                 
              laboratory experience will be modified so as to incorporate the                
              teaching of creep in wood beams to sophomore civil engineers.
