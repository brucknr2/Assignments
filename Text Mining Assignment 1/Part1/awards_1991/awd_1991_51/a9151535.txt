Abstract    :
              A series of hands-on laboratory exercises for Astronomy 101-102                
              labs is being developed based on the techniques of digital                     
              image acquisition using CCD cameras and computer aided                         
              analysis.  The laboratories give students hands-on experience                  
              in taking astronomical images and teach various ways in which                  
              they can extract information from these images.  Five core                     
              exercises are being developed initially, with gradual                          
              extensions and additional exercises being added until at least                 
              half of the two dozen laboratory exercises in the two semester                 
              sequence involve new technology.  The following are the initial                
              five core exercises (1) An Introduction to Digital Imaging, (2)                
              Lunar Surface Features, (3) Light Curve of a Variable Star, (4)                
              HR Diagram of M67, and (5) Images of Galaxies.  Emphasis is be                 
              on student participation and the full utilization of current                   
              image collection and processing as provided by a cooled CCD                    
              camera and supporting computer and electronics hardware.
