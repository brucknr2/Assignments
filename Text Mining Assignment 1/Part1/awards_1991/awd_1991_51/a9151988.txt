Abstract    :
               A laboratory containing a flexible configuration of parallel                  
              processors for use in an upper level seminar in parallel                       
              processing is being established.  The laboratory explores                      
              parallel algorithms and their relation to various connection                   
              topologies.  Transputer systems are used because they lend                     
              themselves to empirical studies of the speedup of parallel                     
              algorithms under varying conditions and are easily configured                  
              into a variety of different topologies.  The equipment                         
              initially is used in an upper level seminar.  The algorithms to                
              be explored in the seminar are chosen with care, so that                       
              experience gained in the seminar can translate into useful                     
              units of study in parallel algorithms in most of the computer                  
              science courses in subsequent years.
