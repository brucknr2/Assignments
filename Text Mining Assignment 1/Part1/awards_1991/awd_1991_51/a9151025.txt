Abstract    :
              A computer classroom/laboratory is being used to allow students                
              to examine topics from a geometric point of view whenever                      
              possible.  Students are using the computer and their intuition                 
              to develop an understanding of concepts and to discover                        
              theorems.  When analytic methods fail to yield a closed form                   
              solution, numerical methods are used to obtain an approximate                  
              solution.  Students are shown, in small doses, how to use the                  
              True Basic programming language and are required to write                      
              programs to accomplish a wide range of meaningful tasks.                       
              Unisys Personal Workstations running True Basic and Derive are                 
              the principal tools in the laboratory.
