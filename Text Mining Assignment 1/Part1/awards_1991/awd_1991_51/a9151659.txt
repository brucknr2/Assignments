Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are to improve student access to                     
              computer-based techniques for data collection, analysis, and                   
              modeling for majors and non-majors in biology, chemistry, and                  
              physics laboratories.  The computer facilities are also used by                
              upper-level students conducting laboratory research, and in the                
              development of new computer-based curriculum materials for                     
              classes in physiology, ecology, and marine biology.
