Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology and Geography modernizing the                        
              existing x-ray diffraction and fluorescence of a dual                          
              goniometer and detector upgrade to provide instruction in these                
              techniques to upper level geology students in mineralogy,                      
              petrology and geochemistry courses.  Additionally, the                         
              facilities are being used by advanced chemistry and physics                    
              students enrolled in an interdisciplinary course designed to                   
              provide hands-on experience in powder X-ray diffraction and                    
              fluorescence spectrometry.  Students performing undergraduate                  
              research employ they instrument in their investigations of                     
              fundamental physical and chemical principles underlying                        
              geological phenomena.
