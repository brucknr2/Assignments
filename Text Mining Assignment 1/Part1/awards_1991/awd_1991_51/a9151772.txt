Abstract    :
              The Computer Science faculty at New Mexico Highlands University                
              has developed degree programs in Computer Science and Computer                 
              Information Systems that meet the needs of largely, under-                     
              represented students.  These students are highly motivated but                 
              have been poor foudations in problem solving, internal model                   
              development, and abstraction skills - all important in                         
              understanding the concepts of Computer Science.  This project                  
              augments the present curriculum in Computer Science and                        
              Computer Information Systems by adding computer laboratories to                
              a number of the courses.  For each laboratory, exercises and                   
              computational experiments are being developed to help the                      
              students realize the abstractions they find so difficult.  The                 
              goal is to allow more students to graduate with strong computer                
              science backgrounds and a sense of confidence.
