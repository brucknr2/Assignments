Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to integrate speech science                     
              laboratory experiences with basic speech science course-work to                
              promote active learning of the physiological processes of                      
              speech production and their relation to the acoustic speech                    
              signal.  Laboratory activities have been designed to encourage                 
              investigation of speech processes and to involve undergraduate                 
              students in the method of scientific inquiry.  A computerized                  
              speech lab is requested to enable students to examine the                      
              acoustic speech signal.  Additional scientific equipment is                    
              requested to afford students the opportunity to objectively                    
              measure and quantify the various speech processes including                    
              respiration, phonation, and articulation.  Through the proposed                
              speech laboratory investigations, students will be able to                     
              enhance their understanding of the intricate relationships                     
              between speech physiological processes, to develop their skills                
              in scientific methodology, and to increase their level of                      
              preparation for future graduate study.
