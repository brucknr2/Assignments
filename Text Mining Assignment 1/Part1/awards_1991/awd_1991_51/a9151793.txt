Abstract    :
              This project provides the necessary instrumentation to provide                 
              a comprehensive laboratory experience for an on-going course on                
              Colloidal and Interfacial Phenomena. The instrumentation                       
              consists of a laser light scattering apparatus, a                              
              wetting/contact angle instrument, a centrifuge for colloidal                   
              size analysis, an automated capillary viscometer and a film                    
              balance. This instrumentation allows inclusion of experiments                  
              in the important areas of light scattering, spread monolayers                  
              and wetting/contact angle phenomena while improving the                        
              experiments concerned with colloid rheology and surface tension                
              phenomena.  The resulting course provides a model for the                      
              enrichment of elective chemical engineering courses and the                    
              resulting course materials will be disseminated via national                   
              meetings and publications.
