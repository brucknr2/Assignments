Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to improve the teaching of                        
              microbiology by introducing the study of animal viruses into                   
              virology-immunology laboratories at this institution with a                    
              large hispanic student population.  The purchase of CO2                        
              incubators, tissue culture enclosures, tissue culture                          
              microscopes and an EIA microtitration plate reader allows                      
              animal virus to be cultured and detected.
