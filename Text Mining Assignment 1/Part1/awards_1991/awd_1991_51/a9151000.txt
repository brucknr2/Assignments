Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to use a single enzyme system,                     
              dihydrofolate reductase, as the basis for a variety of                         
              experiments in a new biochemistry laboratory course for non-                   
              majors, and in the modernization of an advanced course for                     
              majors.  Using a cloned gene as an abundant source of an enzyme                
              that plays an important role in cancer chemotherapy, enzyme                    
              mechanisms, gene amplification and molecular evolution allows                  
              students to learn a wide range of techniques and provides                      
              continuity to the exercises.  The spectrophotometer,                           
              centrifuges, fractionator, and electrophoresis equipment allow                 
              students to learn protein purification, enzyme kinetics,                       
              immunoblotting, ultraviolet difference spectrophotometry,                      
              plasmid isolation, restriction mapping, and DNA sequencing.
