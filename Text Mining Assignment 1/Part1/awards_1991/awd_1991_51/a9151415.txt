Abstract    :
              A 200 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectrometer for                    
              carbon and hydrogen nuclei will make possible improvement of                   
              instruction across the chemistry curriculum.  New instruction                  
              will occur in organic, analytical, and physical chemistry                      
              laboratories, and the undergraduate research program will be                   
              enhanced.  Modern techniques for structure elucidation,                        
              analysis of complex mixtures, and studies of dynamical                         
              processes in solid and liquid phases will be taught.  The                      
              grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
