Abstract    :
              Calculus students are enhancing their mathematics education                    
              through the use of a computer laboratory equipped with IBM PS/2                
              computers running Mathematica.  This mathematical tool will be                 
              used throughout their college careers.  The laboratory is used                 
              by the calculus students in guided laboratory sessions designed                
              to reinforce and augment the topics being covered in lecture.                  
              The laboratory is available on a drop-in basis to any student                  
              who has completed the calculus sequence.
