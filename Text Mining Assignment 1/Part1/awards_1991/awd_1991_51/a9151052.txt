Abstract    :
              Students are experiencing important statistical activities of                  
              sample selection, data collection, experimental design,                        
              randomization, development of statistical models, in a newly                   
              developed laboratory course taken in conjunction with their first              
              undergraduate statistics course. In doing so, they are gaining a               
              firm understanding of the role of applied statistics in scientific             
              investigations and the type or work that professional statisticians            
              do.  The lab guides the student through simple, but meaningful,                
              experiments which illustrate important concepts from applied                   
              statistics.  In each session, the students discuss and perform an              
              experiment, collect and use computers to analyze the data, and                 
              write a report.
