Abstract    :
                    Northland College is purchasing an ion analysis HPLC                     
              system for use in several courses focusing on soil and water                   
              chemistry. There is an emphasis on the influence of acid rain                  
              and global warming on soil nitrogen mineralization and metal                   
              ion leaching.
