Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to establish an integrated set of                  
              experiments addressing the light reactions of photosynthesis                   
              across three appropriate courses:  introductory biology,                       
              introductory botany, and plant physiology.  These experiments                  
              introduce the subject at appropriate levels of theoretical and                 
              mechanical sophistication for the intended student groups, at                  
              an institution that has the largest teacher education program                  
              in the state.  The Spectrophotometers, orbital shaker and                      
              rotary evaporator allow experiments that include measuring                     
              photosynthetic rates at different light intensities,                           
              wavelengths, and temperatures using chloroplast suspensions and                
              whole cell cultures.  They also include obtaining absorption                   
              spectra from chloroplast suspensions and separated pigments.
