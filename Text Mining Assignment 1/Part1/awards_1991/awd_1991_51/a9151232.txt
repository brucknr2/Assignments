Abstract    :
              This project develops a microcomputer laboratory to be used for                
              undergraduate mathematics courses and advanced undergraduate                   
              courses in computer science.  Students in Calculus and Linear                  
              Algebra will become acquainted with a computer algebra system,                 
              such as MAPLE.  The use of this system continues in subsequent                 
              mathematics courses and, hopefully, in the professional                        
              practice of mathematics.  The first course in calculus is                      
              augmented by a computer laboratory course carrying one hour                    
              credit.  Computer science students use the new equipment                       
              especially in courses in Object-Oriented Programming, Graphics,                
              and Operating Systems.  Software to be run includes OBJECTIVE                  
              C, C + + and SMALLTALK V.The equipment includes 16                             
              microcomputers of 486 type networked to a LAN running the UNIX                 
              operating system.  In addition, there are three mobil overhead                 
              work stations equipped with computers and LCD projection pads                  
              for classroom instructional use.
