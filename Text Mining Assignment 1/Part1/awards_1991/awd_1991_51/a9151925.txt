Abstract    :
              This project enables coordinating the teaching of physics and                  
              mathematics via the use of common software and hardware                        
              systems.   The project introduces a common computer laboratory                 
              for the large number of students enrolled in both General                      
              Physics and Calculus.  A coordinating group from the                           
              Departments of Physics and Mathematics has been established to                 
              develop a unified pedagogical approach.  a unified                             
              technological approach will be used which includes a common                    
              computer system, common software systems such as Mathematica                   
              and 20/20, a common graphical system, and common text                          
              processing systems.  The coordinating group is  overseeing the                 
              introduction of topics, the development of appropriate                         
              techniques, and the assessment of the efficacy of the methods                  
              chosen.  The initial emphasis in physics is in the  development                
              of new approaches for the teaching of general physics                          
              laboratory while in mathematics the emphasis is on the                         
              development of computer based methods of teaching the calculus.                
              Following these, the approach will be applied to instruction in                
              the mathematical methods of physics and differential equations.                
              It is expected that the systems and methods introduced at each                 
              stage in the project will be applicable in all succeeding                      
              courses in both departments.
