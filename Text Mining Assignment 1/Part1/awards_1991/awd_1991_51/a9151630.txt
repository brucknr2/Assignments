Abstract    :
              The proposal will allow for the purchase of eight physiology                   
              laboratory stations. Each station will consist of an IBM PC,                   
              dot matrix printer, hardware (stimulator, cables, electrodes,                  
              etc.) and software to demonstrate muscle physiology                            
              (physiogrip), reflex arc physiology (flexicomp),                               
              electrocardiography (spirocomp) which will use the students as                 
              laboratory subjects.The project will allow us to expand and                    
              improve our coverage of physiology in the laboratory.  It will                 
              also allow us to reinforce the physiological principles taught                 
              in lectures.  Perhaps most importantly we will achieve these                   
              goals without the expense, animal housing, and ethical problems                
              inherent in traditional animal (frog and turtle) based                         
              laboratory procedures.
