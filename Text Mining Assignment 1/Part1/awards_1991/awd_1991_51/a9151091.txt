Abstract    :
              A laboratory containing DECstations 3100 running ULTRIX  is                    
              being used to support a new course, Numerical Methods for                      
              Supercomputers.  Students are learning to design programs that                 
              exploit vector and parallel architectures, submitting jobs to                  
              a remote supercomputer, and in their home-campus lab they are                  
              synthesizing large quantities of output data into an animated                  
              graphical display.  By focusing on the last stage of the                       
              modeling process - interpretation - students are learning to                   
              evaluate the solutions to their mathematical and numerical                     
              models so that they become familiar with the entire modeling                   
              process.
