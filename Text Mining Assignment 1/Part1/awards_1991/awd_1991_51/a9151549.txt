Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology is purchasing sample preparation and                 
              computing equipment to be used by students  for chemical and                   
              mineralogical analyses of geologic materials as part of                        
              laboratory exercises and undergraduate research projects. This                 
              equipment is increasing the utility of existing  X-ray                         
              diffractometers in Clay Mineralogy, X-ray Techniques, and                      
              Sedimentology/Stratigraphy laboratory courses. The equipment is                
              also being used extensively in undergraduate research projects                 
              on stream and river sediments, soil formation processes, and                   
              hydrothermal alteration of dike-intruded sediments.
