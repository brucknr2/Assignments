Abstract    :
              Students studying mathematics, science and mathematics                         
              education are learning by solving problems in a supervised                     
              laboratory equipped with 25 high performance networked Apple                   
              Macintosh micro computers and appropriate software. Designed to                
              increase student interest and productivity, this laboratory                    
              exercises students' mathematical thought processes in specially                
              created learning environments.  Particular emphasis is placed                  
              on using high level languages to extend the "microworld"                       
              approach, pioneered by Seymour Papert, to solving problems.
