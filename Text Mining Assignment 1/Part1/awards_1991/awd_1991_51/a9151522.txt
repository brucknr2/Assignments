Abstract    :
              In many small colleges, one physics instructor is called upon                  
              to teach several different levels of introductory physics.                     
              There generally are not enough students to justify offering                    
              parallel lecture style classes at a given time to students with                
              varying calculus proficiency.Workshop Physics is a teaching                    
              system in which students build their own understanding of                      
              physics by direct interaction with phenomena.  Traditional                     
              lectures are replaced by guided hands-on activities for                        
              students working in small groups.   Microcomputers interfaced                  
              with laboratory equipment allow for real-time measurements and                 
              immediate interpretation of results by the students.This                       
              project is resulting in an instructional design in which both                  
              calculus-based and non-calculus students learn physics in the                  
              same classroom/laboratory at the same time with one teacher                    
              using The Workshop Physics approach.   Improved learning and                   
              better use of instructional resources are the outcomes.NSF                     
              grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal                      
              sources.
