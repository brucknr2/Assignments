Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology is purchasing equipment to                           
              restructure the introductory physical geology laboratories                     
              around an earth systems theme. This innovative approach                        
              involves 1 to 4-week field exercises, rather than traditional                  
              laboratory experiments on isolated topics. Each theme                          
              illustrates the complex relationships among seemingly disparate
