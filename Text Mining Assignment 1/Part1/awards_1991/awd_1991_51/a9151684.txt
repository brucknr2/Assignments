Abstract    :
              This project is utilizing infrared thermographic imaging as a                  
              key tool in teaching concepts of thermodynamics to majors and                  
              non-majors in physics, chemistry, and biology courses.                         
              Equipment purchased with grant funds is capable of resolving                   
              temperature differences of 0.1 centigrade degrees in the range                 
              from -20 C to 280 C.  Thermographic imaging is enabling                        
              students to visualize energy relationships and to understand                   
              the laws of thermo-dynamics, thermal properties of matter, and                 
              energy transfer in living things.  While useful in a variety of                
              courses, the equipment is central to a new course "Foundations                 
              of Physics and Chemistry" which is a prerequisite to General                   
              Chemistry and General Physics courses at Catawba College.NSF                   
              grant funds are being matched by funds from non-Federal                        
              sources.
