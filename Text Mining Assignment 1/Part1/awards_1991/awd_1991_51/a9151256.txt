Abstract    :
                Introduction of UV-VIS Diode Array Spectrophotometry in the                  
              Chemistry Curriculum    A UV-VIS diode array spectrophotometer                 
              with a temperature controlled cell compartment, PC, monitor,                   
              printer and two software packages will be used in general                      
              chemistry and organic chemistry courses.  This will upgrade the                
              quality and quantity of spectroscopy based experiments in the                  
              laboratories.   The instrument will also be extensively used in                
              upper division courses.  Theory and practice of UV-VIS diode                   
              array analysis will be introduced in Analytical Chemistry and                  
              more fully developed in Instrumental Methods, Advanced                         
              Laboratory Techniques, Advanced Inorganic, and student research                
              courses.  The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal                
              sources.
