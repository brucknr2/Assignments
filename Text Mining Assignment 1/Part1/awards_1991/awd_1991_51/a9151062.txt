Abstract    :
              This project will incorporate use of an FTIR spectrophotometer                 
              into laboratory courses in organic chemistry, instrumental                     
              analysis, analytical chemistry, advanced synthetic techniques,                 
              physical measurements, and biochemistry, and an active                         
              undergraduate research program.  The planned uses include                      
              exploitation of the computer-intensive data handling capability                
              of the instrument as well as special uses such as the study of                 
              thin films and solids by use of photoacoustic spectroscopy and                 
              grazing angle techniques.  The grantee will match the NSF award                
              from non-Federal sources.
