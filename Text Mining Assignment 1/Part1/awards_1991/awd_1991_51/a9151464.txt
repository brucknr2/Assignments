Abstract    :
              The equipment in this project is being used in a popular upper                 
              division physical optics laboratory course; "Modern                            
              Experimental Optics."  Students are performing fourteen                        
              experiments in physical optics, interferometry, optical                        
              modulation and heterodyning, laser physics, and time-resolved                  
              spectroscopy, but the equipment is mostly generic, having wide                 
              utility beyond these particular applications.  Individual items                
              of significant cost include two optical tables, a home-built                   
              nitrogen laser, an electro-optic modulator, and a fast analog                  
              data-acquisition system.In general, the experiments require                    
              students to assemble an optical system from components, see                    
              phenomena they have read about, and use the phenomena to make                  
              a physical measurement.  For example, in a study of Fabry-Perot                
              interferometers, the students start with a HeNe laser, a few                   
              mirrors and lenses, mounts, and a piezo-electric translator and                
              come out at the end with a sensitive reflectivity value for the                
              low-loss mirrors used in the interferometer.Most of the                        
              experiments are based on the Principal Investigator's                          
              experiences as a postdoc and in industry; in general, they have                
              not been discussed in the literature.  Consequently, they are                  
              being published as papers or laboratory manuals for those                      
              projects which turn out to be most useful as teaching tools.
