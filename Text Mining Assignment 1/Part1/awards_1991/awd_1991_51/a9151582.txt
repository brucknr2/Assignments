Abstract    :
              This project will introduce the technique of High Performance                  
              Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) into the chemistry curriculum at                  
              the sophomore level as a part of two courses in analytical                     
              chemistry.  Three identical HPLC's configured for isocratic                    
              operation and UV detection will be used.  These uses complement                
              existing gas chromatographic, infrared, UV-VIS, and                            
              electrochemical techniques already in these courses for                        
              chemistry and other science majors.  Exposure to this valuable                 
              technique will serve as the basis for expanded HPLC usage in                   
              junior-senior level courses such as biochemistry, physical                     
              chemistry, and advanced inorganic laboratories.  The grantee                   
              will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
