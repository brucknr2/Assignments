Abstract    :
              This project will improve the quality of the organic chemistry                 
              course.  A Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometerand a 60                
              MHz proton NMR spectrometer will allow curricular changes.  The                
              organic chemistry course will be expanded to four hours lecture                
              per week from the current three, enrollment in Independent                     
              Study by students planning a chemistry major will be                           
              encouraged, and a second introductory chemistry course that                    
              will use instrumentation will be developed.  Expanding the                     
              organic lecture by thirty two hours per year will increase the                 
              topics covered, including structure elucidation by                             
              spectroscopic means.  The grantee will match the NSF award from                
              non-Federal sources.
