Abstract    :
              Modern scientific investigation is highly instrumented, with                   
              computers playing a major role in most of experimental science                 
              and much of the theoretical, as well.  The introductory courses                
              in physics, besides teaching basic physics and problem solving,                
              should give the student an introduction to the way that                        
              scientists work and the modern instrumentation that is used.                   
              Because of budget constraints, however, it is difficult for a                  
              physics department to move out of the laboratory mode developed                
              in the late l960s and early 70s into an instrumented laboratory                
              environment, but it is nonetheless important to do so.  This                   
              project is helping the Indiana State University Physics                        
              Department make that leap by instrumenting the introductory                    
              laboratories with computers interfaced to a variety of                         
              equipment to help students in data taking and analysis. The                    
              project is providing computers and interfaces to instrument 12                 
              lab stations to be used in both the calculus-based, and non-                   
              calculus physics courses. Along with well-designed laboratory                  
              exercises, the proposed instrumentation is making possible a                   
              significantly enhanced experience for students in the two                      
              introductory physics courses.NSF funds are being matched with                  
              funds from non-federal sources.
