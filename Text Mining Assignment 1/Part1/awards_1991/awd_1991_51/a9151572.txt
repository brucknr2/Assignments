Abstract    :
              Students understanding of mathematical concepts are being                      
              enhanced by the integration of a calculator-based laboratory                   
              into the curriculum for all the course sequences from                          
              elementary algebra through calculus. The TI 81 graphics                        
              calculators help students exploit the connection between                       
              graphical and algebraic representations.
