Abstract    :
              A computer component is being introduced into the mulitvariable                
              calculus and differential equations courses. Students are                      
              gaining insights afforded by newly developed graphics software,                
              are empowered with the ability to use computer algebra systems                 
              for numeric and symbolic computation, are experimenting with                   
              vector fields and their associated flows, and are visually                     
              investigating examples that illustrate the theory of vector                    
              analysis and Fourier approximations.
