Abstract    :
              Macintosh computers are being used as tools for active                         
              investigation in two different and innovative courses:                         
              MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS AND MATHEMATlCA for upper division                      
              mathematics majors and MODELING AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD                      
              (using STELLA II software) for freshman and sophomore non-                     
              science majors. Students use computers to gain insight into                    
              mathematical problems through graphical representation and use                 
              modeling as the basis for discovery of basic principles common                 
              to all science disciplines.  The software allows students to                   
              investigate real world problems previously inaccessible using                  
              only paper, pencil, and calculator.
