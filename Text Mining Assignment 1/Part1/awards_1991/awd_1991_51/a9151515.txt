Abstract    :
              This project targets the vital expansion of a CAD/CAM program                  
              into the area of designing and manufacturing with plastic                      
              components.  The system is integrated with the existing                        
              flexible manufacturing system (FMS) facility to provide a                      
              comprehensive undergraduate CAD/CAM capability.  This project's                
              specific goals are to provide undergraduate students with                      
              hands-on experience of microprocessor controlled plastic                       
              injection molding systems.  This adds a totally new and up-to-                 
              date dimension to the undergraduate curriculum.  The system, a                 
              BOY 50M, allows small thermoplastic components to be produced,                 
              either automatically, when interfaced to the FMS, or manually,                 
              when operated as a stand-alone system.
