Abstract    :
              The Shannon Point Marine Center is purchasing a state-of-the-                  
              art image analysis system.  Undergraduate students are using                   
              the system to quantitatively study processes at the organismal,                
              population, and community levels. Included among the ongoing                   
              studies are study predator/prey interactions, invertebrate                     
              larval behavior, morphometries, and ethnic community structure.                
              The equipment is also used for undergraduate student research
