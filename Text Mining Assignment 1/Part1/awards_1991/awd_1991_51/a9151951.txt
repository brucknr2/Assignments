Abstract    :
              A new undergraduate sequence in Dynamical Systems is being                     
              developed and selected topics from dynamics are being                          
              introduced into existing courses in Differential Equations,                    
              Geometry, and Analysis.  The new course and affected courses                   
              make extensive use of a new dedicated computer graphics                        
              laboratory.  This laboratory enables students to experiment                    
              with dynamics and in particular explore boundaries and domains                 
              of attraction, and Mandelbrot and Julia sets.  The laboratory                  
              includes 6 80386-based PC's, one 80386-SX PC laptop for                        
              classroom and outside presentations, and a laser printer.
