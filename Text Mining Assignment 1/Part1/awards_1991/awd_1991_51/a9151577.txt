Abstract    :
              The Chemistry department is purchasing an automated polarimeter                
              for use in several upper division courses. Students are using                  
              the instrument to study the kinetics of disaccharide hydrolysis                
              and of the racemization of optically active transition metal                   
              complexes. Stereoselectivity of various synthetic reageants are                
              being investigated in the advanced organic chemistry                           
              laboratory. It is also being used by undergraduate students                    
              conducting independent research.
