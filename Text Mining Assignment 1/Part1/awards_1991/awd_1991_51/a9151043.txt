Abstract    :
              This project is adding a solid-state photon detector-system to                 
              an existing nuclear laboratory course reguired for senior                      
              physics majors. Reasons for integrating this instrument into                   
              the senior course are:(1)  It is now a widely used and often                   
              preferred photon detector because of its good energy resolution                
              and affordable cost.  (2)  It enables the students to learn the                
              technigue of "Proton Induced X-ray Emission" (PIXE) for non-                   
              destructive trace element detection.  This technique                           
              supplements Rutherford backscattering (RBS) and Neutron                        
              Activation Analysis (NAA) another two important non-destructive                
              analytical techniques which are already taught in the course.                  
              (3)  Together with the existing Nal(Tl) photon detection                       
              system, it allows the students to learn the technique of                       
              determining the absolute activity of a radioactive source by                   
              gamma-gamma coincidence measurement.  (4)  Students learn to                   
              use fast-timing electronics and coincidence techniques, and to                 
              program PC-based multichannel analyzers.  The addition of the                  
              proposed equipment makes this course essentially complete for                  
              learning radiation measurement techniques and introductory                     
              applied nuclear technologies.  NSF grant funds are being                       
              matched with funds from non-federal sources.
