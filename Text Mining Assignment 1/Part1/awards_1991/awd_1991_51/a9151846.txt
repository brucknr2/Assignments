Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to provide the essential practical                
              counterparts to lectures, textbooks, and the primary research                  
              literature relevant to the study of proteins and nucleic acids.                
              The liquid chromatography system and a scintillation counter                   
              acquired are used to introduce students to these instruments in                
              the context of structured laboratory investigations in                         
              intermediate and advanced courses.  Subsequently, students are                 
              given the opportunity to integrate their literature-based and                  
              practical knowledge in the design and performance of                           
              independent research projects that incorporate chromatographic                 
              methods and use of radioisotopes.
