Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to expand the laboratory                           
              experiences for undergraduates in molecular biology and                        
              recombinant DNA technology.  An ultra-low temperature freezer,                 
              microcentrifuge, vacuum oven, gel apparatus and power supplies                 
              are being used in new lab exercises include large scale plasmid                
              isolation, DNA cloning, Southern blot analysis, restriction                    
              site mapping, SDS-poly-acrylamide gel electrophoreses,                         
              submarine gel electrophoresis and sucrose gradient                             
              ultracentrifugation.
