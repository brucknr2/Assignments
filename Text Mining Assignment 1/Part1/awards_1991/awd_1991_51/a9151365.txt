Abstract    :
              This project entails the addition of a mass spectrometer, a gas                
              chromatograph, and a particle beam LC/MS interface to an                       
              existing liquid chromatograph, a data station, and a NBS/NIST                  
              spectral library for spectra comparison.  Additional hardware                  
              is needed to interface the system.  The new instrument array                   
              will upgrade undergraduate laboratory instruction and student                  
              research opportunities at lower and upper levels.  Students                    
              will be shown the new system in freshman courses; will be given                
              mass spectra exercises in intermediate Organic Chemistry I                     
              laboratory; will experience some hands-on instrument                           
              instruction in Organic Chemistry II laboratory; and will obtain                
              further training in senior level inorganic, instrumental                       
              analysis, and biochemistry laboratory courses.  Many students                  
              will use the techniques so learned in multi-disciplinary                       
              research projects, including an extensive program in                           
              limnological studies.  The grantee will overmatch the NSF award                
              by four-fold from non-Federal sources.
