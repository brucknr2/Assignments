Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is (1) to develop a new, hands-on,                    
              experimental-technique laboratory course in biotechnology; (2)                 
              to integrate advanced computer analysis and simulation with the                
              wet-bench exercises of the biotechnology course; (3) to add                    
              advanced biotechnology capability to our strong undergraduate                  
              research program; and (4) to add molecular biology equipment                   
              and technology to existing course laboratories.  The request                   
              includes laboratory equipment to conduct exercises                             
              demonstrating electroporation, the polymerase chain reaction,                  
              electrophoresis, micropipetting, bacterial and tissue culture,                 
              centrifugation, DNA hybridization, and DNA sequencing. The                     
              computer software and hardware will be used for the analysis of                
              protein and nucleic acid sequences, and for simulation of                      
              molecular biology manipulations.
