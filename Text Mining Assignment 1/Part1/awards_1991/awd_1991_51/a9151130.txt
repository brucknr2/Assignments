Abstract    :
              A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer with multiple                   
              internal reflectance accessory, diffuse reflectance accessory,                 
              and associated software will be used primarily in instrumental,                
              organic, and physical chemistry courses.  It will also be used                 
              in first year chemistry to introduce students to computerized                  
              data acquisition and processing, and in biochemistry to                        
              investigate the infrared spectra of biomolecules.  The grantee                 
              will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
