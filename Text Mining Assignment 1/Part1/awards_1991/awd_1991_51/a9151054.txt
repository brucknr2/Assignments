Abstract    :
              Microcomputer-based laboratory workstations are used for data                  
              acquisition and analysis in the laboratory experiments of                      
              beginning Physics courses for non-majors.  These courses reach                 
              200 to 300 students every semester, including a large number of                
              education majors.
