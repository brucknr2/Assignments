Abstract    :
              Th3 department of Chemistry is purchasing a Fourier Transform                  
              Infrared (FT-IR) Spectrophotometer for use throughout the                      
              undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  The instrument is enabling                
              undergraduates to study theoretical and instrumental aspects of                
              infrared spectroscopy as well as data analysis concepts.                       
              Advanced students are cooperatively developing new experiments                 
              with the faculty and undertaking independent research projects                 
              with the aid of the new equipment.The FT-IR spectrometers and                  
              associated work-stations will allow a full compliment of modern                
              spectroscopic training to be offered to Viterbo students.  Not                 
              only will relevant technical expertise be gained by our                        
              chemistry, biology and pre-professional students but important                 
              knowledge about one of the most powerful analytical techniques                 
              will be gained by our non-science students.  This experience,                  
              combined with a strong curriculum, will keep our students                      
              competitive for future work in industrial/government                           
              laboratories, teaching or graduate school.
