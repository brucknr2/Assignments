Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this new Lasers & Spectroscopy Laboratory                  
              is to strengthen the intermediate and advanced laboratory                      
              experiments so as to bridge the gap between strong introductory                
              course laboratories and required senior research projects.                     
              This project involves the overhaul of laboratory experiments                   
              for the Introduction to Modern Physics course and the Advanced                 
              Physics Laboratory for juniors.  The advanced laboratory must                  
              cover topics in Electricity & Magnetism, Modern Optics, and                    
              Solid State Physics.  The current project concentrates on the                  
              optics and spectroscopy aspects of the two intermediate                        
              laboratory courses.  The theme is a lasers and spectroscopy                    
              teaching laboratory consisting of four experimental multi-                     
              purpose stations.  An emphasis on optics has pedagogical                       
              advantages in such a laboratory.  The experiments will also                    
              strengthen the preparation of students for their senior                        
              research project.  Components for each of the experimental                     
              stations are being assembled, tested, and evaluated by senior                  
              students and faculty prior to their integration into the new                   
              laboratories.  Some existing equipment will be incorporated                    
              into the new laboratory.
