Abstract    :
              The development of this interdisciplinary knowledge engineering                
              laboratory for undergraduate students at Luther College fills                  
              a role for the Department of Computer Science as it relates to                 
              the needs of a liberal arts college.  The laboratory provides                  
              hardware and software support for the study and construction of                
              expert systems in both traditional and nontraditional                          
              application domains.  The resulting environment provides an                    
              arena in which computer science students work directly with                    
              students majoring in other disciplines on joint projects.                      
              Students are encouraged to work both independently and in                      
              knowledge engineering teams under the direction of an                          
              interdisciplinary faculty steering committee.  The laboratory                  
              takes advantage of the strong interdisciplinary interests of                   
              the students who attend Luther College and provides computer                   
              science students with an opportunity to interact with students                 
              from other disciplines.
