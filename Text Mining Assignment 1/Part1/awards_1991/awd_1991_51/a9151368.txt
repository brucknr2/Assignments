Abstract    :
              Students are learning calculus in an integrated computational                  
              environment that supports full student and faculty use of a                    
              Computer Algebra System (we plan to use DRIVE) and other                       
              relevant software in classrooms and in a dedicated mathematics                 
              laboratory.  The project is to fostering "learning by                          
              discovery", enlivening the teaching of calculus, and making                    
              students active participants rather than passive observers by                  
              providing guided learning experiences that both challenges and                 
              engages them.
