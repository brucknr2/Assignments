Abstract    :
              A growing trend in chemical engineering curricula in the past                  
              decade has been the introduction of biochemical engineering                    
              into undergraduate laboratory courses. A biotechnology                         
              laboratory that incorporates studies in microbial fermentation                 
              kinetics, enzymology, biochemical reactor analysis, and                        
              bioseparation techniques is included in the chemical                           
              engineering curriculum to acquaint undergraduates with these                   
              important experimental methods. Equipment in this laboratory                   
              includes a batch/continuous fermenter, an ultrafiltration                      
              system, chromatography and spectrophotometry units, and devices                
              to monitor cell growth such as densitometers and dissolved                     
              oxygen and pH probes. Such a laboratory exposes undergraduate                  
              students in chemical engineering to many important aspects of                  
              the new and emerging technology that biotechnology represents.
