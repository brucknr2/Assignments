Abstract    :
              A laboratory is being developed for teaching two concentration                 
              courses: Computer Organization and Principles of Design for                    
              Large Systems.  The laboratory consists of a network of three                  
              NeXT workstations, with an additional workstation for faculty                  
              development work.  The new lab uses a combination of the C                     
              programming language, with its low-level features, together                    
              with MC68040 assembly code in the Computer Organization course.                
              Simulators are used to work with microcoding and I/O and                       
              interrupt facilities.  The new equipment enables the use of                    
              UNIX tools for controlling the development of large projects.                  
              In the Design course, C++, which comes with the NeXT, is used                  
              to introduce and provide the facilities of object-oriented                     
              programming in the design process.  By having the workstations                 
              connected via an ethernet, students are better able to                         
              coordinate their work for large system design projects.  A new                 
              course, Computer Modeling: A Tool for the Mind is being                        
              developed.  In this course, the computational speed and the                    
              accessible user interface of the NeXT enables the non-science                  
              students to be introduced to the important current applications                
              of computer science such as artificial intelligence, cognitive                 
              science, chaos theory, and, in general, the "information                       
              processing" paradigm for thought.
