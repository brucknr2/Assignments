Abstract    :
              A  senior-level laboratory in semiconductor materials and                      
              device fabrication is being developed to provide hands-on                      
              experience with abstract concepts obtained two semiconductor                   
              device and one optical electronics courses.  The experiments                   
              center on (1) semiconductor/metal film deposition,(2)                          
              semiconductor processing and characterization, an (3) simple                   
              device formation.  The laboratory also supports an                             
              undergraduate honors course which has an independent student                   
              research component culminating in a required article, abstract                 
              submission, or senior thesis.  The laboratory provides                         
              practical experience, including computerized data acquisition,                 
              with the fundamental material aspects of semiconductors.                       
              Innovative aspects include (1) in-class electro- and                           
              "electroless" deposition of most metal chalcogenide films to be                
              utilize and (2) a "team-within-a-team" concept where 2-3 person                
              teams symbiotically coordinate with other teams to complete                    
              projects.  Major items of equipment include an x-ray                           
              diffractometer (phase and grain size determination), a                         
              UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer for optical absorption/reflectance                
              spectroscopy (band-gap and free carrier determination),                        
              electromagnet and computerized data acquisition system for Hall                
              and van der Pauw measurements, annealing oven (annealing and                   
              contact firing), microbalance (thickness determination),                       
              diamond wire saw (sample shaping), bell jar evaporation system                 
              (contact deposition), monochromator system (photoconductivity,                 
              photo-current, and luminescence spectra), and capacitance-                     
              voltage meter/curve trace (both for junction/contact                           
              characterization).
