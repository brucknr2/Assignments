Abstract    :
              A three-axis numerically controlled mill and a computer-aided                  
              manufacturing system is integrated with an existing computer-                  
              aided design capability to give undergraduate students the                     
              ability to design and manufacture complex parts. This                          
              capability is directly incorporated into at least two courses                  
              in the form of manufacturing experiments. One laboratory                       
              experiment insures that every undergraduate has at least once,                 
              prior to graduation, designed, manufactured, and tested a                      
              component part. The second manufacturing experiment is used to                 
              test a student's ability to design optimal parts. The                          
              manufacturing capability will further enable prototyping and                   
              construction of complex aerodynamtc models that have been                      
              conceived of, in any of the presently offered design and                       
              student project courses.
