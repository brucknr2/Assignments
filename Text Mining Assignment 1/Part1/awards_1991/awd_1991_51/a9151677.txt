Abstract    :
              This project will create modern, instrumentation-based                         
              laboratories for general chemistry students, science and non-                  
              science majors alike, by using a Microcomputer-Based Laboratory                
              (MBL).  In this system, a personal computer with a laboratory                  
              interface enhances the utility of laboratory instrumentation.                  
              The MBL system can serve as a pH meter, voltmeter, ammeter,                    
              light detector, thermometer, controller, or other instrument,                  
              as well as a data compiler and manipulator.  The computer                      
              allows students to control the experiment, collect data,                       
              analyze it, and make a report of it in a manner not previously                 
              available in the general chemistry laboratory.  All experiments                
              in the course will be conducted in the MBL system.  The grantee                
              will match from non-Federal sources the NSF contribution to                    
              this project.
