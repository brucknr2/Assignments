Abstract    :
              The object of this project is to update and improve the                        
              curriculum for Human Anatomy and Physiology by allowing                        
              students to perform sophisticated, scientifically based                        
              physiology experiments in the laboratory, and demonstrating the                
              value of computers in scientific investigation and analysis.                   
              Computer hardware (IBM-type) and software (Intelitool) systems                 
              are used to demonstrate human reflexes, nerve, muscle, heart,                  
              and lung functions.  Students are able to gather physiological                 
              data using their own bodies, interpret these data, compare                     
              results with classmates, and draw conclusions thus making the                  
              laboratory exercises more meaningful.
