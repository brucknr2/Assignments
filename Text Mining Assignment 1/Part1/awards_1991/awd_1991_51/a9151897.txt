Abstract    :
              Students are using a laboratory equipped with microcomputers                   
              running computer algebra systems to focus on mathematical                      
              concepts rather than manipulation of formulas.  Derive is used                 
              in college algebra, trigonometry, and first year calculus and                  
              Mathematica is used in multivariable calculus and differential                 
              equations.
