Abstract    :
              The purpose of the proposed project is to enhance undergraduate                
              instruction in research methods in psychology.  The project                    
              will facilitate the demonstration of a wide range of                           
              psychological phenomena, as well as the design, execution, and                 
              analysis of original research by undergraduates.  Its impact                   
              will be on five upper-division advanced laboratory courses                     
              (Learning, Cognitive Psychology, Sensation and Perception,                     
              Physiological Psychology, and Animal Behavior), an introductory                
              lab course, and a course in research methods.The core of the                   
              project is a bank of 13 microcomputers to serve as student                     
              stations for data collection and analysis.  One of the                         
              computers is to be used for program development, to assist                     
              students in designing original research.  The software selected                
              will allow students to gain first-hand experience with general                 
              principles of research design, and also with the specific                      
              techniques associated with particular areas within experimental                
              psychology.  This will greatly increase the breadth of research                
              experiences to which students can be exposed, and increase the                 
              variety and sophistication of student-initiated research                       
              projects (required of all majors) by facilitating instruction                  
              in all aspects of the research enterprise.
