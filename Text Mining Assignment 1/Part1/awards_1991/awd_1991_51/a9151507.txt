Abstract    :
              A new Laboratory Process for the general chemistry program                     
              based on modern computer-interfaced FTIR, UV-VIS, and GC                       
              instrumentation will be implemented.  The laboratory will be                   
              closely coordinated with the lecture and will enable science                   
              and engineering students to learn by the methods of                            
              practitioners.  The laboratory will involve problem definition,                
              hypothesis development, experimental design, hypothesis                        
              testing, and assessment and generalization of results.  The                    
              grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
