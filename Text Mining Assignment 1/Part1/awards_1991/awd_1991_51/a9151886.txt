Abstract    :
              A laboratory is being developed in which students can master                   
              multitasking software applications and develop applications                    
              using symbol manipulating systems and expert systems shells.                   
              Students are working with high-level MSDOS-based microcomputers                
              configured with sufficient memory, processing speeds and                       
              graphics capabilities to run advanced MSDOS software.
