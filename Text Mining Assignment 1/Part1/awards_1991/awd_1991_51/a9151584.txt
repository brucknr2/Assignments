Abstract    :
              The University of Wisconsin - La Crosse is equipping their                     
              biochemistry laboratory for undergraduates to isolate, purify                  
              and characterize an enzyme from previously uninvestigated                      
              sources. The students experience the excitement of scientific                  
              discovery within a regularly scheduled course by using                         
              standardized protocols.
