Abstract    :
              This project will enable the School of Planning at the                         
              University of Cincinnati to teach undergraduate planning                       
              students how to use microcomputer-based imaging and animation                  
              as a way of simulating then evaluating alternative urban design                
              proposals.  The School's courses in still-imaging are open to                  
              other undergraduates as well (for example, from architecture).                 
              The School and the University have invested in the                             
              microcomputer hardware necessary for animation. AT&T donated                   
              the animation software.  However, we lack the proper recording                 
              equipment.  Hence, we are requesting NSF support for the                       
              purchase of a video disk recorder to record urban planning and                 
              design animation projects done by students.  Also, we will                     
              purchase a rapid rendering board that reduces the rendering                    
              time per image by an approximate factor of ten, thus enabling                  
              more students to use our single animation station.  This                       
              project is significant in planning because it will enable                      
              students to create dynamic simulations of alternative design                   
              proposals in a microcomputer environment.  We feel that this                   
              could become an important professional skill for our students                  
              given the interest already expressed by prospective employers.
