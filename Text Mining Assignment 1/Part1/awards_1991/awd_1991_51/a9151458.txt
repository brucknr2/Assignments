Abstract    :
              Two Tektronix CAChe workstations (based on a Macintosh IIx and                 
              a 17MIPS coprocessor) and a color printer will be used to                      
              introduce a molecular calculations component into primarily                    
              upper division courses of the chemistry curriculum.  The                       
              calculations involved are extended Hueckel, MNDO, and molecular                
              mechanics types.  The calculation capability will also impact                  
              the organic chemistry course in demonstration mode, and the                    
              research activities of students in several subfields of                        
              chemistry.  These improvements reflect an important trend in                   
              the way chemistry is practiced today.  The grantee will match                  
              the NSF grant from non-Federal sources.
