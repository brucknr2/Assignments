Abstract    :
              This project is the development of an introductory solid state                 
              physics course centered about a semiconductor devices                          
              laboratory.  The objectives of the course are to involve                       
              industry as an informal active partner in the educational                      
              process, and to introduce the student to simultaneous learn-as-                
              you-do directed group experiences.The activities of the course                 
              are designed to allow the student to undergo a project                         
              development-type experience involving team and individual                      
              effort and the parallel opportunity to observe, with some                      
              participation, the same activities in an active industry                       
              environment.  It is also organized to allow the student to                     
              interact with the instructor in an educational environment in                  
              regular laboratory sessions, and in addition to interact                       
              through sessions at the cooperating industry site with                         
              scientists and engineers in the industrial setting.The course                  
              is initially aimed at physics majors and minors, and                           
              engineering technology majors, with plans to modify it slightly                
              for teacher training and field teachers.
