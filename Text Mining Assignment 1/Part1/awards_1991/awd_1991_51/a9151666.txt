Abstract    :
              A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer will be used in upper                
              level undergraduate laboratories in analytical and physical                    
              chemistry and in two new courses, Physical Polymer Chemistry                   
              Laboratory and Advanced Synthesis Laboratory.  Students in                     
              these courses will learn the use of infrared spectroscopy to                   
              characterize and quantitate inorganic, organic, and polymeric                  
              materials.  Many of the experiments will also utilize modern                   
              methods of sample-handling, including diffuse reflectance and                  
              both horizontal and cylindrical attenuated total reflectance.                  
              The new courses will instruct undergraduates in two important                  
              areas of chemistry, and the additional experiments in existing                 
              courses will guarantee that chemistry graduates have adequate                  
              exposure to the theory and modern applications of FTIR.
