Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to provide research-like                      
              experiences for lower-level undergraduates in an introductory cell             
              biology course.  Making use of the eight spectrophotometers                    
              acquired with the grant, students are guided through an open-ended,            
              individualized series of experiments on the biology of the enzyme              
              alkaline phosphatase.  This enzyme has practical significance both             
              in clinical diagnoses and basic research, but its biological                   
              function is not readily apparent.  Thus students quickly recognize             
              that they can make contributions to the knowledge base early in                
              their academic lives, building the confidence and expertise that               
              will encourage them to consider biology as a career.
