Abstract    :
              This proposal is concerned with the development of a Geographic                
              Information Systems (GIS) /Image Processing Laboratory.                        
              Although GIS and Image processing are complimentary analytical                 
              "tools" which are commonly used in geography, geology and other                
              fields, they rarely have been operationally linked and                         
              integrated into a single system.Students in eighteen classes                   
              will have a direct hands-on opportunity to utilize the proposed                
              multi-user, multi-task laboratory for classroom and research                   
              projects.  Hard copy products from the GIS/Image processing                    
              Laboratory will be utilized as demonstrating models in several                 
              other classes.  The proposed hardware and software package                     
              represent state-of-the-art technology in the GIS and Image                     
              processing fields.  Access to such technology and hands-on                     
              experience will enable our students to effectively compete for                 
              the burgeoning employment opportunities in fields utilizing                    
              GIS/Image processing services.
