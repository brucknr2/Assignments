Abstract    :
              This project is transforming the introductory mechanics                        
              laboratory so that freshmen students gain experience with                      
              realistic electronic instrumentation while learning the                        
              fundamentals of mechanics.  The project is part of an extensive                
              curriculum development accompanying a change from a quarter                    
              calendar to a semester one. New experiments are adding dynamic                 
              force transducers, sonar rangers, digital readout strobe                       
              lighting, oscilloscopes, and digital readout function                          
              generators to the air tracks, light gates, air-bearing                         
              rotational apparatus, and PC computers previously used. The new                
              experiments include non-linear systems, small oscillations,                    
              static and dynamic unbalance in rotating objects, and rotation                 
              of rigid bodies about a point. Such new topics as soft modes,                  
              spontaneous symmetry breaking, and chaos are being included.                   
              Folded in are an introduction to electronic instrumentation                    
              including use of oscilloscopes, and study of wave forms,                       
              triggering, signal conditioning, and the integration of                        
              computers into the measurement system. The new lab presents a                  
              richer variety of important mechanical phenomena, is more                      
              interesting, and better prepares the students for employment in                
              a modern industrial or research setting.NSF grant funds are                    
              being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
