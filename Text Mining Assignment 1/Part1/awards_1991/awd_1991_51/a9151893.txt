Abstract    :
              Oregon State University undergraduate students are using high                  
              performance liquid chromatography in advanced analytical and                   
              organic chemistry courses. Students are developing a series of                 
              HPLC separation schemes for the determination of relevant                      
              substances, such as drugs and vitamins, in daily life samples,                 
              such as food products and blood. These experiments illustrate                  
              the use of the technique for the separation of organic                         
              compounds in realistic situations and provides perspective                     
              about variations of the technique. The grantee is matching this                
              award from non-Federal sources.
