Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology and Environmental science is                         
              acquiring subsurface  sampling and seismic equipment for use in                
              laboratory portion of all undergraduate courses. Students in                   
              lower level courses are using the seismic equipment to map                     
              subsurface layers of the earth, while students in upper                        
              division courses to map aquifers in local water district.                      
              Projects are also being undertaken to investigate changes in                   
              lake and bay environment as a function of changes in industrial                
              activities and increasing population.
