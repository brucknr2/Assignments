Abstract    :
              Laboratory instruction for chemistry students will be improved                 
              by implementing a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer and the                  
              corresponding computer work-station and software.  This                        
              instrument will strengthen the chemistry curriculum through a                  
              new laboratory course (Organic Spectroscopy Laboratory) to                     
              complement our current lecture course "Organic Spectroscopy".                  
              It will also improve instruction in the organic chemistry                      
              course, and it will greatly enhance the individual study and                   
              research programs of the Department.  The grantee will match                   
              the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
