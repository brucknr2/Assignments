Abstract    :
              The scanning electron microscope acquired is helping students                  
              taking introductory and advanced courses in biology the ability                
              to directly visualize cell and tissue microanatomy in three                    
              dimensions.  The scanning electron microscopy course developed                 
              complements a course in transmission electron microscopy, and                  
              together they form the basis for developing an A.S. degree                     
              program in Electron Microscopy sciences that will attract a                    
              larger audience from the teaching and research community of the                
              region.
