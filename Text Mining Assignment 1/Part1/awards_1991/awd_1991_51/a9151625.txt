Abstract    :
              An introductory-level electro-mechanical motion devices and                    
              systems laboratory is being developed which has as its                         
              principal focus low-voltage devices, typical to low-power                      
              control system applications.  The primary purpose of the                       
              laboratory is to reinforce experimentally the concepts which                   
              are presented in a Junior-level course in electro-mechanical                   
              motion devices course, which has evolved over the last seven                   
              years as an elective.  Recently this course attained the                       
              position as one of the five basic courses of which all                         
              electrical engineering students must select three; all other                   
              courses of this stature have associated laboratories.  Also,                   
              this laboratory provides a modern setting for the student to                   
              select their required design project in the electro-mechanical                 
              systems area.  The requested equipment includes data                           
              acquisition systems which are interfaced with personal                         
              computers which will assist in the interpretation and analysis                 
              of the steady-state and dynamic characteristics of the electro-                
              mechanical devices considered as well as provide computer                      
              simulation as a tool.
