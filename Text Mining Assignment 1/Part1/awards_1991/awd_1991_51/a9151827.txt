Abstract    :
              Atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics is an important                   
              part of the undergraduate physics laboratory experience. AMO                   
              physics has the advantage over many other fields of current                    
              research of being accessible to undergraduates both                            
              theoretically and experimentally. The objective of the program                 
              here is to establish an undergraduate laboratory in this                       
              field.To develop a strong undergraduate laboratory program in                  
              AMO physics, several pieces of capital equipment and ancillary                 
              hardware are used.  The first major piece of equipment is a                    
              one-meter monochrometer, a device with innumerable uses in                     
              classical spectroscopy. It is used to introduce students to                    
              classical spectroscopic measurements. Second, two laser systems                
              are used, one a pulsed laser system based on Nd:YAG pumped dye                 
              lasers, and the other a continuous wave semiconductor diode                    
              laser for use in modern atomic and molecular spectroscopy.                     
              Students can investigate both pulsed and cw spectroscopy to                    
              determine the fundamental relationship between the time and                    
              frequency domains.The spectroscopy equipment provides students                 
              with an opportunity to learn general principles of                             
              experimentation as well as introduce them to specific atomic                   
              phenomena.
