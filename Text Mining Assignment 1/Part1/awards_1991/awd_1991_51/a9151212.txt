Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing an FT-IR for use in                  
              sophomore and upper division laboratory courses. Students in                   
              these courses are investigating the rotational-vibrational                     
              spectra of various hydrogen and alkyl halides, conducting                      
              basicity studies and quantitatively analyzing reaction                         
              mixtures. Undergraduates are working closely with the faculty                  
              to develop new experiments for use at other institutions.
