Abstract    :
              A cluster of instruments interfaced with microcomputers will be                
              established for first-year students of instrumental methods of                 
              analysis.  Traditional analytical techniques and modern                        
              instrumentation will enable students to carry out laboratory                   
              projects using real and synthetic samples, and to gain                         
              experience in chemical science as it is practiced.  The                        
              centerpiece of the instrument cluster is a diode array uv-                     
              visible spectrophotomer, interfaced with a microcomputer for                   
              data acquisition and manipulation.  Instrumentation for                        
              potentiometric analyses, also computerized, and atomic                         
              absorption spectroscopy completes the initial stage of                         
              development of this introductory laboratory for chemistry                      
              majors and minors.  The grantee will match the NSF award from                  
              non-Federal sources.
