Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to improve the computational and                    
              data manipulation skills of students in biology and                            
              mathematics.  The purchase of computer hardware and software                   
              enhances the laboratory skills of biology majors and non-majors                
              by allowing the simulation of actual experiments such as                       
              genetics crosses.  The results are analyzed using interactive                  
              computer software.  By planning biology and mathematics                        
              instruction cooperatively, problem solving, graphics and                       
              statistical inference skills are also enhanced when mathematics                
              students analyze biology problems
