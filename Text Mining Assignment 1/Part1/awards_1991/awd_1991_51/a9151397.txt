Abstract    :
              An upper-division mathematics computer classroom/laboratory                    
              (CCL) has been established in the Department of Mathematics.                   
              The CCL has nine standalone DECstation 3100s capable of                        
              running, without accessing a server, powerful mathematical                     
              software.  These workstations and the software serve as                        
              catalysts for transforming a traditional mathematics classroom                 
              into a mathematics cauldron of interaction, experimentation and                
              discovery.  The CCL is used in a broad range of theoretical and                
              applied courses and to promote student research projects.
