Abstract    :
              This project will introduce the capabilities of 200 MHz Fourier                
              transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy into                
              our courses in organic chemistry and advanced experimental                     
              techniques.  In organic chemistry the instrument will be used                  
              for structural analyses via proton and carbon-13 spectroscopy.                 
              The greater sensitivity of FT-NMR to characterize products will                
              find use in the microscale organic laboratory.  Experiments                    
              will be introduced to increase student awareness of NMR                        
              applications.  The high magnetic field and chemical shift                      
              reagents will be utilized to resolve spectra of complex                        
              molecules and optical stereoisomer mixtures.  In the advanced                  
              course a variety of experiments will be offered which                          
              illustrate and explain currently used NMR techniques such as                   
              nuclear spin decoupling and measurement of nuclear relaxation                  
              times within a molecular structure.  Reactions of organic                      
              ligands in transition metal coordination compounds will be                     
              monitored via carbon-13 observation.
