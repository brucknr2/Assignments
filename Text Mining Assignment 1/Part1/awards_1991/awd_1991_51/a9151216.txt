Abstract    :
              The feedback control laboratory provides students with hands on                
              experience in control system identification, compensator                       
              design, and performance verification.  The experiments are                     
              structured such that the students learn and test problem-                      
              solving strategies in feedback control.  Personal computers                    
              perform process data acquisition and real-time process control.                
              The computers provide graphics support for system                              
              identification and compensator design choices, for comparisons                 
              between predicted and actual performance, and for iterative                    
              performance improvement.  Students design test compensators for                
              thermal, fluid, pneumatic, and high-pressure hydraulic control                 
              systems, as well as DC-motor speed and position control                        
              systems.
