Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a diode array uv/vis                 
              spectrophotometer for use in several upper division laboratory                 
              courses.  With the aid of this equipment new experiments                       
              reflecting the importance of inorganic materials and                           
              bioinorganic chemistry are being introduced to the                             
              undergraduate curriculum.  The study of the size-dependent                     
              bandgap and particle size of semiconductor clusters and the                    
              oxidation of iron porphyrin complexes are two examples of the                  
              innovative
