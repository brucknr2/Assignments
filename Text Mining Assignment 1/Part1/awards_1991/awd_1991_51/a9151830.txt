Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to expand an undergraduate                   
              teaching laboratory in neurobiology to include the exploration                 
              of fundamental molecular mechanisms of neural signalling.  The                 
              course most directly affected concerns cellular and molecular                  
              neuroscience, which is one of two advanced core courses in a                   
              neuroscience major now under development.  The requested                       
              equipment includes apparatus for assaying protein                              
              concentration, cell fractionation, studying receptor binding,                  
              studying intracellular second messenger systems, exploring the                 
              pharmacological basis of synaptic transmission, and visualizing                
              the expression of particular neuronal genes with in situ                       
              hybridization techniques.  The addition of these molecular                     
              techniques to the array of cellular and other methods now                      
              supported in the teaching laboratory permit the students to                    
              experience a rich variety of the techniques fundamental to                     
              modern neuroscience.
