Abstract    :
                A Program to Improve Laboratory and Classroom Instruction of                 
              an Undergraduate Social Science Curriculum     The proposal is                 
              for equipment which will allow five social science departments                 
              to build upon a successful National Science Foundation LOCI                    
              grant received by the Departmment of Sociology in 1982.  The                   
              curriculum implemented in the Department of Sociology with the                 
              LOCI funds integrated research methos into the the content of                  
              courses spanning the entire curriculum.  A recent purchase of                  
              a laptop computer/video projection system permittd this                        
              successful pedogogy to be expanded to non-majors in large                      
              introductory courses.  Funds from this ILI grant would expand                  
              this pedagogy to the departments of anthroplogy, geography,                    
              political science and psychology.  The ILI funds will create a                 
              30 workstation social science computer laboratory and procure                  
              additional video projection equipment.  The project has strong                 
              institutional support and College funds are committed to the                   
              planned upgrading and replacment of the requested equipment.
