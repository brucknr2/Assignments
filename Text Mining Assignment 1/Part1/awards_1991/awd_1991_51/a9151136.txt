Abstract    :
              The project introduces the use of the state-of-the-art                         
              analytical photogrammetric plotter to students in the Surveying                
              Engineering curriculum.  Aerial photographs and photogrammetric                
              plotting instruments have been used for making topographic maps                
              ever since the advent of the airplane. Until a decade ago,                     
              these instruments were manually operated and the output was a                  
              graphical map constructed on a plotting table which was                        
              connected to the stereoplotter. Recently, these plotters have                  
              been interfaced with computers and many of the orientation and                 
              mapping operations have been semi-automated. It is very                        
              important that graduates are able to attain some functional                    
              competency on this equipment in order to meet the critical                     
              needs of the mapping profession.
