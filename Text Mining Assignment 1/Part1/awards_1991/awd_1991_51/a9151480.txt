Abstract    :
              In the process of revising and strengthening its undergraduate                 
              curriculum, the Biology Department will encourage, enhance and                 
              stimulate undergraduate research through a 3 phase program: a)                 
              a course in scientific methods and proposal development; b)                    
              execution of directed undergraduate research; and c)                           
              presentation in a symposium format.  This proposal is a request                
              for a computer and light microscopy/microanalysis facility to                  
              support these undergraduate research activities.  The program                  
              and this request is an essential component of the Department's                 
              desire to seek a high level of excellence in undergraduate                     
              biology.
