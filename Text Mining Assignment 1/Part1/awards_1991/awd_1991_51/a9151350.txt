Abstract    :
              The undergraduate curriculum in chemistry will be improved by                  
              a new rapid scan 60 MHz CW-NMR instrument.  This NMR is                        
              particularly suitable for undergraduate teaching laboratories                  
              because it is easy to operate and maintain, and acquires                       
              spectra rapidly.  This instrument's increased sensitivity will                 
              greatly expand the quantity and quality of experiments carried                 
              out in the micro-scale organic laboratories.  Students in the                  
              Advanced Organic course will use the instrument in combination                 
              with a computer molecular modeling program for conformational                  
              analysis experiments.  The instrument will also have                           
              substantial impact on the Advanced Instrumental Analysis and                   
              the Physical Chemistry courses.  The grantee will match the NSF                
              award from non-Federal sources.
