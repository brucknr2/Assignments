Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is purchasing a Fourier Transform                     
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer (FT NMR) with variable                 
              temperature capability. Students in organic chemistry are                      
              obtaining 1H and 13C spectra to identify unknowns, reaction                    
              products, and the compositions of mixtures. Atomic                             
              connectivity, molecular geometry and stereochemistry are                       
              obtained  from 2-D experiments, as well as estimates of average                
              bond lengths from Nuclear Overhauser Effects. In Biochemistry,                 
              Physical and Inorganic Chemistry, the variable temperature                     
              ability allows the measurement of DNA conformations, reaction                  
              rates, and activation
