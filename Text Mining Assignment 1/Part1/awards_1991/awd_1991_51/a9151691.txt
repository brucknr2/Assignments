Abstract    :
               An instructional computing laboratory for pre-calculus                        
              students is being developed. The project began in spring 1990,                 
              with a small-scale trial and will continue  with the                           
              collaboration of the Technical-Vocational Institute, a two-year                
              institution  from which many students transfer to the                          
              University of New Mexico. The goals are to implement use of a                  
              computer assisted instructional program with an emphasis on                    
              cooperative learning as an integral part of the pre-calculus                   
              level courses and accumulate a data base of information on                     
              students' math backgrounds, performance, and attitudes, which                  
              will be used in determining bow to more effectively meet the                   
              needs of minority and other groups that frequently have                        
              difficulty in mathematics.
