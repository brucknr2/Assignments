Abstract    :
              Calvin College's Physics Department is utilizing two                           
              instruments to add modern Fourier-analysis capability to the                   
              Fourier-synthesis methods already used in a variety of courses.                
              The equipment corrects a curricular deficiency identified in                   
              the treatment of waves in general physics, health physics,                     
              mechanics, electronics, and laboratory courses.  The Fourier                   
              analyzers enable students to see how audio, or general                         
              electronic, signals can be decomposed into a sum of sinusoidal                 
              waves, and how this "frequency domain" viewpoint allows various                
              physical phenomena to be understood.  A computer-resident fast-                
              Fourier-transform instrument added to a laboratory                             
              microcomputer serves to capture and Fourier-transform signals                  
              in the 0 - 500 kHz range.  This instrument is particularly                     
              useful in acoustics demonstrations and electronic measurement.                 
              A stand-alone radio-frequency spectrum analyzer extends                        
              Fourier-analysis capability to 2000 Mhz, and makes possible a                  
              variety of measurements, experiments, and research directions                  
              in electronics and modern optics.NSF grant funds are being
