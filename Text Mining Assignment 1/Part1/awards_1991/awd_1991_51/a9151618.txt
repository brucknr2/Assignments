Abstract    :
              The project goal is to provide a strong emphasis on the design                 
              process itself, on the interconnection between manufacturing                   
              and design, and on design for specified reliability, quality,                  
              maintainability, and/or cost.  The laboratory emphasizes the                   
              interrelation between design and manufacturing, with extensive                 
              usage of CAD/CAM.  Experiments to test strength under static                   
              and dynamic loading (fatigue), reliability, and surface                        
              topography of product are included.  Experiments to control the                
              stability of manufacturing processes are also provided.
