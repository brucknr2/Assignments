Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing equipment for a                      
              laboratory course in polymer chemistry. The equipment is                       
              allowing students to more fully characterize polymers by the                   
              determination of molecular weights, thermal properties, and                    
              mechanical properties. An unusual feature of the course is the                 
              emphasis on the influence of various additives on the thermal                  
              and mechanical properties of polymers.
