Abstract    :
              An undergraduate Photonics Laboratory is being developed to                    
              support laboratories in five senior level electives in the                     
              Department of Electrical Engineering: Fiber Optics, Design in                  
              Electromagnetics and Optics, Fourier Optics, Laser Electronics                 
              and Optical Sensors.  This new undergraduate laboratory in                     
              optics and photonics also will be used to develop experiments                  
              to be used in required courses in electromagnetics and devices                 
              and circuits.
