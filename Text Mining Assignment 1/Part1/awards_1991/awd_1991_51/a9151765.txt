Abstract    :
              Modern methods of instrumental analysis will be reemphasized in                
              our curriculum by incorporating a 60 MHz NMR instrument.  The                  
              instrument would be used mainly in the organic chemistry course                
              in hands-on mode to do new experiments involving chemical shift                
              reagents, spin-spin decoupling, and identification of                          
              laboratory products from micro-scale experiments.                              
              Investigative activities of students will be made possible by                  
              the instrument.
