Abstract    :
              This project includes the introduction of several experiments                  
              into the Department of Chemistry's Instrumentation curriculum.                 
              Two experiments are proposed for advancement of the                            
              Instrumental Analysis course:  The Identification and                          
              Quantification of Pollutants in Ambient Air, and The                           
              Quantification of Toluene in Soil.  One experiment is proposed                 
              for introduction into the Advanced Inorganic laboratory                        
              curriculum:  Calculation of Carbonyl Force Constants in                        
              Manganese Pentacarbonyl Bromide.  Three other experiments are                  
              proposed for enhancement of the Undergraduate Research Course.                 
              All of these experiments and research projects feature FTIR                    
              analyses and technology.The Department of Chemistry's                          
              undergraduate research program is involved in the enhancement                  
              project.  Projects featuring FTIR technology include the                       
              following:  Coordination of Nitric Oxide to Cobaltous                          
              Phthalocyanines, Characterization of Non-benozoid Aromatics,                   
              and Polyurethane Foam as Absorbents for Organic Contaminates.                  
              Two of these experiments feature surface reflectance analysis                  
              utilizing FTIR technology.Incorporation of these experiments                   
              and research projects into the current curriculum will serve to                
              strengthen the Department of Chemistry's undergraduate program                 
              by expanding and modernizing laboratory experiments and                        
              projects which will better prepare its students for successful                 
              careers in both industry and educational research.
