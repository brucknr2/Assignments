Abstract    :
              To attract more students into the sciences the Biology and                     
              Chemistry Departments united their efforts to institute a                      
              modern advanced biochemistry laboratory course that provides a                 
              dynamic view of these sciences and opportunities for                           
              undergraduate research.  The acquisition of centrifuges,                       
              electrophoresis equipment, and a polymerase chain reaction                     
              temperature cycler allows laboratory exercises to focus on                     
              contemporary projects and techniques that have sophisticated                   
              applications, yet are easily within the capabilities of an                     
              advanced undergraduate.  The equipment is also used for other                  
              laboratories and for independent student research.
