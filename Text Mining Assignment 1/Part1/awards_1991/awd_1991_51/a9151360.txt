Abstract    :
              The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the                   
              University of Alabama in Huntsville has initiated the                          
              development of a comprehensive laboratory which provides                       
              "hands-on" education in digital signal processing, control,                    
              robotics, and communications.  Two adjacent and identical rooms                
              with an area of 1500 square ft.  are provided for this lab.                    
              There are 12 workstations in each room.  The main components of                
              these workstations are: TMS320C30 DSP Evaluation Board, an IBM                 
              386/25 MHz computer, DSP hardware and software development                     
              systems.  The TMS320C30 DSP is a high performance 32 bit                       
              floating-point device in the TMS32O family of single-chip DSPs.                
              The 60-ns cycle time of the TM5320C30 allows it to execute                     
              operations at a performance rate up to 33 MFLOPS with parallel                 
              multiply and ALU operations on both integer and floating-point                 
              data in a single cycle.  The TMS320C30 real-time performance                   
              offer flexible design approach in a variety of applications.                   
              At the junior level, students are introduced to the                            
              implementation of basic DSP algorithms such as sampling                        
              techniques, convolution, correlation, and fast Fourier                         
              transforms using the TMS320C30 Evaluation Board.  At the senior                
              level, students apply these tools to implement design projects                 
              in the areas of control, robotics, or communications.
