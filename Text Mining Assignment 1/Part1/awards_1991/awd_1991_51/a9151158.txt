Abstract    :
              The aim of the proposed project is to improve the quality of                   
              instruction in an undergraduate human neurophysiology course by                
              supplementing classroom teaching and discussion with laboratory                
              experiences which are currently not available because of a lack                
              of instrumentation. The proposed purchase of a motion analysis                 
              system and 5 computer workstations which use state-of-the-art                  
              technology in the computer controlled analysis of videotaped                   
              movement and muscle electrical activity will allow students the                
              opportunity for direct involvement in the collection and                       
              analysis of data as well as the formulation of conclusions                     
              pertaining to the neurophysiological basis of human movement.                  
              The development of the laboratory experiences through the use                  
              of the proposed equipment will significantly enhance the                       
              students' abilities to comprehend complex neurophysiological                   
              concepts relative to normal and pathological sensory motor                     
              transformations by allowing them to actively participate in the                
              replication of classical and original experiments.
