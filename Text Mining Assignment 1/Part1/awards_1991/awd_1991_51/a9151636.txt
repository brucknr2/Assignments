Abstract    :
              A Fourier Transform infrared spectrophotometer, with associated                
              sampling accessories and a spectal library will be used by                     
              students in organic, instrumental analysis, physical,                          
              inorganic, and polymer coatings courses, as well as in                         
              undergraduate research projects.  Theoretical aspects of                       
              Fourier Transformation and computer-controlled data acquisition                
              and manipulation, now mainly lecture topics, will be                           
              experimentally studied and utilized by these chemistry                         
              students.  The instrument will also be introduced in lower                     
              level chemistry courses, including a nonmajors course, where it                
              will show the power of modern, computer-based instrumentation                  
              in studies of samples obtained from the everyday world.  The                   
              grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
