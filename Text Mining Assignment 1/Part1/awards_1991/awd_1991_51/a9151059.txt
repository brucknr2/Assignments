Abstract    :
              Students are participating in a newly developed Nonlinear                      
              Lattice Dynamic course, one of a set of experimental                           
              mathematics courses being developed at Northwestern and one                    
              which cannot be taught without significant computer facilities.                
              Displaying features of systems of equations on the screen in                   
              the classroom laboratory makes it possible to discuss and                      
              analyze how the whole family of solutions depend on their                      
              initial conditions and to compare and contrast how the                         
              nonlinear solutions are approximated by their linear                           
              counterparts.
