Abstract    :
              This project is establishing a Scanning Tunneling Microscope                   
              (STM) in an undergraduate Modern Physics Laboratory. It is                     
              enabling undergraduates, for the first time, to actually see                   
              atomic surfaces and "see atoms". The aim is to actively expose                 
              advanced physics majors to contemporary, state- of-the-art                     
              surface physics. The mechanical part of the microscope is being                
              built in the departmental machine shop, using a proven design,                 
              and interfaced to a PC computer. The design of this STM permits                
              its use by senior undergraduate students and yet allows                        
              modifications and improvements by such students. The students                  
              are able to use the latest methods of preparing scanning tips                  
              and study naturally clean, quality surfaces of carbon, gold,                   
              TaS2 and TaSe2. These surfaces show both atomic and electronic                 
              structure without the difficulties of high vacuum techniques.                  
              The students are exposed to modern methods of image processing                 
              using a high speed, high video resolution, personal computer as                
              a necessary part of the STM. This Nobel prize winning method of                
              probing the atomic structure of surfaces permits physics                       
              students to do what has not been possible before; to actually                  
              "see" an atom.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from                
              non-federal sources.
