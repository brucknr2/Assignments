Abstract    :
              This project upgrades the quality and changes the approach of                  
              College Physics Labs by increasing student inquiry skills                      
              through experiences which stress problem solving and                           
              experimental skills.  This is done by introducing computers for                
              data acquisition and analysis along with appropriate                           
              experiments in mechanics and nuclear science. These                            
              improvements in reviving the interactive nature of the                         
              laboratory experience are also structured to benefit secondary                 
              education science teacher students by stressing skills and the                 
              use of modern lab equipment that the State requires them to                    
              learn. A subsidiary benefit of this program is the use of this                 
              equipment in upper division labs when it is not being used in                  
              introductory labs.
