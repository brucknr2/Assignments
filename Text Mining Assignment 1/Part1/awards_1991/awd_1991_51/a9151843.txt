Abstract    :
              This project addresses the upgrade of the the Universal Testing                
              Machine (UTM), a key piece of equipment in the materials                       
              engineering laboratory, by interfacing with computers and                      
              automating the data acquisition process.  As a result,                         
              undergraduate students obtain a better understanding of                        
              material behavior and testing techniques.
