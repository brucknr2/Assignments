Abstract    :
              This project develops a junior/senior level Controls Laboratory                
              at Christian Brothers University, with Allen-Bradley                           
              Programmable Logic Controllers and IBM compatible 80386                        
              machines.An Allen-Bradley Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC),                
              along with a multitude of input and output modules are provided                
              at each station.  The PLC experiments use electromechanical                    
              equipment and allow the students to network their own plant                    
              process.  In addition to the broad applications of PLCs,                       
              students explore how the PLC itself operates by running small                  
              controls experiments, using the data acquisition capability of                 
              Tektronix programmable GBIP instrumentation, such as                           
              oscilloscopes, digital multimeters and universal sources.  The                 
              equipment flexibility and adaptability are applied to a broad                  
              range of experiments.
