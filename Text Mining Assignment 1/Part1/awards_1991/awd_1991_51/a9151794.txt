Abstract    :
              An existing microprocessor-based system design course is being                 
              developed into an application-specific architecture course.                    
              This course will have a new laboratory which is being developed                
              so that students can implement their hardware prototypes using                 
              field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA).  FPGAs allow students to                
              quickly build, test, and modify their designs; thus                            
              architectural changes can be implemented within minutes                        
              reinforcing lessons in architectural optimization.  A sequence                 
              of experiments is being developed build around audio processing                
              systems designed to provide hardware/software tradeoffs for                    
              high-performance architectures tuned to specific algorithms.
