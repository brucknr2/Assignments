Abstract    :
              A major goal of the Alma College Biochemistry Department is to                 
              provide well equipped facilities to teach undergraduate                        
              students modem techniques in biochemistry and molecular                        
              genetics.  The goal of this project is to introduce                            
              fluorescence spectroscopy into the undergraduate biochemistry                  
              laboratory as a powerful analytical tool. The requested                        
              instrumentation provides rapid and sensitive detection of                      
              molecular events allowing investigation into areas of                          
              biochemistry that complement current methodology and                           
              instrumentation available in the laboratory as well as                         
              reinforce the lecture portions of the courses offered in the                   
              department.   The introductory biochemistry, advanced                          
              biochemistry, and molecular genetics courses offered by the                    
              biochemistry department will use the fluorescence                              
              spectrophotometer and supporting equipment.  We will study                     
              protein-ligand interactions, enzyme kinetics, and protein                      
              denaturation kinetics; to investigate properties of liposomes,                 
              living cells, and biological membranes; to quantitate small                    
              amounts of nucleic acids; and to probe protein-nucleic acid                    
              interactions. In addition to its role in the classroom                         
              experience, the fluorescence spectrophotometer will also                       
              enhance student research opportunities that Alma College                       
              provides its students. The instrumentation will significantly                  
              enhance the biochemistry laboratory experience and will provide                
              students with a powerful technique that is underutilized in the                
              undergraduate biochemistry laboratory presently.
