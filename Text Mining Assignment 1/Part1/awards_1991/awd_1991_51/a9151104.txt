Abstract    :
              This project constructs a series of "showcase" experiments for                 
              the undergraduate chemical engineering laboratories at Ohio                    
              University.  The emphasis of these experiments is their visual                 
              nature, allowing for a vivid demonstration of underlying                       
              engineering principles.  Traditional experiments in                            
              undergraduate laboratories can be greatly enhanced through the                 
              use of clear tubing, color change reactions and real-time data                 
              display. Experiments are planned in multiphase mixing, reaction                
              kinetics, fluid flow, heat transfer, process control and                       
              materials analysis.  The experiments serve many purposes: they                 
              are used as experiments in the undergraduate laboratory                        
              courses, as demonstration projects in the appropriate                          
              undergraduate lecture courses, and as demonstration experiments                
              for a "Taster" course in chemical engineering being implemented                
              by the department. This course is an intensive two-day                         
              experience for high school students designed as an introduction                
              to chemical engineering.  The ability to let the participants                  
              conduct visually dynamic experiments is critically important to                
              excite these students to pursue a career in chemical                           
              engineering.
