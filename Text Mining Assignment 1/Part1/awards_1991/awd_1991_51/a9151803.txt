Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is purchasing an eletrochemical                       
              analyzer for use in freshman chemistry, instrumental analysis,                 
              and physical chemistry courses. Students in freshamn chemistry                 
              are using the instrument to measure changes in the reduction                   
              potential of metal ions upon complexation. Students in upper                   
              level courses are investigating aspects of cyclic voltammetry,                 
              anodic and cathodic stripping voltammetry, chronocoulometry,                   
              square-wave voltammetry, and differential pulse voltammetry.The                
              instrument is also being used for undergradauate independent                   
              research projects in the mechanisms of redox reactions of                      
              organic compounds, determinations of stability constants, and                  
              determination of trace metals in the environment.The new                       
              instrumentation will be made available to senior chemistry and                 
              biochemistry majors for use in their independent study research                
              projects.  The requested equipment will also be integrated into                
              the college's annual summer program in chemistry which is                      
              attended by 35-40 advanced high school students.
