Abstract    :
              This project provides an opportunity to create a laboratory in                 
              which sophomore CAD students develop drawings of models that                   
              will be analyzed by senior finite-element students. This                       
              interaction should prove beneficial for both groups. The                       
              seniors gain experience working on a team and with individuals                 
              with less technical knowledge. The sophomores get a better                     
              appreciation of their chosen field, insight into their future                  
              classes, an opportunity to become involved with upper classmen,                
              etc. The equipment includes computers, printers, software, and                 
              a plotter.
