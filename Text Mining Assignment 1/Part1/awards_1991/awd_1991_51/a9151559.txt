Abstract    :
              Students are focusing more on concepts in a computer laboratory                
              that supports numerical, symbolic and graphical calculations.                  
              The laboratory consists of 15 NeXT personal workstations,                      
              supported by networked fileservers and laser printers.  A                      
              laboratory experience is being incorporated into six                           
              mathematics and mathematics education courses.
