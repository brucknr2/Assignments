Abstract    :
              This project is associated with the establishment of a new                     
              mechanical engineering laboratory course.  The first half of                   
              the course is an electronics laboratory; the second half of the                
              course involves engineering measurements and data acquisition.                 
              The equipment for the electronics laboratory are computers with                
              appropriate boards allowing the computers to perform as                        
              oscilloscopes and spectrum analyzers. Solderless bread boards                  
              are used by the students for the experiments involving                         
              electronics. For the measurements portion of the laboratory,                   
              traversing mechanisms, data acquisition boards, proximity                      
              probes, etc. are required.
