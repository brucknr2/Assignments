Abstract    :
              A cooperative effort involving Appalachian State University,                   
              Rollins College, and Winston State University is under way that                
              is introducing students and faculty to the use of computer                     
              algebra systems.  These systems are being used in the revision                 
              of pre-calculus courses at all three institutions.  A new                      
              laboratory at Winston Salem State equipped with Macintosh                      
              computers is used to implement these changes at that                           
              institution.
