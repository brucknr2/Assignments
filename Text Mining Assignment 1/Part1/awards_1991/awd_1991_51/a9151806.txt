Abstract    :
              The Department of Meteorology is equipping a laboratory                        
              dedicated to educating undergraduates in meteorological                        
              measurements, instruments, and data analysis. The laboratory is                
              providing instruction with state-of-the-art equipment in the                   
              fields of mesoscale and operational meteorology, air quality                   
              and atmospheric chemistry, and global climate change. This                     
              innovative program is expected to stimulate a national                         
              revitalization of the meteorology curriculum.
