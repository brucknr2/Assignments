Abstract    :
               North Carolina State University is developing a digital signal                
              processing laboratory facility to form the nucleus of a state-                 
              of-the-art, real-time, real-data laboratory which allows                       
              students actual system design and implementation experience and                
              complements the existing strengths in theory and simulation.                   
              It is comprised of 15 NeXTstations and one NeXTdimension color                 
              station in a local area network with one NeXTcube server as the                
              central controller.  The students use the laboratory to perform                
              supervised experiments which demonstrate fundamental concepts                  
              (e.g. analog-to-digital conversion, spectrum analysis,                         
              aliasing, convolution, sampling) and for their design projects.                
              Typical design projects include: building a modem for a digital                
              PSK system; building a spectrum analyzer; or designing a                       
              compression and storage system for images and/or speech.
