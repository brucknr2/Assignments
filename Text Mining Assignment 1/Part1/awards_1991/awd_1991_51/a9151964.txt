Abstract    :
              The scientific equipment associated with this project  greatly                 
              enhances the Applied Power Systems course by adding an                         
              increased level of depth to the study of expansible chamber                    
              internal combustion engine systems. The engine cycle analyzer,                 
              consisting of a crankshaft position encoder, a cylinder                        
              pressure transducer and a microprocessor system, allows                        
              students to collect cylinder pressure and volume data during                   
              testing. The unique contribution this device makes is not only                 
              tabulated but also graphically plotted pressure and volume                     
              curves for the entire operating cycle of an initial combustion                 
              engine.
