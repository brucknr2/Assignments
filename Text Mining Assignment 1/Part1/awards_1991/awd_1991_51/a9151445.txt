Abstract    :
              An integrated wind tunnel and data acquisition laboratory which                
              allows undergraduate mechanical and aerospace engineering                      
              students to study aspects of classical and modern aerodynamics                 
              is established. The laboratory includes a low turbulence wind                  
              tunnel which is designed for experiments involving both laminar                
              flows and flows which are in the process of transition to                      
              turbulence. Facilities which can produce the high flow quality                 
              necessary for modem aerodynamics experiments are usually                       
              reserved for graduate research. The wind tunnel features                       
              interchangeable test cells measuring 750 mm X 750 mm in cross-                 
              section that allow experiments to be set up without disrupting                 
              concurrent wind tunnel testing. In addition, modern                            
              instrumentation interfaced to a computer based data acquisition                
              system allows students to acquire, process, and interpret                      
              experimental data for a variety of fundamental experiments.                    
              This will serve to reinforce basic concepts studied in pure                    
              engineering science courses in addition to teaching students                   
              modern experimental methods.
