Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to expand and enhance a laboratory                
              course in cell and molecular biology by providing opportunities                
              for students to participate in semester-length research                        
              projects to study the storage, processing, and transfer of                     
              genetic information in biological systems.  An ultracentrifuge,                
              phase-contrast microscope, UV spectrophotometer, and                           
              electrophoretic apparatus are requested to conduct experiments                 
              involving plasmid DNA isolation, DNA cloning, and
