Abstract    :
              These funds will provide for the acquisition of equipment                      
              necessary to teach a junior/senior level plant physiology                      
              course.  An upper level cell biology laboratory course will                    
              also benefit from this grant.  In this course students will                    
              conduct plant physiology experiments with plants culturally                    
              significant to them or plants of African origin, but not to the                
              exclusion of other plant species.  Students are required to                    
              design and run an experiment as a special class project and                    
              report the results in the form of a scientific presentation.                   
              The course will emphasize plant biochemistry, water relations                  
              and mineral nutrition, growth and development, and                             
              photosynthesis.  Environmental aspects of plant physiology will                
              be demonstrated as well.  Therefore, we are requesting a                       
              centrifuge, spectrophotometer, shaker, balances, pH meter,                     
              laminar air flow hood, a growth chamber, and a thermocouple                    
              psychrometer.  The presence of this equipment in our                           
              undergraduate program will facilitate the teaching of plant                    
              physiology, enhance our capabilities for undergraduate                         
              research, and influence the career choices of our students.
