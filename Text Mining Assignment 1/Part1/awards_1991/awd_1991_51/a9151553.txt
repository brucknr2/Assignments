Abstract    :
              This project enhances the student's ability to measure fluid                   
              motion by the installation of a laser doppler anemometer flow                  
              system and by the construction of a new wave tank.  In the                     
              fluid dynamics laboratory, an introduction to the application                  
              of lasers in the field of measurements is presented.  The                      
              equipment enables the students to measure the velocity profiles                
              for different flows.  The laser doppler velocimeter allows a                   
              focused measurement of velocity and turbulence in fluid flows,                 
              without disturbing the movement of the fluid particles.                        
              Experiments illustrate such concepts as flow separation, stall,                
              vortex shedding, drag calculation, turbulence, and shear                       
              stress.  When students finish their fluid dynamics laboratory,                 
              they are ready to expand their capability to conduct more                      
              experiments on flow phenomena in the coastal environment using                 
              the new wave flume.
