Abstract    :
              An existing Cary 14 Spectrophotometer is being upgraded to a                   
              modern instrument for student instruction and research by a                    
              complete rehabilitation of the photodetectors and electronic                   
              circuits, and the addition of a computer controlled data                       
              acquisition system.  The upgraded instrument is serving as the                 
              focus for student research projects, now required in the SUNY                  
              Plattsburgh Physics curriculum.  Faculty are supervising                       
              student research utilizing the upgraded instrument in two                      
              research areas, semiconductors and meteorite reflection                        
              spectroscopy.  In addition, the upgraded Cary 14 is being used                 
              for student laboratory experiments in the Intermediate                         
              Laboratory and Physical Optics courses.NSF grant funds are                     
              being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
