Abstract    :
              To improve undergraduate science teaching, Central Washington                  
              University is developing a computer-based Interactive                          
              Multimedia Laboratory.  Although CWU is a comprehensive                        
              university it is also the main teacher-training institution in                 
              Washington state.  Fully one-third of its graduates are                        
              prospective elementary/secondary school teachers, many of them                 
              women, who will serve urban and rural (often disadvantaged                     
              agricultural or timber-harvesting) communities.  Since over 80%                
              of these students take introductory anthropology courses the                   
              Interactive Multimedia Laboratory will be used primarily by the                
              Department of Anthropology.  The immediate target student                      
              population will consist of freshmen and sophomores enrolled in                 
              introductory archaeology.  Supported by the National Science                   
              Foundation, CWU will acquire ten Macintosh LC microcomputers,                  
              plus peripheral hardware including interactive videotape, video                
              disc, and CD-ROM players.  Software will include Anthropology                  
              3 (a HyperCard-based, EDUCOM award-winning system developed by                 
              archaeologist Brian M. Fagan, University of California at Santa                
              Barbara).  Adapting and enhancing this software, CWU faculty                   
              will transform their introductory courses from a traditional                   
              lecture-based format, to a learner-centered format emphasizing                 
              small-group discussion, problem-solving activity, critical                     
              thinking, and the exploration of multi-media databases and                     
              simulations.  Anticipated future use of the lab includes an                    
              intensive summer program of interactive multi-media experience                 
              for in-service elementary/secondary science teachers.
