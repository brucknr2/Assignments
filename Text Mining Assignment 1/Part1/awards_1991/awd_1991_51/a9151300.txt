Abstract    :
              Future teachers are being prepared for the 21st century in a                   
              computer laboratory for special sections of calculus.  The                     
              prospective teachers are Teaching Fellows supported by the                     
              state of North Carolina in return for their agreement to teach                 
              in the state for at least four years.  Students are making                     
              extensive use of IBM PS/2 model 55SX computers running Derive,                 
              CAL and PHASER to experiment an to better understand concepts.                 
              One of the goals is to entice more of these students to enroll                 
              in higher level mathematics courses.
