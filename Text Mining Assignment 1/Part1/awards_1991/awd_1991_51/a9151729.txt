Abstract    :
              Several new integrated high-field FT-NMR experiments for                       
              organic and polymer chemistry laboratories will be developed as                
              the organic laboratories are converted to microscale.  First-                  
              semester organic students will be introduced to 1H FT-NMR by                   
              deducing the structure of a simple acetate.  An ester derived                  
              from an unknown acid and alcohol will be elucidated with proton                
              and 13C I-D and 2-D NMR techniques in the second semester.                     
              Asymmetric synthesis and stereochemical analysis by NMR will                   
              also be included in the second semester.  The advanced organic                 
              laboratory will analyze a monosaccharide by acetylation and                    
              sophisticated NMR analysis of the derivative.  Polymer labs                    
              being developed will feature high-resolution NMR determination                 
              of kinetic parameters in a copolymerization system and                         
              determination of polymer stereochemistry in a group-transfer                   
              polymerization.  The grantee will match the NSF grant from non-                
              Federal sources.
