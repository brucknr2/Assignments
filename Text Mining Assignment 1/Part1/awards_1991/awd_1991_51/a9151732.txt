Abstract    :
              This project establishes an undergraduate computer integrated                  
              design laboratory. Closely coupled to the laboratory is the                    
              development of a unified education program which will be                       
              introduced as early as possible in the curriculum for maximum                  
              benefit in the majority of courses where computer graphic                      
              simulation gives insight into complex phenomena.  The                          
              equipment includes six Interpro workstations and associated                    
              software.
