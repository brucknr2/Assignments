Abstract    :
              This project will establish a Macintosh microcomputer                          
              laboratory with software for two social science academic                       
              departments (the Department of Psychology and Sociology and the                
              Department of History, Political Science, and Geography) at                    
              Southern Arkansas University (Magnolia).  This laboratory will                 
              greatly increase access of students to hands-on techniques of                  
              quantitative, scientific analysis in these social science                      
              disciplines.  Ten microcomputers plus a network computer system                
              server and other appropriate hardware and software, including                  
              a statistical package and data sets, will enable students                      
              preparing for careers in secondary education and                               
              underrepresented groups to become active participants in the                   
              latest methodologies of their disciplines.  With this                          
              laboratory, existing courses in these departments will move                    
              from largely secondary study of social science quantitative                    
              methods to extended hands-on activity in designing and                         
              analyzing research problems, using large, real-life data sets                  
              and current, state-of-the-art hardware and software in                         
              computer-assisted statistical analysis.
