Abstract    :
              Quantitative analysis of economic data has become a central                    
              component of both public and private sector decision making.                   
              This project establishes a Computer Laboratory for Quantitative                
              Economic Analysis in order to provide students with hands-on                   
              data analysis opportunities in six undergraduate quantitative                  
              economics courses.  Housed within the Department's Economics                   
              Resource Center (a faculty supervised learning center staffed                  
              by students) the Laboratory will promote creative explorations                 
              in applied economic analysis, eschewing the traditional drills                 
              and rote exercises.  By encouraging original student research                  
              projects, the Laboratory will enrich student understanding of                  
              economic modeling and estimation techniques.  Exploiting the                   
              capabilities of personal computers and powerful statistical and                
              mathematical software, students will gain proficiency in                       
              applying analytical tools to a wide range of complex micro and                 
              macro-economic issues.  The overlapping use of hardware,                       
              software and data bases across the introductory and advanced                   
              quantitative economics classes will offer students a                           
              progressive learning environment in which to gain ever more                    
              sophisticated analytical skills.  Data collection and                          
              management skills will likewise be nurtured in the learning                    
              process.The award will be matched by an equal sum from the                     
              grantee.
