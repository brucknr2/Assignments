Abstract    :
              Beginning biology students served by this Community College System             
              often lack prior laboratory experience and suffer from "lab fear."             
              To provide more opportunity for hands-on laboratory training and               
              coaching by a teacher a Video Laboratory Enhancement System is                 
              being introduced into several courses thant rely heavily on                    
              microscopic observation and dissection.  The VLE system allows                 
              instructors to demonstrate to many students simultaneously, the                
              structure and organisms of interest so that the students can devote            
              more quality time on their own to independent laboratory                       
              observations and work.  The equipment will be shared among the six             
              colleges making up the community college system, and has the                   
              potential to impact on several thousand students annually, many of             
              whom are from groups that are currently underrepresented in the                
              sciences.
