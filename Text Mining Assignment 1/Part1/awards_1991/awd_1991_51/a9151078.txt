Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to strengthen the laboratory                 
              component of upper division courses in Vertebrate Physiology                   
              and Mammalogy.  A computer-interfaced metabolic system, the                    
              Eco-0xymax, allows the evaluation of V02, C02 and respiratory                  
              quotient as critical metabolic factors for studying the                        
              principles and adaptive mechanisms of metabolism in small                      
              mammals at the individual, population, and comparative levels.                 
              Animals collected from northwestern Wisconsin are studied to                   
              monitor their seasonal metabolic adjustments throughout the                    
              year.  The local environment, with its dramatic seasonal                       
              changes, serve as an "outdoor facility" that complements the                   
              laboratory aspects of the total exercise.  Students become                     
              directly involved with the use of computers and the role they                  
              play in the reduction, analysis, storage and retrieval of data.
