Abstract    :
              The department of physics is creating a new introductory level                 
              physics sequence of courses emphasizing laboratory experience.                 
              Building upon a new first-year course, which contains major                    
              units on 20th century physics, a sophomore level a course in                   
              Contemporary Physics focuses on recent important physics                       
              research results.  The contemporary physics laboratory is                      
              designed to give the students hands-on experience with                         
              fundamental ideas needed to understand the significance of the                 
              recent results.This project provides instrumentation for                       
              experiments in gamma ray and x-ray spectroscopy to illustrate                  
              basic concepts in nuclear and atomic physics. Six laboratory                   
              stations are provided with a personal computer-based                           
              multichannel analyzer and a scintillation detector or a low-                   
              energy germanium detector and associated electronics. The                      
              personal computers are also being used in interfacing to other                 
              physics instrumentation in the Sophomore laboratory. The                       
              spectroscopy equipment is sufficiently sophisticated for use in                
              advanced level student independent projects, including neutron                 
              activation analysis and x-ray fluorescence studies of trace                    
              elements.
