Abstract    :
              An optical measurement and analysis laboratory is being                        
              instrumented in support of the upper-level curriculum in an                    
              Engineering Physics Program.  The apparatus supplements basic                  
              instrumentation in a new laboratory facility.NSF grant funds                   
              are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
