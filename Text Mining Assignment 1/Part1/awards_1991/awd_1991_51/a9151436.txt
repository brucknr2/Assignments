Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is enhance an experimentally oriented                 
              curriculum that gives students experience in modern microscopy                 
              techniques.  The scanning electron microscope, an I.S.I. model                 
              ABT 55i, with WET-SEM capability and inherent ease of use by                   
              undergraduates, is being used in the introductory biology                      
              sequence, five upper division laboratory courses, and the                      
              student-oriented research program.  The instrument serves as                   
              the focal element in a curriculum designed to offer students a                 
              progression of vertically-integrated experiences with modern
