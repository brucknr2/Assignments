Abstract    :
              This project is intended to improve the laboratory experiences                 
              for students in two related areas of modern biology: cell and                  
              tissue culture and advanced microscopic technology.  The                       
              project has an impact on laboratory exercises, class projects                  
              and independent student research projects.  The acquisition of                 
              a class II, type A biological safety cabinet, and a humidified                 
              C02 incubator allows students to learn the techniques of                       
              starting cultures directly from plant or animal tissues and                    
              maintaining cell lines once established.  The six-foot work                    
              space also permits multiple student use and access for                         
              physically challenged students.  A quality photomicroscope                     
              equipped for phase contrast, fluorescence and darkfield                        
              microscopy, with a video display screen permits observations of                
              cultured and other cells and real time tape recording or                       
              recording on 35 mm film.  The video display is useful for                      
              learning disabled students who have difficulty processing                      
              visual information.
