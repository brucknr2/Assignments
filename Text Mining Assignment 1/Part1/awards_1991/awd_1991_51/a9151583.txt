Abstract    :
              This proposal requests the computing equipment and software                    
              necessary to convert a classroom at Towson State University                    
              into a Social Sciences Laboratory.  The lab will consist of                    
              twenty 80386/SX work-stations, two printers, projection                        
              equipment, a local area network, and system and application                    
              software.The laboratory will permit hands-on learning by                       
              students in statistical and simulation techniques used in                      
              social science research.  Currently there is no such facility                  
              on campus.  In political science, the laboratory will support                  
              research methods courses in statistics, system dynamics, and                   
              game theory as well as applied courses in international                        
              relations (using the ICONS simulation) and public policy.  In                  
              sociology and anthropology, the laboratory will support                        
              research methods courses required by sociology majors and                      
              provide vital tools for students in demography and                             
              anthropology.The proposed software provides both the user-                     
              friendly interface necessary for new computer users and the                    
              computing power needed for more advanced courses. The lab will                 
              be supported by faculty with experience in teaching computer                   
              applications and research methods and by the commitment of the                 
              University to encourage and expand student exposure to research                
              in the social sciences.
