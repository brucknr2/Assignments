Abstract    :
              Microcomputer-based lab activities are being integrated into                   
              the undergraduate mathematics curriculum.  The plan is driven                  
              by a philosophy drawn from the empirical sciences: deep                        
              laboratory exercises simulate the research process, and thereby                
              add a critical dimension to the growth of a scientist.  It is                  
              expected that the students emerge with a much broader                          
              qualitative understanding of the underlying mathematics.The                    
              laboratory is equipped with 20 Macintosh IIsi computers running                
              Mathematica, MathCAD, Minitab, and SAS/JMP; the lab is                         
              augmented with two Macintosh projection setups and a 2-unit                    
              preparation/consulting room.  A previously piloted lecture/lab                 
              calculus course is being implemented in all sections of the                    
              general calculus sequence, there are improved exercises and                    
              demonstrations in the computational modeling and statistics                    
              courses and a lab format is being introduced in differential                   
              equations and linear algebra.
