Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to produce scientifically literate                 
              individuals capable of recognizing, analyzing, and solving                     
              problems scientifically.  This is accomplished in part by                      
              training students in resource retrieval techniques that allow                  
              them to access scientific literature for decision making.                      
              Computer workstations capable of literature retrieval, data                    
              acquisition, statistical analysis, graphics presentation, and                  
              report editing allow students to critically analyze and                        
              logically present results from a variety of research projects,                 
              and to integrate language, computer, and mathematical skills                   
              into each research project.
