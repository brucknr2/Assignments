Abstract    :
              The addition of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (gc/ms)                  
              will improve instruction in chemical principles and the                        
              receptivity of students in learning these principles.  The                     
              gc/ms will be used in the organic lab to convincingly identify                 
              compounds.  The new experiments employing gc/ms support                        
              concepts taught in the lecture part of the course.  The                        
              physical chemistry laboratory curriculum will apply the theory                 
              of gas phase unimolecular reactions to the decomposition of                    
              ions in the mass spectrometer.  Instruction in instrumental                    
              analysis, advanced laboratory, and undergraduate research will                 
              also benefit from this acquisition.   The grantee will match                   
              the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
