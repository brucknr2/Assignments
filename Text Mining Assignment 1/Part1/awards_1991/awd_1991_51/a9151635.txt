Abstract    :
              This project develops a process control laboratory for                         
              undergraduate chemical engineering students with experimental                  
              equipment which consists of one tank (equipped with temperature                
              and level transmitters) and two other tanks which can simulate                 
              either interacting or non-interacting processes.  This                         
              equipment provides the capability that the system temperature                  
              and/or liquid-level in one of the tanks can be designated as                   
              control variables.  The manipulated variables can be inlet flow                
              and/or heat added to the tank via an electric immersion heater.                
              A personal computer is used for data acquisition and control.                  
              A wide range of experiments are performed in the undergraduate                 
              process control course and the transport operations laboratory.                
              These experiments vary in complexity from simple open-loop                     
              dynamics to advanced process control strategies.
