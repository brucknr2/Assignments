Abstract    :
              This is joint project by the Industrial Laboratory Technology                  
              Program and the Heating, Air Conditioning, Refrigeration                       
              Technology Program to improve student learning in the areas of                 
              instrumentation: sensors, transducers, signal conditioning,                    
              IEEE Interfacing, control devices, and computer collection,                    
              storage, analysis, and process control.  A                                     
              demonstration/instruction unit consisting of a heat pump                       
              package and an instrumentation package is produced and then                    
              used with faculty-developed lab exercises to train Industrial                  
              Lab students in a specific application (heating and air                        
              conditioning) while HVAC students gain experience with                         
              instrumentation and the relationships among important heat pump                
              operational parameters.  Learning objectives include the                       
              placement of temperature, pressure, flow, and level sensors;                   
              signal conditioning via the use of the IEEE interface; the                     
              logic related to the flow of information in a process; and the                 
              use of transducers in energy conversion.  Team teaching by                     
              faculty and team learning by students occur during the project.
