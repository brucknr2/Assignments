Abstract    :
              Introductory Botany is being revised so that students meeting                  
              the institutional requirement for a laboratory science course                  
              gain a better understanding of how scientists think and work.                  
              The large proportion of students at this institution who become                
              pre-college teachers particularly benefit from these                           
              experiences.  The dissection and compound microscopes are used                 
              in new and stimulating "hands-on" exercises that enrich a                      
              curriculum that deals with evolution, biometry, biomechanics,                  
              reproductive strategies, and the interaction and effects of                    
              environmental fluid dynamics on the evolution of plant                         
              structures.
