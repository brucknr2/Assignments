Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a gas                                
              chromatograph/mass spectrometer for undergraduate instruction                  
              and research. The instrument is being used in experiments                      
              investigating gas phase reactions in the Physical Chemistry                    
              Laboratory course, and the analysis of reaction mixtures and                   
              natural products in advanced courses in analytical and                         
              inorganic chemistry. Extensive use of the instrument is being                  
              made by undergraduate students engaged in research projects                    
              investigating the synthesis and structure studies of Schiff                    
              base coordination compounds as possible laser materials and the                
              synthesis of silicon compounds of theoretical interest.
