Abstract    :
              With the world of biotechnology changing our lives daily, it is                
              vital to transfer this new information to students as early in                 
              their academic careers as possible.  Three recombinant DNA labs                
              will be added to the current Microbiology and majors'                          
              Principles of Biology courses taught at Polk Community College                 
              to reinforce lectures on biotechnology theory and provide                      
              students immediate exposure to reecombinant DNA techniques.From                
              these new labs the student will learn the following:  to                       
              prepare and run an agarose gel, perform restriction analysis,                  
              produce competent cells, transform bacteria, perform proper                    
              measurement techniques to confirm data, and develop the                        
              critical thinking necessary to quantitative biology. The                       
              addition of new biotechnology laboratory exercises will                        
              strengthen several existing undergraduate courses.
