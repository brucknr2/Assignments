Abstract    :
              Participation in undergraduate research projects at                            
              thebeginning or honors level has become increasingly important                 
              at liberal arts institutions.  To significantly increase the                   
              number of students who participate in project activities, the                  
              physics department at Illinois Wesleyan University is upgrading                
              the type and quality of experiments offered in the junior level                
              Experimental Physics course.  Thus, familiarity with advanced                  
              equipment and techniques is allowing a natural progression into                
              senior research projects in which much of the same instrument-                 
              ation is used in more advanced ways.While the department offers                
              course work in all the usual areas of physics, faculty now have                
              clearly identified five weak areas in the experimental                         
              offerings -- those that can lead to senior research.  These                    
              areas, together with the equipment remedies made possible by                   
              this grant, are:  1) Modern Optics: the completion of a laser                  
              laboratory; 2) Low Temperature Physics (10-300 k): a general                   
              purpose gas refrigerator type cryostat; 3) Nuclear Physics: a                  
              high resolution gamma spectroscopy system 4) Solid State                       
              Physics: a small, accurate, general purpose magnet for Hall                    
              Effect and related measurements; 5) Observational Astronomy: an                
              astronomical photometer system to upgrade the department's                     
              unreliable, 21 year old system.NSF grant funds are being                       
              matched by funds from non-federal sources.
