Abstract    :
              This Computer-Aided Design laboratory provides students with                   
              improved career potential through the utilization of AutoCAD.                  
              The project enhances the existing Engineering Science Computer                 
              Lab and establishes a comprehensive CAD training facility that                 
              is representative of actual industrial CAD practices for the                   
              foreseeable future.  This project enables students to acquire                  
              hands-on experience in understanding traditional graphics and                  
              drafting topics.  Material taught primarily on CAD provides the                
              following curriculum improvements:  grids and coordinates, 3-D,                
              computer graphics, design principles, and electronic drafting.
