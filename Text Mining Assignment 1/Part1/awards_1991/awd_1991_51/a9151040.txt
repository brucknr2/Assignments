Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology is acquiring an x-ray diffractometer                 
              (XRD) to improve the laboratory part of the undergraduate                      
              geology curriculum.  The XRD is being used, along with the                     
              currently-owned electron microprobe and atomic absorption                      
              spectrometer, as the basis for a new senior-level course                       
              "Analytical Laboratory Techniques" to give undergraduates                      
              hands-on experience with these modern tools for analyzing                      
              geological materials.  In addition, the instrument is enriching                
              both the current sophomore and senior level mineralogy and                     
              petrology courses.
