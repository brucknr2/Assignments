Abstract    :
              Development of a Laser Laboratory at the University of Houston-                
              Clear Lake provides hands-on experience on electrooptics                       
              components and instruments for majors in the Electro-Optics                    
              program.  The laboratory uses a number of projects using                       
              various kinds of lasers such as argon ion, CO21, dye, HeNe, and                
              diode lasers.  Some of the projects involve the studies of                     
              resonator designs, beam parameters, and frequency                              
              characteristics of these lasers.  Others involve the                           
              applications of these lasers in holography, optical data                       
              storage, image processing, phase conjugation, harmonic                         
              generation, and self-focusing.  Short projects are used to form                
              a formal course "Electro-Optics Laboratory II" and the longer                  
              ones are used as "Independent Projects." In addition to the                    
              lasers mentioned above, some diagnostic instruments such as a                  
              digital oscilloscope, a personal computer, an spectrum                         
              analyzer, and a few detectors are used for the projects.  The                  
              developed Laser Laboratory serves as a "model" that can be                     
              ported to other schools who emphasize or offer programs in                     
              optics or photonics.
