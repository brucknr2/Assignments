Abstract    :
              This project upgrades and expands two presently offered                        
              laboratory courses in applied physics to three courses                         
              emphasizing laboratory techniques, data analysis and                           
              presentation.  Five computer data-acquisition workstations                     
              allow students to control experimental processes, to gather                    
              data for numerical analysis, and to prepare their final                        
              presentations.  Students are introduced to experiment design,                  
              numerical data analysis, statistical interpretation of data,                   
              experimental error, and minimum variance. Each workstation has                 
              traditional display outputs as well as computer-recorded                       
              outputs.
