Abstract    :
              The purpose of the project is to provide instrumentation in                    
              support of a newly organized senior-level course in                            
              experimental mechanics.  Topics covered include strain-gage                    
              measurements,  photoelastic modeling and strain measurements                   
              using photoelastic coatings, transmission two-dimensional                      
              models and three-dimensional model slice analysis.  Acquisition                
              of a transmission polariscope and supporting instrumentation                   
              supplement existing instrumentation for the strain-gage and                    
              photoelastic coating portion of the course.  The addition of                   
              this instrumentation permits the students to become familiar                   
              with the concepts of birefringence, retardation, polarization,                 
              isoclinics and isochromatics compensation, and the roles of                    
              both white light and monochromatic light.  Three-dimensional                   
              stress-freezing and slice analysis are performed by students                   
              utilizing the instrumentation.
