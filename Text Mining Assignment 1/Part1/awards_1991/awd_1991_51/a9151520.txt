Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 200 MHz FT-NMR for                 
              use in sophomore and higher level courses. Students in the                     
              first organic chemistry courses are using it in the                            
              determination of the dynamics and structures of milligram                      
              quantities of products obtained in the microscale organic                      
              laboratory. In advanced courses  2D techniques are employed in                 
              structure analysis of newly synthesized molecules.                             
              Additionally, the instrument is used extensively in the very                   
              active undergraduate research program.
