Abstract    :
              Southern College of Technology is adding an Automated Lightwave                
              Component Analysis System at its campus in Marietta, GA.  This                 
              new instrumentation system represents a major addition to the                  
              Wilder Communications Center. The Automated Lightwave Component                
              Analysis System gives the 1100 undergraduate students in the                   
              Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology department                      
              access to the latest in computer-controlled test                               
              instrumentation that is equivalent to that used in the                         
              lightwave communications industry. Southern Tech's students use                
              the system to study, in great detail, the performance of                       
              virtually any transmitter or receiver used in modern fiberoptic                
              voice, data and video communications systems throughout the                    
              world. Their studies include analysis of high-speed and high-                  
              power semiconductor lasers and of very sensitive photodiodes.                  
              In addition, the lightwave analysis instrumentation allows the                 
              students to completely characterize the end-to-end performance                 
              of entire fiberoptic systems including those designed and built                
              as projects by the students themselves.
