Abstract    :
              This project establishs a laboratory for studying computer                     
              networks using a small local area network.  In the past five                   
              years, both the pervasive use of networks throughout our                       
              society and the proliferation of local area networks in the                    
              business and industrial community demand that technology                       
              graduates be provided access to resources and instruction in                   
              computer networks.   A laboratory dedicated to the study of                    
              networks by both engineering technology and computer science                   
              technology students is being developed that consists of a 10-                  
              workstation local area network, a local area network analyzer                  
              computer, a remote access computer, operating system software                  
              and the necessary development software required for                            
              instruction.  Five different network courses will use the                      
              laboratory.  Students perform experiments which include                        
              network stress testing, collecting and analyzing network                       
              statistics and server application program design using client-                 
              server database.
