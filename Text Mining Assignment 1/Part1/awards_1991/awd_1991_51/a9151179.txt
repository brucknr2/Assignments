Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry and Physics is purchasing an FT-IR                 
              for use in all chemistry courses from the freshman level                       
              through senior independent research. The instrument is being                   
              used for product characterization, determination of the extent                 
              of a reaction, study of reaction mechanisms, and equilibrium                   
              bond distances and force constants.
