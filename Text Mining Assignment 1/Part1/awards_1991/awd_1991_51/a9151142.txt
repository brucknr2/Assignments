Abstract    :
              This project is called PARALLEL: Parallel Architecture                         
              ALgorithm and LanguagE Laboratory, and is the third, and last,                 
              phase of a general upgrading of the instructional laboratories                 
              within the Department of Computer Science.  This upgrading                     
              began with the establishment of lower division and upper                       
              division microcomputer laboratories in 1987 and 1989                           
              respectively.  The lower division laboratory has 20 small                      
              Macintosh computers and the upper division laboratory has 10                   
              Macintosh II stations; these laboratories were established with                
              grants from Apple Computer, Inc., and the National Science                     
              Foundation, and University of Arkansas money.  This project                    
              provides a low-cost parallel computing system consisting of a                  
              32 node Transputer based computer with a Macintosh II front-                   
              end.  The Transputer machine has the capability of switching                   
              the interconnection schema of the nodes between any of several                 
              standard ones such as mesh, n-cube, and perfect-shuffle.                       
              Experiments are being developed to provide students with                       
              experiences in the implementation of parallel architectures                    
              tailored to favor high performance of particular algorithms                    
              such as bitonic merge sort and the fast Fourier transform.
