Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to modernize a large introductory                  
              course for majors by exposing the students to current molecular                
              biological techniques and giving Honors students in the course                 
              the opportunity to do original research.  Electrophoresis                      
              equipment will be utilized to carry out DNA restriction                        
              analysis to identify the culprit in a hypothetical murder;                     
              students work though the biological principles involved and see                
              the application of these abstract ideas to a practical forensic                
              situation.  Fluorescence microscopes and microfuges are used in                
              the Honors section to allow students to isolate and                            
              characterize a new gene in yeast, and thus experience firsthand                
              the excitement of breaking new ground.
