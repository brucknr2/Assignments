Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Physical Sciences of West                    
              Texas State University is investigating the extent to which                    
              classroom instruction can be effectively carried out in a                      
              laboratory setting using computer-assisted data acquisition and                
              analysis.  During selected lectures, students are using                        
              personal computers, interface equipment, electronic sensors,                   
              and laboratory equipment to observe first-hand the physical                    
              systems being discussed and to demonstrate for themselves the                  
              interdependence of those systems' variables.  Initially, this                  
              portion of the project is studying the areas of motion, forces,                
              fields, and thermodynamics.Equipment purchased for this project                
              is also being used in regular physical science and physics                     
              laboratories and for student tutorials and interactive                         
              simulations.  Routine use of the computer lab is particularly                  
              important in acquainting prospective science educators with                    
              emerging educational technology.  The project is generating                    
              three comprehensive lab manuals--one for non-calculus physics                  
              that includes traditional experiments with modern technological                
              ones, a second version that is adapted for introductory                        
              physical science, and a third for public school                                
              application.Specific equipment being purchased with the funds                  
              include Gateway 3865X personal computers with disk drive and                   
              system software, SuperCHAMP universal interfaces, data                         
              acquisition and analysis software and sensors, color monitors,                 
              Toshiba 24-pin printers, Cenco air tracks, and a Hewlett                       
              Packard 6-pin plotter.NSF grant funds are being matched with                   
              funds from non-federal sources.
