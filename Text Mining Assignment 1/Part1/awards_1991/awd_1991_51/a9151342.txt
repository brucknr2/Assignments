Abstract    :
              The Department of Biology at Grinnell College is in the process                
              of revising its sophomore-level core course in Cell Biology. In                
              the past the laboratory consisted of a series of independent                   
              exercises where important techniques were learned but the                      
              experience was not unified in any way. We propose development                  
              of a series of sequential experiments unified around the study                 
              of cellular structure and function, made possible by                           
              fractionation of organelles. Laboratories are planned to                       
              prepare organelles from plant and animal tissues for the study                 
              of the activities of selected organelles such as oxygen                        
              consumption by isolated mitochondria, electron flow in isolated                
              chloroplasts, kinetic studies of marker enzymes for different                  
              cellular fractions, organization, and protein diversity in                     
              differentiated tissues.  All equipment necessary for these                     
              laboratories is available with the exception of an                             
              ultracentrifuge and rotors. We also propose updated experiments                
              in four upper-level courses where ultracentrifugation will be                  
              necessary for preparation of fractions for the study of plasma                 
              membrane function, plasmid isolation, purification of virus                    
              particles and examination of fractions by electron microscopy.                 
              The addition of an ultracentrifuge will make it possible for                   
              the department to broaden the firsthand experience of students                 
              with modern biological instrumentation.
