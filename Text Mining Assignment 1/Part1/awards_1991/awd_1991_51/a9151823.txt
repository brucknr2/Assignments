Abstract    :
              A UV-VIS spectrophotometer, an HPLC, and a GC instrument                       
              will be incorporated in courses in general chemistry, organic                  
              chemistry, and a new course to be developed in chromatography.                 
              The courses serve primarily to instruct students preparing for                 
              technical careers in basic science.  The new course in                         
              chromatography will be developed in collaboration with                         
              scientists at a local research institute.
