Abstract    :
              Through the acquisition of an educational x-ray system,                        
              computers, and a multichannel analyzer, students are being                     
              introduced to the study of x-ray emission, absorption and                      
              diffraction, and gamma ray spectroscopy.  The instruments are                  
              being interfaced with computers to give students familiarity                   
              with the use of the computer for data acquisition and analysis.                
              The availability of these instruments enhances the modern                      
              physics and advanced laboratory courses and provides a greater                 
              variety of undergraduate research opportunities for physics                    
              majors at Saint Vincent College.NSF grant funds are being
