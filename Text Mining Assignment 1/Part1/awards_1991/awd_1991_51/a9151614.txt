               Improvement of Instructional Resources in MathematicsThe                      
              instructional resources of the Mathematics Department have been                
              strengthened by the addition of a computer laboratory                          
              consisting of IBM PS/2, Model 55 SX computers running the                      
              computer algebra system Derive.  Students are able to work on                  
              more realistic problems at their own pace and deepen their                     
              understanding of the concepts of calculus by performing
