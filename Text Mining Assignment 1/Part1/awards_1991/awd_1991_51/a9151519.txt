Abstract    :
              The Physics/Physical Science Instrumentation project has four                  
              major objectives:  1) to acquire important equipment for the                   
              project, 2) to integrate computer data gathering and analysis                  
              experiences into the physics/physical science curriculum, 3) to                
              develop and implement a laboratory incorporating newly acquired                
              equipment, and 4) to present a project review at the area AAPT                 
              meeting (all materials and experiments relative to the project                 
              are being disseminated to other physics/physical science                       
              instructors.)By meeting the objectives of the project, the                     
              physics/physical science department is strengthening its                       
              offerings to students and preparing students for more of the                   
              requirements necessary to enter physics, physical science,                     
              engineering, medicine, or other science related classes in the                 
              four-year institutions.NSF grant funds are being matched with                  
              funds from non-federal sources.
