Abstract    :
              The Science and Mathematics Classroom of the Future at                         
              Maysville Community College is providing a network of computers                
              for a multidisciplinary project for students in mathematics,                   
              biology, chemistry, and physics courses.  Computer                             
              demonstrations and assignments are being made an integral part                 
              of course syllabi for designated mathematics and biology                       
              courses and are being used to a lesser extent in chemistry and                 
              physics classes.  Acquisition of computer equipment and the                    
              incorporation of computer technology into science and                          
              mathematics courses is enabling students to better appreciate                  
              and understand difficult science and mathematics topics                        
              encountered at Maysville Community College.  The incorporation                 
              of computer technology into all science disciplines is                         
              producing students who are prepared to use up-to-date                          
              technology at their transfer institutions.NSF grant funds are                  
              being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
