Abstract    :
              All students of Electrical Engineering at University of                        
              Evansville take a required year long Sophomore level lab course                
              sequence in basic electrical instrumentation.  This is a two                   
              course lab sequence which parallels the Sophomore Circuits                     
              sequence.  The sequence currently consists of a variety of                     
              canned experiments that cover the linear RLC circuit elements                  
              and linearized models of diodes and transistors.  Elementary                   
              digital and analog ICs are introduced.  This project provides                  
              a computer workstation with a spectrum analyzer to support a                   
              major coherent revision in this sequence including the junior                  
              level follow on courses.  The equipment requested permits the                  
              course to pull together very diverse topics such as RLC circuit                
              elements, ICs, transducers, frequency response, diodes,                        
              transistors, and amplifiers under a central audio theme.
