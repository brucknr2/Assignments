Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to upgrade the existing Human                       
              Development Lab and enhance courses in developmental                           
              psychology. social psychology, and research methods.  The                      
              proposed improvements will enable introductory and advanced                    
              level students to gain hands on experience using video and                     
              audio recording equipment combined with a variety of techniques                
              for data collection and analysis to investigate a wider range                  
              of topics. This project will improve the quality of the                        
              education and training students taking our courses receive and                 
              will assist us in preparing greater numbers of our majors for                  
              graduate education and research in the behavioral sciences.
