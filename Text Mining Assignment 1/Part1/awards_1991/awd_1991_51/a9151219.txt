Abstract    :
              The Department of geology is purchasing an energy dispersive                   
              analytical system accessory for their scanning electron                        
              microscope. Advanced undergraduate students are using the                      
              equipment to analyze individual mineral compositions as well as                
              accomplish semi-quantitative whole rock analyses.  The ability                 
              to use backscatter electron detection is enabling students to                  
              analyze fine grained rocks and study the intrapore mineral                     
              growth
