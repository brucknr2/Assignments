Abstract    :
              The Departments of Geology and Chemistry are purchasing an X-                  
              ray diffraction system for use by upper division geology and                   
              chemistry majors. The instrument is an integral part of the                    
              geology curriculum in the areas of Mineralogy, Crystallography,                
              Petrology and, Sedimentology. Students in Advanced Inorganic                   
              Chemistry courses use the instrument in the characterization of                
              transition metal compounds. Participation in undergraduate                     
              research is also increasing as a result of the availability of
