Abstract    :
              Napa Valley College, a comprehensive two-year community college                
              in Northern California, is utilizing NSF grant funds to develop                
              the Multi-Disciplinary Computer Laboratory Model for Community                 
              Colleges project.  The laboratory serves up to 2,000 students                  
              enrolled in the college's Science and Mathematics division, who                
              share a new state-of-the-art computer facility that is                         
              networked to the existing laboratories.Key faculty members from                
              Biology, Chemistry, Geography/Geology/Earth Sciences,                          
              Engineering, Mathematics and Physics are developing new lab                    
              curriculum and projects to introduce new concepts into science                 
              and math programs: talking electronic spreadsheet analysis,                    
              multi-media (graphics, text, video, and sound), electronic                     
              notebooks, laboratory report templates and electronic mail.                    
              The use of computers frees students from laborious and                         
              unenlightening computations so they can explore underlying                     
              principles and concepts.Funds are being used to purchase 10 new                
              NEXT computer workstations and upgrade the four existing                       
              systems on campus.  The new multi-disciplinary laboratory                      
              contains 10 workstations to serve a class of 30 students.  The                 
              remaining workstations are portable systems located in the                     
              science/math laboratories.The multi-disciplinary model is being                
              disseminated widely.  Colleges with small science and math                     
              programs that do not warrant individual labs benefit from the                  
              results of this project.NSF grant funds are being matched with                 
              funds from non-federal sources.
