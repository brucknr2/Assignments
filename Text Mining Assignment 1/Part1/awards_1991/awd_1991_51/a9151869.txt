Abstract    :
              The Department of Natural and Applied Sciences is purchasing                   
              spectrophotometers and chromatography equipment for use in both                
              lower and upper division courses.  The department is                           
              establishing a curriculum with an environmental theme                          
              throughout the four year program. The instruments are being                    
              used in the quantitative measurement of particulate matter,                    
              volatile organics, and trace metals in the biosphere.
