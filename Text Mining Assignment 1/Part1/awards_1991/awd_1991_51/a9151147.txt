Abstract    :
              A 200 MHz NMR spectrometer with 1H, 13C and 2D capability will                 
              be acquired to enhance undergraduate research and instruction.                 
              A Varian Gemini 200 Spectrometer will replace an obsolete and                  
              frequently inoperable 60 MHz CW instrument.  Several novel                     
              experiments for the FT-NMR instrument will extend beyond 1H NMR                
              in the organic chemistry courses.  It will be used intensively                 
              in organic chemistry instruction and will also be used in                      
              laboratory courses in analytical chemistry, biochemistry,                      
              inorganic chemistry and instrumental methods.  A number of                     
              current senior projects that cannot be done with the present                   
              instrument can be completed on a sensitive high field NMR.                     
              These include structural studies on an organochlorine compound                 
              from a Clitocybe mushroom, characterization of a sesquiterpene                 
              that smells like cedar from a Hygrophorous mushroom,                           
              characterization of a highly reactive aminobenzoquinone from a                 
              Lepiota mushroom, and further structural studies on buzonamine,                
              a novel epoxy-alkaloid from the millipede Buzonium crassipes.
