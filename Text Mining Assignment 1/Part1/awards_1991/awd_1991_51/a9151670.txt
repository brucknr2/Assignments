Abstract    :
              We have developed a new and innovative plant biology course for                
              non-science majors that will challenge our students to develop                 
              and use a scientific approach to problem solving.  Our                         
              laboratories are designed to teach the process of science by                   
              having students collect, organize, and interpret quantitative                  
              data.  Labs will also require students to formulate hypotheses                 
              and design experiments.  By using this approach, we hope to                    
              increase scientific literacy by giving our students skills to                  
              critically examine scientific data and to evaluate current                     
              scientific issues. Improvements to this course will                            
              significantly affect undergraduate education at the University                 
              of Maryland.
