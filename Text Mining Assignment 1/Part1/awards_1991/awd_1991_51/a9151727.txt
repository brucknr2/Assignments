Abstract    :
              This project affects laboratories in the areas of                              
              thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and heat transfer.  Through                    
              these courses students are exposed to the area of alternative                  
              fuels and automotive engineering, and learn to optimize engine                 
              performance and fuel economy.  The instruments involved can                    
              measure the concentration of exhaust gases such as CO, C02, 02,                
              NOx and total HC. Students learn to include environmental                      
              constraints throughout the design process, and also learn                      
              important measurement techniques.
