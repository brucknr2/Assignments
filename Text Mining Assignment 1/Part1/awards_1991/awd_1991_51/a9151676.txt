Abstract    :
              An undergraduate lab unit in composite materials, part of a                    
              mechanical and aeronautical engineering laboratory course, is                  
              being established.  The fundamental ideas demonstrated include                 
              the facts that composites are engineered materials, built from                 
              constituent building blocks, that their microstructure is                      
              widely tailorable and has a dramatic influence on properties,                  
              that the properties are strongly anisotropic, and that                         
              composite materials are part of an engineering loop which                      
              involves constituent properties, processing, and                               
              microstructure.  To vividly illustrate these ideas students                    
              make composite specimens, measure their microstructural                        
              features, test their mechanical properties, and look at the                    
              inextricable interactions between all three.  A unique feature                 
              of this lab is the use of computer-aided image processing as a                 
              technique to quantify the complex microstructures of                           
              composites.  As a result of this lab students have a greatly                   
              improved sense of how composite materials truly are engineered                 
              materials, and are better prepared to incorporate composite                    
              materials into their future engineering.
