Abstract    :
              The scanning electron microscope (SEM), used in the Composite                  
              Materials Engineering program, affects the currently offered                   
              courses of Mechanical Characterization Laboratory, Process                     
              Design I and II, Surface Analysis, Composite Characterization                  
              Techniques, and Mechanics of Composites.  The equipment better                 
              prepares students through hands-on experience and provides                     
              opportunities for undergraduate research activities.  Also, new                
              courses such as Failure Analysis and Formulations which utilize                
              scanning electron microscopy are developed.
