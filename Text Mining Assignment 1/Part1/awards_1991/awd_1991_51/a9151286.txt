Abstract    :
              Southwest Texas State University is creating an x-ray                          
              crystallography laboratory for structure determination of                      
              inorganic/organometallic compounds in the advanced inorganic                   
              chemistry courses and undergraduate research.Single crystals of                
              interesting compounds are obtained from their own undergraduate                
              research laboratories and those at cooperating institutions
