Abstract    :
              Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is rapidly becoming an                         
              invaluable research tool with applications in fields as diverse                
              as molecular biology, medicine and forensics.  We feel that the                
              introduction of PCR technology into our undergraduate                          
              curriculum is essential to maintain our practice of teaching                   
              current research techniques in molecular biophyscis and                        
              biochemistry. Especially those that are in widespread use and                  
              are likely to be encountered by our students in their future                   
              careers.  We are requesting funding to purchase the temperature                
              cycler needed for the repetitive denaturation and renaturation                 
              steps that form the basis of this technique.We are also                        
              requesting funds to purchase a spectrophotometer to be used to                 
              teach a variety of topics including introductory and advanced                  
              enzyme kinetics and investigations into the optical properties                 
              of nucleic acids, e.g. thermal denaturationEach of these pieces                
              of equipment will be used in undergraduate teaching labs at                    
              Yale University both semesters of the academic year by majors                  
              and non-majors alike.
