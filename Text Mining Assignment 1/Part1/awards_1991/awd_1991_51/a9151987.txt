Abstract    :
              This project addresses undergraduate instruction in the areas                  
              of machine dynamics and vibration.  It supports implementation                 
              of modern modal analysis equipment and software into the                       
              mechanical vibrations, kinematics and dynamics of machines, and                
              engineering materials courses. A Bruel & Kjaer model 2034A Dual                
              Channel Analyzer, a Dell 333D personal computer, SMS Star modal                
              analysis software, and ancillary equipment are involved.  The                  
              dual channel analyzer enables students to determine natural                    
              frequencies, mode shapes, and damping properties for realistic                 
              structures using modern modal analysis techniques. The SMS Star                
              software, running on the Dell 333D personal computer, is used                  
              to animate the experimentally determined vibration modes to                    
              allow visualization of the vibratory behavior of the structure                 
              undergoing the test.  Additionally, the software enables design                
              oriented questions pertaining to structural modifications to be                
              posed and simulates the results of such changes using 3-D                      
              graphical displays.
