Abstract    :
              Students are developing an active, experimental approach to                    
              calculus and its applications through utilization of a Computer                
              Algebra System in conjunction with problem solving.  The major                 
              instruments of the project are a 25 workstation computer                       
              laboratory on a local area network, augmented by portable                      
              computers with overhead displays for classroom demonstrations,                 
              and desktop computers for faculty use for student                              
              consultations, demonstrations, and material development.
