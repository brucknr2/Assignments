Abstract    :
              This project is facilitating the acquisition of equipment                      
              needed to develop seven modern optics experiments in the                       
              general areas of fiber optics, holography, and interferometry                  
              for the advanced laboratory in optics taught by the Physics                    
              Department.  Titles of the experiments being developed in this                 
              project are: (1) Introduction to Fiber Optics, (2) The                         
              Measurement of Birefringence in a Low-Birefrinqent Fiber, (3)                  
              Two Beam Fiber Optic Interferometry, (4) Multi-Beam Fiber Optic                
              Interferometry, (5) Frequency Modulation of a Laser Diode, (6)                 
              Making Holograms, and (7) Hetrodyne Interferometry.  These                     
              seven modern optics experiments are combined with three                        
              experiments currently available to create an advanced physics                  
              laboratory which integrates classical and modern optics in a                   
              systematic way.  The major equipment items purchased are: a 25                 
              mw HeNe laser that is used to make quality holograms and do                    
              holographic interferometry; a high frequency spectrum analyzer                 
              to analyze the hetrodyne output of both classical and fiber                    
              interferometers; a confocal Fabry-Perot to be used as a high                   
              resolution optical analyzer for frequency analysis of diode                    
              lasers; and a floating optical table on which to mount the                     
              holography experiments.NSF grant funds are being matched with                  
              funds from non-federal sources.
