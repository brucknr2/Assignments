Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to establish a computer                         
              numerically controlled (CNC) machine tool laboratory, which                    
              provides the opportunity for students to study computer-aided                  
              manufacturing (CAM) methods. Purchases include a small CNC                     
              milling machine, computer, software, and accessories. Students                 
              study machining methods and computer-aided drafting (CAD).  The                
              equipment allows students to design parts using CAD, transfer                  
              that information to the CNC machine, and the part will then be                 
              made by the machine.
