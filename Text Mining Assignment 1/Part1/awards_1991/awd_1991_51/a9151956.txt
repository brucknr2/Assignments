Abstract    :
              Instrumental analysis students will perform atomic absorption                  
              analyses on real life samples (e.g., wear metals in engine                     
              oils) with the aid of a sensitive instrument equipped with a                   
              graphite furnace.  Sophomore students in quantitative analysis                 
              will use a flame atomization source with the same instrument.                  
                These specific, sensitive, realistic laboratory analyses will                
              improve the instruction of a large number of science majors who                
              form an important cadre of analytical chemists in local                        
              industry.The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal                 
              funds.
