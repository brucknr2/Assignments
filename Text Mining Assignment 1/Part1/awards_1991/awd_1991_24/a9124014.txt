Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research aimed at elucidating principles that underlie             
              the conservation and restoration of biological diversity is of                 
              utmost importance.  This is the priority of Dr. Owen's research                
              program.  The goal of this project is to continue his work at the              
              Santa Rosa National Park in Costa Rica on an endangered marine                 
              species.  These animals and several other large vertebrates in the             
              region are under severe over exploitation and accidental capture               
              pressure in their oceanic environment which, in turn, is causing               
              dramatic drops in their population.  Previous NSF support has                  
              resulted in state-of-the-art research on some of the most difficult            
              problems in marine animal biology.  Dr. Owens will now employ small            
              satellite, sonic and radio transmitters to monitor the migratory               
              behavior of these sea-going animals.  In addition, he will measure             
              the level of steroid hormones to determine the correlation between             
              endocrine physiology and reproductive and migratory behaviors.  A              
              major collaborative research effort has been established between               
              Dr. Owens and Costa Rican students and scientists.  Their goal is              
              to gain new insights into understanding the conservation of these              
              animals within their natural habitat.  The outcome of this work                
              will not only provide a more complete understanding of their basic             
              biology but may lead to improvement in the conservation and                    
              survival prospects for this economically valuable marine species.
