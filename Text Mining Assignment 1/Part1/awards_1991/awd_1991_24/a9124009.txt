Abstract    :
                   The project's goal is to investigate the asymptotic                       
              estimation problem when the number of nuisance parameters                      
              increases with the number of observations. The application of the              
              obtained results to multidimensional sensor array processing is                
              expected. The aim here is to determine the best possible                       
              asymptotic performance and to give a method for constructing an                
              estimator exhibiting this behavior.  Similar questions will be                 
              studied in a version of the change-point estimation problem and                
              admissibility conditions under Pitman closeness for generalized                
              Bayes estimators will be derived. The relationship between prior               
              distribution and the shape of the frequentist risk of the                      
              corresponding Bayes estimator will be also investigated.                       
                   This proposal is directed towards finding new methods of                  
              obtaining optimal statistical procedures with the application to               
              signal processing.
