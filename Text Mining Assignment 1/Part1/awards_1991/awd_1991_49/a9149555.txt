Abstract    :
                   Work sponsored by this Presidential Young Investigator Award              
              will focus primarily on questions arising in the applications of               
              mathematics to problems of elasticity and liquid crystals, to                  
              geometric problems related to the study of curvature on manifolds              
              with boundary.                                                                 
                   The problems to be addressed are presented in terms of                    
              various partial differential equations arising either from                     
              physical considerations - minimization of functionals or                       
              variational inequalities, or are motivated by geometrical                      
              concepts.  The latter include the problem of finding a metric on               
              a manifold with prescribed Ricci tensor.  This problem is                      
              studied locally or globally through the analysis of systems of                 
              elliptic equations.  In the Hodge theory, the problem reduces to               
              that of solving the boundary regularity of solutions of                        
              degenerate elliptic systems.  For a single equation, the problem               
              has recently been settled.                                                     
                   Focus of the elasticity (plasticity) studies will be on                   
              the Singonolli problem, seeking the best possible regularity                   
              of vector valued functions which solve obstacle problems.  In                  
              liquid crystals many physical properties such as line                          
              singularities, phase transition, and moving defects, may be                    
              explained within a comprehensive theory.  Related work will be                 
              done on studies of the corresponding dynamical equations.  In an               
              isotropic case, these problems reduce tot he analysis of heat                  
              flow of harmonic maps and to harmonic maps from Minkowski space                
              to singular target manifolds.
