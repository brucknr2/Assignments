Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study mineral-fluid interface                  
              geochemistry utilizing atomic force and scanning tunneling                     
              microscopic and spectroscopic techniques.  The ability to                      
              actually "see" individual atoms at mineral interfaces will likely              
              to lead to a more fundamental understanding of mineral surfaces                
              and their reactivity, and ultimately will have a wide range of                 
              applications in the earth and environmental sciences.
