Abstract    :
              The Rio Grande Rift is a major tectonic and volcanic feature of                
              the southwestern United States.  The study proposed here will                  
              characterize the petrology and geochemistry of late Cenozoic                   
              lavas in the southern New Mexico portion of the Rift.  Emphasis                
              will be place on the dynamics of melt generation in continental                
              rift zones and the chemical and isotopic nature of the                         
              subcontinental mantle.  There have been a number of geochemical                
              studies in the northern portion; the southern part has had few                 
              studies of comparable detail.  This is the first stage of a study              
              which will attempt to remedy the deficiency with detailed                      
              stratigraphic study of three different fields in southern New                  
              Mexico.  Major-and trace-element compositions of the lavas,                    
              phenocrysts, xenocrysts, and mantle-derived xenoliths will be                  
              used to model source lithology, depth of magma generation, and                 
              melt evolution.
