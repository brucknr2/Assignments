Abstract    :
                This research is an extension from current results by this                   
              group of determination of P-wave velocities in the earth's                     
              mantle.  New emphasis will be on determination of resolution of                
              the P-wave results and the incorporation of S-wave data.  For                  
              further refinements, the ISC earthquake catalog will be relocated              
              and special attention will be paid to subduction zones which are               
              critical to the inversion.  The 3-D map of velocities are a key                
              indicator of mantle convection which is the primary driving force              
              of plate tectonics and earthquake occurrence.  This research is a              
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
