Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research program is designed to examine the                       
              fundamentals of both interfacial carbide precipitation and                     
              precipitation of carbides within a grain matrix in 316                         
              stainless steel.  Researcher, including engineers and                          
              minority students at the University of Texas, will compare                     
              the geometrical and crystallographic features of 316                           
              stainless steel with martensite nucleation in 304 stainless                    
              steel.  Their task will be to determine whether specific                       
              interfacial sites for precipitation of carbides are also                       
              specific for martensite nucleation, and whether invariant                      
              strain intersections within the grains (which are specific to                  
              alpha prime-martensite nucleation in 304 stainless steel) are                  
              precipitation nucleation sites in 316 stainless steel.                         
              Practical consequences of developing a fundamental                             
              understanding of the deformation-induced sensitization and                     
              precipitation mechanisms will be examined in the context of                    
              potential alloy modification and modeling of potential                         
              hazards imposed by storing and transporting hazardous and                      
              corrosive wastes in stainless steel containers or pipeline                     
              systems.
