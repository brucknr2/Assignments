Abstract    :
              The long range goals of this research are to define at the                     
              molecular level the expression of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)             
              genome. Specific focus has been on the regulation of expression of             
              three representative early transcription units including the major             
              2.7 kb and 1.2 kb RNAs and the 2.2kb family of transcripts.  In                
              this application, the PI proposes to continue studies on the cis-              
              acting sequences and trans-acting factors (both viral and cellular)            
              necessary for the control of these three early genes.  For these               
              studies, site-directed mutagenesis and in vivo transient expression            
              assays will be coupled with DNA-protein binding and in vitro                   
              transcription assays. To elucidate the means by which specific HCMV            
              immediate early gene products (particularly those expressed by the             
              IE1 and IE2 regions) activate transcription of early genes. The                
              proteins will be overexpressed, purify them to homogeneity, and                
              analyze  their biochemical interaction with the early promoter                 
              elements as well as with the basic RNA polymerase II transcription             
              machinery. The proposed studies are important not only to advance              
              the knowledge of the regulation of the viral life cycle, but also              
              to help elucidate the general mechanisms that operate to control               
              eukaryotic gene expression.
