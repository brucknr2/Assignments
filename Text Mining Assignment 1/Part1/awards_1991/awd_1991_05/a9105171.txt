Abstract    :
                   The 1991 symposium will be the twenty-fourth in an annual                 
              series.  It will be held in San Antonio, Texas in August, and its              
              theme is Theoretical Approaches for Predicting Spatial Effects in              
              Ecological Systems.  Topics included are the use of diffusion                  
              based models to predict the movement and distribution of animal                
              populations, the use of renormalization theory to develop scale-               
              independent spatial models, non-linear Markov models for                       
              simulating landscape changes, the development and application of               
              spatial ecosystem models for estimating long-term ecological                   
              effects, the effect of economic policies on the spatial patterns               
              of land-use, and the use of percolation theory to examine the                  
              effects of spatial heterogeneity.                                              
                   The overall goal of the symposium is to expose biologists to              
              recent theoretical work by mathematicians, and to expose                       
              mathematicians to some of the key problems and constraints faced               
              by ecologists in the analysis and simulation of ecological                     
              systems.
