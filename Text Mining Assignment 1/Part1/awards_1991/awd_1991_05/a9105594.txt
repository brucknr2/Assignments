Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Control of cell proliferation is a basic biological problem central            
              to the understanding of development and growth.  Hormone-responsive            
              cells are a good model to study this regulatory phenomenon.  Three             
              working hypotheses have been proposed to explain estrogen (E)                  
              induction of cell proliferation:  a) E acts directly, b) E acts                
              through the induction of growth factors, and c) that E neutralize              
              the action of a plasma-borne inhibitor.  Evidence supporting                   
              hypothesis c) has been gathered in recent years; these data                    
              indicate that the inhibitor is blood-borne and cell-type specific.             
              Progress in this area of research requires that the putative                   
              inhibitor be purified.  This will provide the tools to test which              
              hypothesis is correct, and a better understanding of the mechanisms            
              that control cell proliferation in multicellular organisms.                    
                                                                                             
              Goals of this proposal are:  l) to obtain a highly purified                    
              preparation of the plasma-borne inhibitor, 2) to obtain specific               
              monoclonal antibodies using this preparation; and 3) to gather                 
              amino acid sequence information to ascertain the molecular identify            
              of the inhibitor.//
