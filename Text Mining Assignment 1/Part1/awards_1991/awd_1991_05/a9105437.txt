Abstract    :
                   An approach to scientific computation is proposed that                    
              incorporates research in numerical analysis, aspects of computer               
              science, and solution of model problems in mechanics.  Three                   
              research areas are the focus of the proposal:   computational                  
              problems in incompressible fluid dynamics (including                           
              free-boundary problems, problems with variable density and                     
              high-order discretizations in three dimensions), computational                 
              chemistry (molecular dynamics simulations), and automated                      
              programming of scientific algorithms on parallel computers.  The               
              overall objective of the proposal is to improve the foundations                
              for software for solving problems in science and technology that               
              involve large scale, multidimensional models involving                         
              mechanics.  The research will involve the development of new                   
              algorithms for several problems too difficult to solve by                      
              existing techniques.  It will also include an analysis of each                 
              algorithm, yielding a rigorous justification that it accurately                
              approximates the phenomena under study. Finally, the proposed                  
              research will involve prototype implementations of                             
              the algorithms in computer programs via techniques that can                    
              assure a robust and easliy maintained code.                                    
                                                                                             
              This research will improve computational modeling of many                      
              important industrial processes.  One class involves such diverse               
              things as making photographic film, sewing thread, extruded                    
              metals and Saran Wrap.  Another involves biomedical applications,              
              for example in the development of new pharmaceuticals.  Another                
              impacts the analysis of certain toxic gas spills.
