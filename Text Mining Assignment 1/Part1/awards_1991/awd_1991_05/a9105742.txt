Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's will maintain a project office for the               
              US component of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).                 
              During the operational phase of WOCE, the office will provide                  
              assistance to the Interagency Panel, and staff support for the US              
              Science Steering Committee and its subcommittees, and individual               
              scientists.  The principal tasks involve communication, both among             
              US PI's and with the International Project Office, the Data                    
              Information Unit, and the WOCE Hydrographic Program Office.                    
              Annual budget requests for the entire US WOCE program and annual               
              updates to the US WOCE Implementation Plan will be made.
