Abstract    :
                 This research is concerned with developing new modulation,                  
              detection, and coding systems for increasing the density of                    
              reliable digital data storage and retrieval on magnetic media.  In             
              order to design better and more efficient signal processing systems            
              a thorough knowledge of the signal and noise characteristics of the            
              storage channel must be obtained.  Thus experimental data will be              
              collected to better characterize the input-output characteristics              
              of the channel.  In particular, emphasis will be placed on                     
              measuring effects that occur at high recording densities, e.g.,                
              signal nonlinearities.  Based on these measurements, mathematical              
              models will be developed which describe the input-output                       
              characteristics of the channel.  These models will be used to                  
              suggest improved modulation, detection, and coding systems.  The               
              performance of these systems will be evaluated based upon these                
              models and compared to alternative systems.
