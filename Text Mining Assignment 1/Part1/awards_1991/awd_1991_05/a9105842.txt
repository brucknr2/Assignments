Abstract    :
                   The history of paleoclimate in East Africa is poorly known.               
              Continental rifting in this region has produced a series of large              
              lakes that span many climate regimes.  If these lakes are shown                
              to contain useful paleoclimate records, then much important                    
              information about the history of earth's climate could be                      
              obtained.  The purpose of this research is to evaluate the                     
              potential of Lake Turkana, Kenya, for paleoclimate                             
              reconstructions.  Sediments in this lake are accumulating                      
              at high rates, often in laminations that reflect the annual cycle              
              of productivity and sedimentation.  Thus the lake has the                      
              potential of allowing reconstruction of the history of climate in              
              this region on annual to century time scales for the last 5000                 
              years.  This research is important because it will provide a high              
              resolution climate record from which to study climate processes                
              and change.
