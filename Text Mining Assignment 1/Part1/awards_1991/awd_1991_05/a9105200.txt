Abstract    :
                   This meeting will explore recent developments in the basic                
              physics and applications of the short-wavelength radiation                     
              generated by high-intensity laser-matter interactions.  Topics to              
              be addressed include high-intensity multiphoton phenomena in                   
              atoms and plasmas, new developments in high throughput and high                
              resolution x-ray optics, and new sources of XUV and X radiations.
