Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to complete the analysis of moored acoustic current             
              measurements from the Gulf Stream gathered as part the joint                   
              NSF/ONR Synoptic Ocean Prediction (SYNOP) program.  The                        
              investigation centers on the regional energetics and eddy-mean flow            
              interaction in the large meandering region of the Gulf Stream.
