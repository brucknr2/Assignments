Abstract    :
                This research is to develop a new technique for mapping the                  
              geometry and internal properties of fault zones by means of seismic            
              waves travelling inside the low-velocity wave guide of the fault               
              zone.  For vertical faults such as the San Andreas, conventional               
              seismic reflection and refraction techniques have not met with much            
              success.  The use of dispersive properties of trapped modes should             
              lead to a better delineation of the fault zone, and a better                   
              understanding of the source rupture process and the process of                 
              earthquake occurrence.  The work will consist of both field                    
              observations and theoretical modeling of the trapped modes.  This              
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction            
              Program.
