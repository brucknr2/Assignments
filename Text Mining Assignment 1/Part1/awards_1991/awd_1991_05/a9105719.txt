Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              (A).  Basic Aspect:                                                            
                                                                                             
                      This project is aimed at studying the mechanism of                     
              regulation of growth hormone gene expression at the molecular level            
              in the fish system.  Specifically, studies will be conducted to:               
              (i) identify factors that regulate the expression of GH genes, and             
              (ii) to elucidate the molecular mechanism of tissue specific and               
              developmental stage specific expression of these genes.                        
                                                                                             
              (B).  Applied Aspect:                                                          
                                                                                             
                      Successful growth and development in finfish and shellfish             
              is a prerequisite for the success of aquaculture.  Knowledge of                
              unequivocal identification and understanding factors that regulate             
              the expression of fish GH genes will facilitate designing of                   
              realistic strategies for enhancing the growth rates of finfish and             
              shellfish in aquaculture operations.//
