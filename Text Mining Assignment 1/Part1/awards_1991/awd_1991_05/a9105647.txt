Abstract    :
                    This project is concerned with the theory and design of                  
              structured vector quantizers for the compression and storage of                
              analog sources such as speech, images, video, and music.  Vector               
              quantization is a class of techniques that holds significant                   
              promise for significant gains over recent compression techniques.              
              The difficulty with vector quantizers is the high degree of                    
              complexity involved in implementations. The focus of this project              
              is the development of a theory of reduced complexity vector                    
              quantizers.  Asymptotic quantization theory is to be further                   
              developed and used to analyze the performance of moderate to high              
              rate structured quantizers.  New methods for analyzing the                     
              performance of low rate quantizers are being studied.  The                     
              fundamental limits of performance versus structure are being                   
              explored.
