Abstract    :
                      The derivation of terrestrial paleotemperatures is complicated         
              because there are few indicators of climate that are solely related to         
              temperature.  As a result there are discrepencies between estimates            
              based on different methods.  Furthermore, there is a serious difference        
              between temperatures estimated for the marine and terrestrial tropics          
              during the last glaciation.  This proposal presents a novel approach to        
              reconstruct paleotemperatures in terrestrial environments.  It is based        
              on the known temperature dependence of the solubility of noble gases in        
              water.  By sampling 20,000 year old water in two aquifers, the PIs will        
              be able to estimate past temperatures by determining their noble gas           
              concentration.  This research is important because the new method is           
              based on sound chemical principles and it will help to resolve important       
              discrepencies between other estimates of glacial surface temperatures.
