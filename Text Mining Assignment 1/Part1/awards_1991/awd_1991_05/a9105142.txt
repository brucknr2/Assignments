Abstract    :
              The broad objective of this proposal is to elucidate the                       
              mechanisms which control the activation of stored maternal mRNAs               
              at fertilization in sea urchin eggs.  These RNAs are stored as                 
              translationally repressed messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes                
              (mRNPs).  A change in intracellular Ca or pH levels or the                     
              activation of protein kinase C in some manner alters the                       
              structure of the egg mRNPs at fertilization, resulting in their                
              translational activation.  The PI proposes to analyze in detail                
              the factors that control the repression and derepression of                    
              stored maternal mRNPs.  mPNP proteins involved in translation                  
              repression will be identified by by comparing the protein                      
              patterns of purified inactive and active poly A (+) mRNPs.  In                 
              addition, mRNP binding proteins will be isolated from in vitro                 
              activated egg mRNPs.  Antibodies against these mRNP masking                    
              factors will be used to monitor changes in mRNP proteins upon                  
              mRNP activation at fertilization.  Protein kinase C activation or              
              intracellular calcium changes result in the unmasking of egg                   
              mRNPs.  These changes may activate a cascade of protein                        
              phosphorylation reactions.  The PI will examine the potential                  
              role of phosphorylation in the activation of egg mRNPs both in                 
              vivo and in a sea urchin in vitro translation system.
