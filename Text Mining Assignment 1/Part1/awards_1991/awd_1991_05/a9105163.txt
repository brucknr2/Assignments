Abstract    :
              The aim of the research described is to develop transformed plant              
              varieties with enhanced freezing tolerance through the expression              
              of antifreeze proteins that inhibit ice crystal growth.  We have               
              shown that tobacco and tomato plants transformed with a winter                 
              flounder antifreeze gene express high levels of the corresponding              
              mRNA.  Furthermore, the gene was modified so that the encoded                  
              protein is larger and more readily detected.  In plants containing             
              this fusion protein, antifreeze expression was observed at the RNA,            
              protein and activity level, with transcriptional levels                        
              predominating.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              We will now evaluate the impact of antifreeze protein on the                   
              freezing tolerance properties of fruit from transgenic plants as               
              well as from nontransgenic fruits that have been infiltrated with              
              antifreeze protein.  If necessary, we will optimize the protein                
              concentration in plant tissue by enhancing protein activity,                   
              protein stability, transcription, and translatability.                         
              Constructions resulting in optimal freezing tolerance will be                  
              transferred into appropriate commercial varieties.***//
