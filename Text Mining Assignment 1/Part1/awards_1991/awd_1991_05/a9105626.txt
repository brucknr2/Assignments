Abstract    :
                   Approximation theory has been an important branch of                      
              mathematics for over 100 years; the mathematics involved ranges                
              from the very abstract to the very applied.  Several new research              
              areas such as computer-aided geometric design and robotics depend              
              heavily on tools from approximation theory.  Some of the most                  
              currently active research areas in approximation theory are                    
              wavelets, multivariate splines, multivariate data fitting,                     
              orthogonal polynomials, rational approximation, abstract                       
              approximation, modern moduli of smoothness, and computer-aided                 
              geometric design.                                                              
                   This project will support the Seventh International                       
              Symposium on Approximation Theory, to be held January 3-7, 1992                
              at the University of Texas at Austin.  The conference will                     
              include 9 one-hour invited survey lectures and over 100 sessions               
              for contributed papers.  A volume of conference proceedings is                 
              planned.
