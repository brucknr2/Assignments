Abstract    :
              The Department of Systems Science and Mathematics at Washington                
              University, St. Louis, will purchase Sun Microsystems Graphics                 
              Workstation equipment which will be dedicated to the support of                
              research in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be                  
              used for several research projects, including in particular:                   
                                                                                             
              1. Computational theory of Riccati partial differential                        
              equations, fundamental to the control of nonlinear systems,                    
              directed especially to a visualization of their classical blow-                
              ups and nonlinear shock waves;                                                 
                                                                                             
              2. Optimization for probabilistic systems, in which the objective              
              function is estimated by Monte Carlo simulation, which is                      
              computation intensive;                                                         
                                                                                             
              3. The p-version of the finite element method, pioneered here and              
              now being extended to nonlinear and time-varying problems;                     
                                                                                             
              4. Symbolic algebraic computation for nonlinear control theory,                
              using Lie algebra and formal power series methods, and numerical               
              experimentation with resulting new invariant-preserving                        
              integration methods, with graphic output.
