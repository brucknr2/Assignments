Abstract    :
                   The goal of the proposed research is to further our                       
              understanding of the role spatial information plays in regulating              
              embryo development and the transition to germination in higher                 
              plants. The approach will be to use molecular probes and in situ               
              localization techniques to look at the cellular basis for                      
              patterns of gene expression in Brassica napus embryos, and to                  
              examine how these patterns change over the course of development.              
              An important consequence of this research will be there                        
              identification of clones that can be used to look at the                       
              molecular anatomy of the processes that appear to involve pattern              
              formation, particularly the determination of the shoot apical                  
              meristem during early embryogenesis and the determination of                   
              organ identity at the shoot apex during precocious germination.                
              These clones can also be used, in combination with genetic                     
              analysis of developmental mutants in Arabdopsis to dissect the                 
              mechanisms of pattern formation in plant embryos.
