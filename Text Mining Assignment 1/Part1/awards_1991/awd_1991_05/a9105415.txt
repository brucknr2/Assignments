Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The regulatory effect of phosphorylation on a plant nuclear factor,            
              GBF-1 from Arabidopsis, that affects expression of light-inducible             
              genes is the focus of this study.  Characterization of this                    
              phosphorylation reaction, from broccoli nuclear extracts, and its              
              biological significance will be the main emphasis.  Cloned GBF-1,              
              overexpressed in bacteria, will be used as substrate for the                   
              kinase, and stoichiometry of phosphorylation, identification of                
              phosphorylated amino acids, and mapping of phosphorylation sites               
              will be examined with purified kinase.  In vivo studies of light               
              effects on phosphorylation of GBF-1 will also be undertaken as part            
              of the study of light-responsive gene expression.
