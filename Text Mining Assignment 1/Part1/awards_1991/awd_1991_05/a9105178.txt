Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Biaxial creep behavior is studied in hexagonal close packed metals             
              and alloys that have been processed with varied textures,                      
              microstructures, and operating slip systems.  Investigations on the            
              transitional creep mechanisms from power law to viscous creep and              
              the effects of texture on these transitions are being examined.                
              Several metals and alloys have been selected for the studies to                
              provide materials with vastly different textures.  Microstructural             
              studies are accomplished using scanning transmission electron                  
              microscopy to determine dislocation structures and optical                     
              metallography to aid in slip trace analysis.                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The research is seen as valuable to the high temperature use of                
              metal alloys and for better understanding of their behavior under              
              biaxial stresses.  Hexagonal close packed metals are used in                   
              aerospace and energy industries where they are exposed to high                 
              temperatures and complex loading conditions.  Improved                         
              understanding of creep under these conditions should lead to                   
              techniques to take advantage of textural hardening and to predict              
              anisotropic deformation.
