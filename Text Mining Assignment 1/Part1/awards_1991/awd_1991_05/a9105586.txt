Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research is proposed in the determination of the covalent                      
              structure of biochemically interesting complex carbohydrates                   
              by physical methods including NMR spectroscopy, high                           
              performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.                       
              Several specific experiments are proposed in the structure of                  
              oligosaccharides from mucin glycoproteins and also in complex                  
              bacterial polysaccharides.  The prospect of using NMR                          
              spectroscopy of intact glycoproteins for exploring and                         
              screening carbohydrate structure in mucins will be evaluated.                  
              1H NMR and heteronuclear 1H detected 13C NMR spectroscopy will be              
              used.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The complete covalent structure of the capsular polysaccharide                 
              of a pathogenic strain of Vibrio vulnificus will be determined.                
              The complete 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the Re-LPS (lipid A) from               
              E. coli will be assigned and the anomeric configuration of the                 
              ketodeoxy octanoic acid (KDO) residues will be determined.                     
              Prospects for use of heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy for                        
              structure determination of lipopolysaccharides and exploration                 
              of the conformation will be evaluated.  The circular dichroism                 
              method for determination of the absolute configuration of the                  
              sugar residues of complex carbohydrates will be extended to new                
              types of monosaccharide residues and chromophoric                              
              polysaccharides.  The use of 13C-enriched bacterial                            
              polysaccharides for heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy, especially                 
              3-dimensional NMR methods will be explored.
