Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will defray part of the publication costs for the                 
              Proceedings of a Symposium on Myelin held in Columbia, Missouri                
              in October 1990.  Myelin provides an insulating sheath around                  
              nerve fibers and its integrity is essential for proper nerve                   
              function.  Participants in the Symposium discussed aspects of                  
              myelin development and regeneration.  Publication of the                       
              Proceedings of the meeting will provide neuroscientists worldwide              
              with an up-to-date appraisal of the research being done on this                
              important constituent of the nervous system.
