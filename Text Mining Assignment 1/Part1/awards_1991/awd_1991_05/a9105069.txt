Abstract    :
                This research is to apply several recently developed methods                 
              utilizing single-link cluster analysis to evaluate temporal and                
              spatial changes in mainshock and aftershock activity in eight                  
              different regional catalogs of earthquake hypocenters.  The                    
              catalogs are from networks in the Central Aleutians (Adak), Eastern            
              Alaska, California, Nicaragua, Oregon, the southern Soviet Union,              
              Peru, and Vanuatu.  The goal is to see how statistical properties              
              of earthquake clusters are influenced by the obvious stress and                
              rheologic differences between convergent margins, strike-slip                  
              margins, and volcanic regions.  This research is a component of the            
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
