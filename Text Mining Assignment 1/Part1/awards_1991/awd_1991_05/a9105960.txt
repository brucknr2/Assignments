Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Five undergraduate students will be selected to participate               
              in the Convection and Precipitation/Electrification Experiment                 
              (CaPE), being conducted in east central Florida (8 July - 18 Aug               
              1991).  The students will assist various scientists in ways                    
              designed to promote their interest in science as intended under                
              the REU program.
