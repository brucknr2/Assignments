Abstract    :
              In this project the PI will collect and analyse water samples for              
              Helium-3 concentration on WOCE (World Ocean Circulation                        
              Experiment) hydrographic lines in the Pacific.  The focus will be              
              on samples from the deep layers in order to study circulation                  
              related to hydrothermal venting along active sections of the mid-              
              ocean ridge system such as the East Pacific Rise and the Juan de               
              Fuca Ridge.  In combination with other WOCE tracer measurments, a              
              more complete description of the circulation of the deep Pacific               
              Ocean is expected.
