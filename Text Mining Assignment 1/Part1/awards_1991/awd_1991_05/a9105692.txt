Abstract    :
                   The development of large batholiths associated with subduction            
              tectonics is of considerable interest in crustal genesis.  Prior               
              work in the Sierra Nevada has indicated that the present erosion               
              surface cuts obliquely through a 30 kilometer depth section, thus              
              offering an opportunity to develop a model of both shallow and deep            
              portions of the same batholith-dominated crust.  The work involves             
              structural, petrographic and geochronological studies aimed at                 
              understanding the development of the batholith as of approximately             
              100 million years ago.  Results will refine understanding of                   
              subduction-related plutonism in California, which should also apply            
              to general models of batholith development.
