Abstract    :
                  Cores and outcrop sections of Late Triassic, cycle platform                
              carbonates in Hungary will be studied to determine why some cycles             
              record a transgressive (Lofer-type) succession, whereas other                  
              cycles record a regressive succession of facies.  Fischer plots                
              will be used to define relative, long-term (3rd order) sea level               
              curves, which will be compared to published Late Triassic curves.              
              Cyclic sections will be examined using spectral analysis to define             
              if any dominant periodicities occur, and if so, what were likely               
              causes.  Computer modeling will simulate facies successions, cycle             
              stacking patterns, possible subsidence rates, likely amplitude and             
              periods of 3rd to 5th order sea level fluctuations, possible ranges            
              of sedimentation rates, and likely emergence times of cycles during            
              sea level lowstands.  The diagenesis of the succession will be                 
              studied to determine the relationship, if any, of high and low                 
              frequency sea level fluctuations to the diagenetic record preserved            
              the rocks, and the relationship of the numerous cycle-capping                  
              disconformities, and Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic unconformities.                
              The work will define how faithfully a shallow carbonate platform's             
              sedimentary diagenetic record records its sea level and tectonic               
              history.
