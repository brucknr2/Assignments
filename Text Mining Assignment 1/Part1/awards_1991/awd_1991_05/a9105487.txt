Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this proposed research is to elucidate the            
              intermediate steps in the initiation of protein synthesis in                   
              eukaryotic cells.  The major objectives are to elucidate the                   
              mechanism of action of the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation             
              factors (eIF)-3, 4F, 4A, and 4B in the binding of mRNA to the                  
              ribosomes and to identify primary, secondary or tertiary structures            
              in the mRNA that affect the interaction of the mRNA with these                 
              factors and determine the efficiency with which the mRNA is                    
              translated.  The specific aims are:  1) to make specific changes               
              in the 5' ends of mRNAs and determine what effect(s) these changes             
              have on the amounts of eIF-3, 4F, 4A, and 4B required to initiate              
              translation; 2) to identify those structures in the mRNA that                  
              determine whether initiation of translation is dependent on a M7G              
              cap structure at the 5' end of the mRNA; 3) to identify the                    
              recognition and/or binding sites for eIF-3, 4F, 4A, and 4B on the              
              mRNA; 4) to determine when the initiation process eIF-4F, 4A, and              
              4B are released from the mRNA; 5) to identify the factors required             
              to initiate translation of uncapped mRNAs, such as poliovirus mRNA,            
              at an internal AUG initiation codon; and 6) to determine whether               
              eIF-4B or the cap binding subunits of eIF-4F or (iso)4F are                    
              phosphorylated and if so, what effect phosphorylation has on the               
              activities of these factors.  These studies will be carried out in             
              the wheat germ system with highly purified preparations of eIF-3,              
              4A, 4B, 4C, 4F and (iso)4F and with unmodified and modified form               
              of several mRNAs.  The mRNAs will be prepared by in vitro                      
              transcription of plasmids containing the cDNAs for .- and -globin             
              mRNA, satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) RNA, alfalfa mosaic              
              virus (AMV) RNA 4, barley .-amylase mRNA, poliovirus RNA (Lansing              
              strain, truncated), and Kozak hp7 CAT mRNA. Primer extension and               
              nuclease and/or chemical protection analysis will be used to                   
              identify the binding sites for eIF-4F, 4A and 4B or mRNA and                   
              antibodies will be used to determine when the factors are released             
              from the mRNA.  The results of this investigation will provide                 
              additional information will regard to intermediate steps in the                
              initiation of protein synthesis in plants as well as other                     
              eukaryotic cells.  The results obtained will provide additional                
              insights into the regulation of gene expression at the level of                
              translation.
