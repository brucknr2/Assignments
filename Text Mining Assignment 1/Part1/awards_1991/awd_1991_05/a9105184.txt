Abstract    :
                   Mary Ellen Rudin has exercised enormous influence on the field            
              of set-theoretic topology, especially since the publication of her             
              lectures on the subject at a regional conference of the American               
              Mathematical Society in 1972.  The occasion of her retirement -                
              merely from teaching, not from research or the communication of                
              knowledge - provides an opportunity to reflect on where the field              
              has been, where it is, and where it should be going.  The mechanism            
              proposed is a conference at which many of the invited speakers will            
              discuss precisely these questions for the subfields in which Rudin             
              has been significantly involved.  These comprise a large fraction              
              of the entire field of general topology.  Rudin's 1972 lectures set            
              the agenda for set-theoretic topology for more than 10 years;  this            
              conference, dedicated to Mary Ellen Rudin and her work, to be held             
              at the University of Wisconsin in June, 1991, should have a                    
              similarly stimulating effect.
