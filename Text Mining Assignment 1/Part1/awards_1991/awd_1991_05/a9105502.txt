Abstract    :
              An experiment which uses the methodology gained from VLBI to try               
              to improve determinations of the vertical from GPS will conducted.             
              The experiment involves establishing a network of homogeneous GPS              
              sites, with each GPS receiver being located at one of the VLBI                 
              sites participating in the low-elevation-angle VLBI "R&D"                      
              experiments.  These experiments, and their predecessors, have been             
              extremely useful in developing methods for improving the accuracy              
              of vertical estimates from VLBI.  By analyzing and comparing                   
              estimates obtained from both the GPS and the VLBI data sets,                   
              methods for obtaining the most accurate determinations of the                  
              vertical from GPS will be developed.
