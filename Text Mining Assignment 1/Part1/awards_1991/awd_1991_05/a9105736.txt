Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Knee will apply picosecond                          
              pump-probe photoelectron spectroscopy to the measurement of                    
              vibrational energy redistribution in polyatomic systems,                       
              including vibrational predissociation in van der Waals                         
              molecules.  The main technique to be used, zero energy                         
              photoelectron spectroscopy, is an ideal method for doing many                  
              different kinds of studies.  Also included in this work are                    
              experiments on ion vibrational spectroscopy.

              Studies of the dynamics which occurs during the course of                      
              simple chemical reactions are important in order to be able to                 
              understand the fundamental processes of chemical change and                    
              energy redistribution which are involved.  In particular,                      
              experiments on vibrational excitation of weakly bound species,                 
              such as van der Waals molecules, allow studies to be made at                   
              low energies, where vibrational modes are uncoupled and well                   
              understood.
