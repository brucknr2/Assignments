Abstract    :
                This research is to study seismic surface wave propagation in                
              the Pacific Ocean Basin.  First, surface-wave dispersion will be               
              investigated over a number of "aseismic" ridges and plateaus,                  
              including the Nazca, Cocos and Hawaiian Ridges; the goal will be               
              to obtain precise mapping of the crust-mantle interface, as well               
              as of the extent of the low-velocity zone under the chains.  This              
              will put substantial constraints on the thermo-mechanical                      
              interaction between the moving oceanic plate and the fixed plume               
              during the formation of the island, and, in the case of the                    
              Hawaiian chain, on the process of "healing" of the plate downstream            
              from the hotspot.  The second investigation will be of upper mantle            
              anisotropy, in particular with the goal of determining whether the             
              anisotropy required in the seismic asthenosphere by recent surface             
              wave observations is of the polarization or azimuthal type.  This              
              bears directly on the composition and crystalline layout of the                
              asthenosphere and on the processes of accretion upon cooling at the            
              base of the seismic lithosphere.
