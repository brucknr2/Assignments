Abstract    :
                   Photoionization cross sections and photoelectric angular                  
              distribution asymmetry parameters will be calculated for                       
              excited states of atoms and ions over a broad range of hv, n, 1,               
              nuclear charge and stage of ionization, employing Hartree Slater               
              wave functions.  Oscillator strengths and discrete to discrete                 
              transitions will also be studied.  The investigation will focus                
              on understanding the systematics of variation of the Cross                     
              sections and angular distributions over the periodic system.                   
              Hartree Fock calculations will be done for any of                              
              these transactions, as may be warranted, for greater accuracy.                 
              Isoelectronic sequences will be investigated to study the                      
              gradual change in behavior towards hydrogenic.  Changes in                     
              photoionization pattern over isonuclear and iso-ionic                          
              sequences will also be looked into.                                            
                   To fully understand the interaction of photons with                       
              matter, radiative recombination cross sections.  Consequently                  
              every system investigated for photoionization will also be                     
              investigated for radiative recombination.                                      
                   The method at present employed is a little restrictive in                 
              the sense that a study of the very highly excited states                       
              becomes impossible due to a numerical problem of convergence,  To              
              overcome this computational limitation, an attempt will be made                
              at formulating a new methodology based on the quantum                          
              defect theory.
