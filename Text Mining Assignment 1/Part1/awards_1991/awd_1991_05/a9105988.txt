Abstract    :
              This project is a cooperative effort between University of                     
              New Mexico (Dr. T.T. Ng) and Rennselaer Polytechnic                            
              Institute (Dr. Dobry) in which the objective is to use two-                    
               and three- dimensional random arrays of elastic rough                         
              quart ellipsoids for computer simulations of uniform sands.                    
              Good quantitative predictions for a wide range of strains,                     
              drained and undrained loading, and static as well as cyclic                    
              loading can be studied from these arrays. Micromechanical                      
              statistics of phenomena occurring at the particle/contact                      
              level will be obtained from the numerical simulations.                         
              Monotonic and cyclic laboratory axial/torsional tests on                       
              hollow cylindrical specimens of spherical and elongated                        
              glass beads as well as on sand will be done to verify                          
              numerical simulations.
