Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of                    
              equipment for the Paleomagnetics Laboratory at the Michigan                    
              Technological University. The University is committed to providing             
              matching funds for the purchase of the equipment, which includes               
              a spinner magnetometer, alternating field demagnetizer, and Curie              
              balance. It will be installed in the Department of Geological                  
              Engineering, Geology and Geophysics, and will be used by members               
              of the Department in research projects to determine the geologic               
              history of magnetic pole wandering and the effect of low-                      
              temperature oxidation on the magnetization of rocks.
