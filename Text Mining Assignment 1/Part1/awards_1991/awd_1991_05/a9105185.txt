Abstract    :
                   The uniformization theorem of one complex variable completely             
              classifies the one dimensional simply connected complex manifolds.             
              There is no corresponding result for higher dimensional complex                
              manifolds and it is important to try to find some method which will            
              provide a substitute classification. The principal investigator                
              will try to classify those higher dimensional complex manifolds                
              which satisfy a pinched curvature condition.                                   
                   Classification of a set of objects which satisfy a common                 
              property or condition is one tool mathematicians use to understand             
              structures and their relationships. If one can list all objects                
              which have a restricted common property, then one better                       
              understands the property and the objects. The principal                        
              investigator will attempt to do this with manifolds or surfaces                
              whose curvature falls between certain bounds.
