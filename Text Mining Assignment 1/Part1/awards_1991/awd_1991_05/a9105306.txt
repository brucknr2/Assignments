Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support for engineering                   
              development of a secondary ion resonant ionization mass                        
              spectrometer system at the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory               
              of Columbia University. The system being developed includes a                  
              pulsed-laser excited, two-photon, ionization step which should                 
              provide a significantly superior source of ions for mass                       
              spectrometry of rare elements like osmium. Improved sensitivity in             
              the analysis of osmium isotopes in geological samples would be a               
              significant advance because of the potential of the rhenium-187 to             
              osmium-187 decay system (half-life of 42 billion years) to unravel             
              problems of the chemical evolution of the crust and mantle and for             
              dating cosmochemical events.
