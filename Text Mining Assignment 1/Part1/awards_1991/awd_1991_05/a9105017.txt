Abstract    :
              A collaboration between petrologists and geochemists of the                    
              Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, D.C., and the                  
              Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Novosibirsk USSR, will be                 
              organized to carry out chemical and isotopic research on                       
              xenoliths of mantle rocks erupted in Siberian kimberlites.                     
              Soviet scientists will participate in the research performed in                
              Washington in visits ranging from 2 to 8 weeks.  Development of                
              models for the origin of continental cratons with their massive                
              mantle roots has been based in considerable part on                            
              investigations of xenoliths from southern Africa.  Further                     
              progress requires comparative study.  The Siberian craton is best              
              suited because xenoliths are abundant and because extensive                    
              collections and basic research have been carried out by Soviet                 
              investigators.  Attention will be focused on low-temperature,                  
              craton-forming peridotites and on megacrystalline dunites that                 
              sometimes contain diamonds.  Bulk analyses will permit comparison              
              of the Karpvaal and Siberian cratons.  Analyses for Os, Sr, Nd                 
              and Pb will be virtually the first performed on SIberian mantle                
              rocks and may provide records of craton evolution that have been               
              obscured in African xenoliths by post-Archaean metasomatism.                   
              Insights to the timing and nature of diamond-forming processes                 
              and to the location and distribution of Re and Os in mantle                    
              minerals will be sought.
