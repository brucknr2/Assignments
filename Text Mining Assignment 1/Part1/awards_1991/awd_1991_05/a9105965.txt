Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on transport of toxic                     
              contaminants in flowing, natural waters involving exchange                     
              processes between the stream-flow and the stream sediments                     
              which act as storage locations for the contaminants.  The                      
              research involves investigation of the fundamentals of                         
              stream-bed exchange using adsorbing inorganic contaminants                     
              and utilizing a five-meter long recirculating laboratory                       
              flume with a fine sand bed.  Adsorbing inorganic tracers                       
              planned for use include bivalent calcium and trivalent                         
              aluminum and chromium cations.  The investigators plan on                      
              using the adsorbable cationic dye tracer methylene blue to                     
              establish equilibrium and kinetic behavior of organic                          
              contaminants in batch-scale work before proceeding to                          
              flume experiments.  This project is being jointly                              
              supported by the Fluid, Particulate and Hydraulic Systems                      
              Program and the Environmental Engineering element of the                       
              Environmental and Ocean Systems Program.                                       
                                                                                             
              The relationship of bed-contribution of water pollutants                       
              from contaminated sediments to water quality with which                        
              those sediments are placed into contact by physical                            
              processes influencing the relative motion between                              
              sediments and particles disturbed by fluid motion are not                      
              well understood.  It is expected that results of this                          
              research will contribute toward formulation of better                          
              models than now exist of interactions between water in                         
              motion and sediments contaminated with organic and                             
              inorganic pollutants that contaminate the water, and                           
              application of those models in environmental and hydraulic                     
              engineering practice.
