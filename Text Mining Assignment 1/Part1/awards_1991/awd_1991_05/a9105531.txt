Abstract    :
                This research will study the three-dimensional anelastic                     
              structure of the earth's mantle.  Over three decades, the state of             
              knowledge has progressed from identifying qualitative variations               
              in seismic wave attenuation across tectonic features to models of              
              upper mantle anelasticity from surface wave amplitudes.  The                   
              incorporation of body wave amplitudes here will extend sensitivity             
              into the lower mantle while the current abundance of, and efficient            
              access to, seismic data from IRIS increases the feasibility of                 
              near-global inversions for anelastic structure in the entire                   
              mantle.  The results will provide insights into mantle dynamics and            
              composition.
