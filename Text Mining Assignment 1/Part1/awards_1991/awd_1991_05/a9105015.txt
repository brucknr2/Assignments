Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study the molecular mechanisms                
              of sorption reactions of selected cations at solid-water                       
              interfaces. They will attempt to understand the characteristics                
              of sorption complexes and the factors which determine those                    
              characteristics. The resulting information will be essential for               
              understanding aqueous sorption processes in general, and for                   
              developing meaningful predictive models that can accurately                    
              describe the transport of metal species, including toxic and                   
              radioactive elements, in groundwater systems.
