Abstract    :
                   This award provides approximately one-third of the funds                  
              required to upgrade the X-ray analysis and computer automation                 
              systems attached to the electron microprobe installed at the                   
              Institute for Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico. The                 
              remaining costs of the upgrade will be equally shared by the                   
              University and an award from NASA's program for Planetary Materials            
              and Geochemistry.                                                              
                   The upgraded electron microprobe laboratory will be open to               
              researchers at the University of New Mexico. The enhanced                      
              microanalytical capabilities of the probe are needed for a variety             
              of projects including the analysis of meteorite materials, drill               
              core samples returned from the Katmai, Alaska and Long Valley,                 
              California scientific drilling projects, studies of iron formations            
              in Brazil, and research in experimental petrology.
