Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Solid State Sciences Committee (SSSC) continues to                    
              identify and examine issues affecting the health of the field of               
              materials science in the United States.  Over the past three                   
              years several SSSC activities have resulted in reports on                      
              specific topics.  SSSC assessed the field of photonics and                     
              completed a major study of materials science and engineering.                  
              The SSSC is nearing completion of a study on diluted magnetic                  
              semiconductors.  The committee continues periodically to hold a                
              forum designed to bring together researchers and Washington                    
              policy makers.  Much of the committee's efforts over the past                  
              year have focused on following up the materials study and                      
              identifying new areas for future attention.                                    
                   The SSSC will continue to respond to the demands of the                   
              field by completing present projects and beginning new projects                
              with similar relevance to the health of materials science and the              
              solid state sciences.  Materials have been identified by the                   
              current administration, through OSTP, as an area for a national                
              science and technology initiative for the country.  SSSC will                  
              continue to support the development of this initiative.
