Abstract    :
                   This award provides 42% of the funding required to upgrade the            
              computer system in the Department of Geological Sciences at                    
              Northwestern University. The University is committed to providing              
              the remaining 58% funding required.                                            
                   The computer system will be used in a variety of projects                 
              including computing intensive research in seismology, modeling of              
              global plate tectonics, tsunamis, paleomagnetism, subduction zone              
              processes, and deep earth structure.
