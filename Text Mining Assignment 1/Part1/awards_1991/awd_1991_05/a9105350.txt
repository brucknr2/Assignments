Abstract    :
                   It is possible to analyze fossil shelled cephalopods in terms             
              of external shell morphology and hydromechanical characteristics,              
              using microcomputer simulations and principal components analysis.             
              This approach will be combined with indexing of internal sutural               
              form, in order to (a) document the morphological history of Upper              
              Carboniferous ammonoids in terms of whole-shell and hydromechanical            
              characteristics; (b) determine whether there is a functional basis             
              to existing phylogenetic-based systematic schemes for Carboniferous            
              ammonoids; (c) attempt to determine the extent to which sutural                
              form influences ammonoid hydrostatics, and to track changes in                 
              sutural complexity against shell form and hydrostatics through                 
              time, in an effort to evaluate the functional role of the suture               
              and (d) relate the evolutionary history and diversity of                       
              morphological and hydromechanical characteristics of Upper                     
              Carboniferous ammonoids to existing models of paleoecology and sea-            
              level curves for this interval.
