Abstract    :
              The plasticity of the plant genome permits the tissue to change                
              from one form of development to another.  Once the developmental               
              fate is determined, a series of morphological changes result that              
              are accompanied by sequential changes in gene expression.  The                 
              mechanism of the developmental switch is poorly understood,                    
              except that major genomic reprogramming might occur.  Recently,                
              the PI found that late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) genes are                  
              activated at the onset of embryogeny from the zygote, from                     
              cultured microspores and from cultured leaf tissue.  This result               
              suggests that the embryonic switch involves a global derepression              
              or activation of a battery of genes including both early and late              
              embryonic genes.  To substantiate this hypothesis, the PI                      
              proposes to study the mechanisms of gene expression at the onset               
              of embryogenesis.  Experiments are designed to compare the                     
              mechanisms by which a LEA gene, DC8, is expressed at early and                 
              late embryogeny, and to identify the genes involved in the                     
              activation of the DC8 promotor.
