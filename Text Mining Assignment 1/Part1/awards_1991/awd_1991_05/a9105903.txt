Abstract    :
                   The distribution of warm-climate flora and fauna to high                  
              paleolatitudes during times of global warming (Cretaceous through              
              Eocene) is a prime criterion arguing for a decreased range in                  
              seasonal temperature variation for the interiors of large                      
              continents.  Such interpretations, however, are in conflict with               
              predictions based on Energy Balance and General Circulation Climate            
              Models.  According to modeling studies, in contrast to warm and                
              equable oceanic and coastal environments during periods of high                
              latitude warming of the ocean, continental interiors should retain             
              a wide range of seasonal temperature variation.  As a test of this             
              hypothesis, this study will provide quantitative measures of                   
              minimum seasonal temperature variation present within the                      
              continental interior of North America utilizing del 18O variation              
              in fossil marine and non-marine bivalves.  Advances in sampling                
              techniques now permit microanalysis of the accretionary growth                 
              structure present in bivalves, with a time resolution of weekly to             
              submonthly intervals.  Evaluation of these data from sequential                
              stratigraphic levels will constrain temporal changes in seasonality            
              and mean annual temperature in the interior of North America from              
              late Cretaceous to late Eocene times.
