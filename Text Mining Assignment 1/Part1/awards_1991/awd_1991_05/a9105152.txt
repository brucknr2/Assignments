Abstract    :
                This research is to utilize the Saint Louis University                       
              seismometer network to study heterogeneities in the New Madrid                 
              intraplate earthquake zone.  A new series expansion method will be             
              use to develop path Green's functions on source locations from                 
              small, less than magnitude 2.5, earthquakes.  Then, the Green's                
              function method will be applied to larger earthquakes in the New               
              Madrid region to study spatial/temporal variations in rupture                  
              properties.  A second investigation will utilize the S-wave coda               
              to map three-dimensional Q structure in the New Madrid seismic                 
              zone.  These studies should provide insights on the nature of                  
              heterogeneities within and near the source zone of New Madrid                  
              earthquakes.  This is important both for knowledge of earthquake               
              processes in intraplate regions and for assessing earthquake                   
              hazard.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake               
              Hazard Reduction Program.
