Abstract    :
                   Partial or complete travel support is provided to permit                  
              graduate students, and some speakers, to attend a cross-                       
              discipline workshop on Plasma Experiments in Laboratory and                    
              Space, to be held in Alpbach, Austria July 1-6, 1991.  The                     
              conference will emphasize areas of plasma physics of common                    
              interest to laboratory and space science, including such topics                
              as:  critical velocity, reconnection, ion cyclotron waves, beam                
              driven instabilities, anomalous resistivity, double layers,                    
              collisionless shocks, non-linear and kinetic Alven waves, active               
              space experiments, turbulence, and transport.
