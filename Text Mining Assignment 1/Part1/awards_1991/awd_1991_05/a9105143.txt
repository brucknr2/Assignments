Abstract    :
              Most bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, and higher plants use                     
              inorganic sulfate as their sole sulfur source for the biosynthesis             
              of cysteine, methionine, all reduced organic sulfur-containing                 
              coenzymes (biotin, thiamin, coenzyme A, lipoate, etc.), and a                  
              variety of structural components (plant sulfolipid, sulfated                   
              polysaccharides, etc.).  The overall objective of the research is              
              to establish the catalytic mechanism, regulatory properties, and               
              structure-function relationships of the enzymes which catalyze the             
              earliest steps of inorganic sulfate assimilation by fungi.  Thus,              
              a study of the enzymes (a) ATP sulfurylase, (b) APS kinase, and                
              (c)   "PAPS reductase"  which catalzye, in order, (a) the formation            
              of adenosine-5'- phosphosulfate (APS) from SO42- and ATP, (b) the              
               formation of 3'-phosphoadenosine- 5'- phosphosulfate (PAPS) from              
              APS and ATP, and (c) the NADPH and thioredoxin-dependent reduction             
              of PAPS to free or bound sulfite.  "PAPS reductase" is actually a              
              multicomponent system which has never been purified to homogeneity             
              of kinetically characterized.  Most of the experiments will be                 
              performed with enzymes purified from the mesophilic fungus,                    
              Penicillium chrysogenum.  Parallel studies will be performed on the            
              enzymes from the thermophile, Penicillium duponti with the                     
              objective of identifying the structural features responsible for               
              the remarkable heat stability of proteins from this organism.                  
              Enzyme kinetics, equilibrium binding, protein chemistry, and                   
              molecular biology methods will be used.
