Abstract    :
                   This is the tenth in a series of Gordon Conferences on                    
              Atomic Physics.  It will be held July 1-5, 1991 at Brewster                    
              Academy, Wolfboro, New Hampshire.  The meeting emphasizes                      
              emerging areas and major advances in existing areas of atomic                  
              physics, in both theory and experiment.  Conference organizers                 
              emphasize the participation of young, highly promising graduate                
              students and postdoctoral scientists, along with mature                        
              scientists, in an environment which is conducive to spontaneous                
              discussion and informal exchange of ideas.
