Abstract    :
              Recently, the propagation of dark spatial solitons in                          
              a variety of different material systems has been                               
              observed by the PI.  These systems include sodium                              
              vapor, various thermal liquids, and the bulk                                   
              semiconductors ZnSe and GaAs.  The work described                              
              in this proposal will consist of experimental,                                 
              theoretical, and numerical efforts, and represents a                           
              comprehensive program designed to understand the                               
              fundamental nature of the propagation of dark spatial                          
              soliton eigenmodes in general self-defocusing                                  
              nonlinear optical media.  We will investigate in detail                        
              the collision and stability properties of these solitons                       
              when they are subjected to experimental                                        
              perturbations.  Such perturbations may include loss                            
              (both linear and nonlinear absorption), deviation                              
              from the simple Kerr-law dependence of the real part                           
              of the refractive index, and instabilities induced by                          
              the difference in dimensionality between the                                   
              experimental situation and the one typically assumed                           
              for theoretical treatments of the problem.  In                                 
              addition to the experiments to be performed in bulk                            
              nonlinear optical media, a series of experiments                               
              designed to investigate the propagation characteristics                        
              of dark surface waves will be performed.  Dark                                 
              surface waves are a new kind of wave discovered by                             
              the PI which are closely related to dark spatial                               
              solitons and are expected to have application in the                           
              area of nonlinear integrated optics.
