Abstract    :
                   Professor Yu will work in two areas of graph theory.  He                  
              will study contractible edges and their applications, as well as               
              cycles, cycle covers, and cycle decompositions.                                
                   Graph Theory began more than two hundred years ago with the               
              work of L. Euler, but it is only in the last half-century that                 
              the field has flourished.  It is now one of the most active,                   
              fertile branches of mathematics.  A graph is a network of lines                
              ("edges") joining points ("vertices"), so that graph theory                    
              becomes a natural tool for studying interrelationships among                   
              separated entities.  Graph Theory is used not only in                          
              Communications Theory but in surprisingly many parts of pure and               
              applied mathematics, as well as in Theoretical Computer Science.
