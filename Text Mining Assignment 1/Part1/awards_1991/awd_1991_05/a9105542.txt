Abstract    :
              Through the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee, the U.S.             
              Geological Survey has developed and is managing several Arctic data            
              activities.  The Arctic Environmental Data Directory (AEDD) is an              
              on-line searchable data base containing descriptions and locations             
              of major U.S. and selective international data sets.  It is being              
              added to as new or additional data are located.  The Arctic Data               
              Interactive (ADI) is a self contained CD-ROM (computer disk-read               
              only memory) which contains representative scientific arctic                   
              information, select bibliographies, and the AEDD.                              
              The IARPC agencies agreed to collectively support these activities             
              over the next two years.  This interagency transfer of funds                   
              partially fulfills requirements of the Arctic Research and Policy              
              Act of 1984 to promote the dissemination of arctic data and                    
              information.
