Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project aims to develop quantitative understanding of the                 
              basis for regulation of glycogenolysis, a process most certainly               
              carried out by multi-enzyme complexes in muscle.  Specific aims                
              will be to develop useful models of complexes with increasing                  
              degrees of organization, along with mathematical expressions of                
              their activities, so that predictions can be tested experimentally.            
              Models will be evaluated in terms of actual enzyme sensitivity to              
              effectors, response times with changes in effector levels, energy              
              consumption, and relationship to native glycogen particles.                    
              Microscopy of the scanning tunneling and atomic force type(s) will             
              be employed to visualize system components and the complexes likely            
              to occur with them.//
