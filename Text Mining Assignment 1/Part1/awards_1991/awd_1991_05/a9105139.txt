Abstract    :
                   This award will provide two-thirds of the funding needed to               
              acquire a high-speed graphics workstation to be installed in the               
              Department of Geological Sciences at the State University of New               
              York at Binghamton. SUNY-Binghamton is committed to providing the              
              remaining funds necessary to acquire the equipment.                            
                   The graphics workstation is needed to provide graphics                    
              capability and data storage capacity for a number of seismological             
              studies involving seismogram synthesis and inverse theory in                   
              waveform modeling of body and surface waves for earthquake and                 
              explosion sources and crustal structure determinations.
