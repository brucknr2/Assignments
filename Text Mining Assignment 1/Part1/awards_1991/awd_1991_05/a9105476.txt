Abstract    :
              This award supports an investigation of the climate of the                     
              Precambrian era (600 million to 4 billion years ago).  This                    
              investigation of climate has two major efforts:  1.  Clarify the               
              long standing paradox of the faint young sun and the climate                   
              evolution of the earth's atmosphere, and 2.  Examine current                   
              climate theory in light of the great changes in parameters of the              
              Precambrian.  The geologic and planetary records have definite                 
              evidence for four earth parameter changes of consequence for                   
              Precambrian climate:  a smaller solar luminosity , a faster Earth              
              rotation rate, a different atmospheric composition and a much                  
              reduced land area.  Because of the critical importance of the                  
              hydrologic cycle and eddy properties found in previous studies,                
              this study will use GCM modeling with the NCAR Community Climate               
              Model.  Profound changes in the general circulation found in the               
              Precambrian offer a fundamental way to study current climate                   
              balances and the current climate state of the Earth.
