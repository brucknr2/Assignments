Abstract    :
                This research is to conduct two refraction/wide-angle reflection             
              profiles along the axes of the Appalachian gravity high and gravity            
              low in north Georgia using timed quarry blasts and a portable 20-              
              element array of three-component seismometers.  The principal goal             
              of this experiment will be to trace changes in crustal velocity                
              structure and depth to Moho across the transition from accreted                
              crust beneath the Carolina Slate Belt to North American craton                 
              beneath the Blue Ridge.  The main profiles and more localized                  
              soundings will provide images of lower crust and Moho that                     
              supplement existing normal incidence profiles.  They will also                 
              provide improved estimates of P and S wave velocities that will                
              place constraints on the composition and metamorphic grade of lower            
              crustal rocks and the detailed structure of the crust-mantle                   
              transition.
