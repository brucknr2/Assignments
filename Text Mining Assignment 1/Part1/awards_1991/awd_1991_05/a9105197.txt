Abstract    :
              Robust control has become the central focus of control                         
              systems research over the last 12 years.  The objective                        
              of this project is to bring together leading international                     
              control researchers to assess the state of knowledge in                        
              the rapidly advancing field of robust control.  In                             
              particular, several independent conceptual and                                 
              mathematical approaches have developed over the                                
              years.  These are H-infinity optimal control, parametric                       
              robust stability based on Kharitonov's theorem and                             
              related topics, l1 optimal control, mu-analysis, and                           
              quantitative feedback theory.  This workshop will being                        
              together experts from each of these areas, for the first                       
              time.  This will produce a cross fertilization of ideas                        
              and lead to more effective approaches toward                                   
              developing solutions to the robust control problem.                            
              Some plenary talks and a concluding panel discussion                           
              are planned with this in mind.  The papers presented at                        
              the workshop will be published in book form.  The                              
              results of the workshop will have a very significant                           
              international impact on research, education, and                               
              engineering applications of robust control for many                            
              years to come.
