Abstract    :
                   One of the basic concepts of Plate Tectonics is that                      
              continental plates are rigid, with deformation only along their                
              margins.  However, there are extensive areas within continental                
              crust that have undergone large magnitude distributed deformation              
              at a regional scale, notably in the southwestern United States.                
              This project will use a combination of field and laboratory                    
              techniques to evaluate the role of strike-slip faulting and block              
              rotation and measure the internal deformation of a portion of the              
              Basin and Range province, and to attempt to relate this deformation            
              to plate boundary processes.
