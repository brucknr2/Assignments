Abstract    :
                   The Pacific Northwest has been shown to consist of large                  
              blocks of exotic oceanic material accreted to the North American               
              craton.  Recent research in the northern Cordillera has indicated              
              that an ancient continental margin assemblage of possible North                
              American affinity occurs outboard of at least the northern part of             
              the Stikine terrane, one of the far-traveled terranes.  This                   
              project will investigate the extent of the out-of-place North                  
              American continental rocks along the outboard margin of the Stikine            
              terrane and to determine the structural or depositional                        
              relationships between them and the stikine terrane.  The work will             
              involve mapping, geochronology and isotopic studies.  Determining              
              these relationships is expected to have a major impact on the                  
              understanding of the tectonic evolution of juvenile terranes and               
              continental margin assemblages both in the northern Cordillera and             
              in other orogens that record rapid crustal growth by accretion of              
              allochthonous terranes.
