Abstract    :
                   The rivers flowing into the Black Sea from the territory of               
              the Soviet Union were sampled on a very successful expedition in               
              the Summer of 1990.  It is proposed to continue and develop this               
              collaboration with Soviet scientists by extending this work to the             
              rivers of the East.  Our Soviet colleagues have proposed that the              
              headwaters of the two affluents of the Aral Sea, Amu Darya and Syr             
              Darya, be sampled in the Spring of 1991, that work on the Upper                
              Lena begin in the Summer of 1991 and that the Lower Lena and                   
              Indigirka be studied in 1992.  These studies will provide valuable             
              information on the weathering yield from the rivers of the Soviet              
              Union thereby greatly strengthening the data base for global mass              
              balance studies.  The rivers of the East drain a unique unglaciated            
              sub-Arctic environment.  This will allow a comparative study of                
              weathering processes with the well known Tropical rivers of South              
              America which drain similar rock types.  This project will also                
              provide base line information on the region most likely to be first            
              impacted by any greenhouse warming.
