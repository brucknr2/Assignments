Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% partial funding for the acquisition               
              of a thermal ionization mass spectrometer to be installed and                  
              operated in the Department of Geology at the University of                     
              Maryland. The University is committed to providing the remaining               
              funds.                                                                         
                   The instrument is to be used primarily in the conduct of                  
              research on the chemical evolution of the  Earth's crust and mantle            
              and in investigations of the origin of noble metal ores. The                   
              isotopic systems to be analyzed by mass spectrometry include                   
              rhenium-osmium, samarium-neodymium, uranium-lead-thorium, rubidium-            
              strontium, lithium, and boron.
