Abstract    :
                   This award will provide for half the funding necessary to                 
              upgrade the high-resolution and analytical transmission electron               
              microscopy (HRTEM/AEM) laboratory at Johns Hopkins University.  The            
              university is committed to provide the additional funds needed for             
              this acquisition.  The present facility, which has been heavily                
              used, is nearly seven years old and clearly needs an upgrade.  The             
              components to be added, which include a new Si/Li X-ray detector,              
              a liquid nitrogen analytical specimen holder, a new computer, a new            
              TEM video system, and a new ion mill, will assure that this                    
              facility will continue to generate high quality data.  This                    
              laboratory is considered to be one of the two most productive in               
              the country.  This upgrade should make it possible to extend the               
              highly useful life of this facility for several years.
