Abstract    :
                This research is to expand a study of earthquake source                      
              parameters and the seismotectonics of major intraplate                         
              earthquakes in stable continental areas and apply the results to               
              implications of seismic hazard in the seismically active New                   
              Madrid area of the central U.S.  The seismicity of the central                 
              and eastern U.S. is a significant hazard.  Yet, due to lack of a               
              suitable conceptual framework, the origin of large earthquakes in              
              the stable interior of continents remain a challenging problem                 
              for earthquake seismology and tectonics.  One of the                           
              contributions of this study is to provide a consistent                         
              description  of intraplate earthquake parameters on which to base              
              earthquake hazard estimations.  This research is a component of                
              the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
