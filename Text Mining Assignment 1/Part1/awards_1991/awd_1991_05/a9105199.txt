Abstract    :
                   Strike-slip faulting has played a major role in the tectonic              
              evolution of the northern Cordillera, however the timing, location             
              and mechanisms of much of the strike-slip motion is not well                   
              established.  Prior work has identified major dextral slip of                  
              Cretaceous age along the Border Ranges Fault, Alaska.  Preliminary             
              evidence indicates that the present level of erosion exposes the               
              fault near the brittle-ductile transition at the time of motion.               
              Recent models have proposed major subhorizontal detachments in                 
              strike-slip systems at this transition, in addition to the steep,              
              strike-slip detachment normally envisioned.  Because of the deep               
              level of exposed crust and exceptional outcrop exposure this area              
              affords the opportunity to test these models of the role of                    
              subhorizontal detachments in strike-slip shear zones.  Results are             
              expected to be applicable to many large-scale strike-slip zones.
