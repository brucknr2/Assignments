Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in collaboration with Michael McCurry              
              (Idaho State University), will study the Organ Mountain Batholith              
              (south central New Mexico) using isotopic and petrologic                       
              techniques, with emphasis on establishing the vertical chemical and            
              isotopic zonations of this igneous body. The study is made special             
              by the ability to study the top of the magma chamber, a section                
              that is commonly not accessible in other such bodies. Through this             
              work geologists will gain important information about the processes            
              of magmatic differentiation that result in large-volume silicic                
              igneous rock bodies.
