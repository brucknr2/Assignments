Abstract    :
                   The Sixth Marcel Grossman Meeting on Recent Advances in                   
              General Relativity will be held in Kyoto, Japan, June 23-29,                   
              1991.  These meetings are devoted to reviewing recent advances                 
              in gravitational and general relativity with emphasis on their                 
              mathematical foundations and physical predictions.  This award                 
              will supply travel funds to support the participation of                       
              approximately twenty U.S. scientists in this international                     
              meeting.
