Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Marine elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) synthesize and                 
              retain high concentrations of urea in their tissues for the purpose            
              of osmoregulation.  Mammals also synthesize urea, but for the                  
              purpose of detoxifying nitrogen wastes for disposal in the urine               
              as urea.  The enzyme catalyzing the first step of urea biosynthesis            
              in liver of sharks is uniquely different from the corresponding                
              enzyme in mammalian species, and it is also present in a few non-              
              elasmobranch species of fish, which is interesting, since fish                 
              generally do not make urea - they excrete ammonia directly into the            
              water via their gills.  The product of this reaction step is also              
              utilized for biosynthesis of precursors needed for genetic                     
              expression, and the formation of this compound is catalyzed by a               
              different but related enzyme, which in sharks is also different                
              from the corresponding mammalian enzyme.  These differences are                
              related to  the absence of a compound needed by most tumor tissues             
              for nitrogen and energy, and the results may have a bearing on the             
              observation that sharks are resistant to cancer.  Elasmobranchs                
              also differ significantly form other species in how they store fat             
              for energy and how this is made available during fasting.  These               
              enzymes and processes will be investigated in this study and the               
              results will provide valuable comparative information about 1)                 
              these enzymes (the enzymes for shark appear to be evolutionary                 
              intermediates),  2) the evolution and function of the urea                     
              biosynthetic pathway, and 3)  the enzymatic regulation of energy               
              and of nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism in sharks and fish,                
              which may serve as useful model systems for studying these                     
              processes in humans or mammalian species in general.//
