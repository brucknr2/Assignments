Abstract    :
              Summitville is a classic example of the acid sulfate type of ore               
              deposit, but deep drilling shows that there are "porphyry-type"                
              vein stockworks and alteration at depth beneath.  The deep                     
              mineralization has not been carefully studied or dated.  This                  
              project is to describe in detail the veins and alteration of the               
              deep mineralization and to date them (K-Ar on sericite and                     
              alunite) and the shallow alunite associated with gold.  It should              
              be possible to establish the nature of the relationship of the                 
              "porphyry-type" mineralization to the shallow copper-gold and the              
              relation of both to other occurrences of enargite-covellite lodes              
              such as those in Butte, Montana.  Another aspect is numerical                  
              modeling of covellite-enargite-gold precipitation by the newly                 
              recognized process of boiling with decreasing pH.                              
              Magmatically-derived waters with admixed meteoric waters will be               
              used.  It is also planned to model processes of mixing and wall                
              rock reaction.  A clear understanding of the processes of ore                  
              precipitation and wall rock reaction in acid-sulfate-type                      
              epithermal ore deposits should be established.
