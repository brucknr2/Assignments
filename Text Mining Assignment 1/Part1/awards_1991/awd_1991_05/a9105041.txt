Abstract    :
                   Fan-shaped features (fans) in the southern Blue Ridge province            
              are essentially mantled pediments.  The mantles, ranging in                    
              thickness from 1 to 30 m, consist of diamictons (probably debris               
              flows) and alluvium, and commonly is separated from underlying                 
              metamorphic bedrock by a layer of saprolite.  Rather than the                  
              depositional mechanisms that have been the focus of previous                   
              studies of Blue Ridge fans, the thrust of this study is to                     
              understand these landforms in the light of previous research on                
              pediments in arid and semiarid regions.  Fans in five areas will               
              be mapped using aerial photographs and soil properties to delineate            
              terraces of different ages; standard soil-development indices will             
              be used to estimate ages of the terraces.  Seismic refraction and              
              reflection as well as drilling will be used to determine sediment              
              and saprolite thickness and subsurface relief on terraces of                   
              different ages.  In order to ascertain factors necessary for fan               
              formation, areas with fans will be compared with other areas in the            
              Blue Ridge lacking fans with respect to piedmont and basin                     
              morphometry, lithology, soils, and maximum clast size.  A                      
              hypothesis to be tested is that fans occur only where uplands occur            
              only where uplands supply great numbers of large boulders to the               
              mountain piedmont.
