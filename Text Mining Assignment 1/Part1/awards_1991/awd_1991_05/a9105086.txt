Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to contribute to the                         
              understanding of fundamental system-theoretic properties of                    
              manufacturing processes modeled as serial production lines in mass             
              production environment.  A particular class of processes addressed             
              is referred to as asymptotically reliable serial production lines.             
              Such lines consist of machines that have, in isolation, very good              
              performance characteristics.  Nevertheless, being placed in a                  
              production line, they may (and often do) operate much less                     
              efficiently.  Therefore, the main problem addressed in this project            
              is how to design a serial production line so that its performance              
              is as close to that of machines in isolation as possible.  A study             
              to develop formalized, analytical procedures for optimal buffer                
              capacity assignment, feedback control of row material dispatch, and            
              optimal quality control system design will be performed.                       
                   The approach of the study is based on an asymptotic analysis              
              of Markov chains that describe production systems under                        
              consideration.  Although simplified analysis of Markov processes               
              has been utilized in modern System and Control theory on a number              
              of occasions, the asymptotics employed in this work has not been               
              explored and exploited in the past.  It is expected that the                   
              results of this project will contribute to the science base of                 
              manufacturing systems modeled as serial production lines.
