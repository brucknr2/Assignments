Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Brown University will purchase                
              computer equipment consisting of workstations, networking                      
              hardware, and programming and symbolic algebra software which                  
              will be dedicated to support research in the mathematical                      
              sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research                     
              projects, including in particular: (1) the study of wave                       
              phenomena, the numerical computation of singular integrals                     
              related to free surface problems in non-linear fluid dynamics,                 
              the scattering frequency of linear waves, and the unstable                     
              solutions of nonlinear dispersive waves; (2) various problems in               
              number theory and arithmetic geometry, such as arithmetic                      
              properties of Weierstrass points, p-adic dynamical systems and                 
              the fields generated by the fixed points of such systems,                      
              canonical heights on elliptic curves over number fields, and the               
              Diophantine geometry of K3 surfaces; (3) boundary value problems               
              and eigenvalue problems for elliptic differential operators.
