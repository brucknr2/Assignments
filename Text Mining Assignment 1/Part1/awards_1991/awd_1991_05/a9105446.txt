Abstract    :
                   The PI will perform theoretical studies of the high pressure              
              properties of candidate mantle and core phases in order to better              
              constrain the chemistry and mineral composition of the mantle and              
              core.  Several important and basic questions will be addressed,                
              including: 1) phase transitions in SiO2 stishovite that would lead             
              to extreme shear elastic softening, 2) possible high temperature               
              phase transitions in MgSiO3, 3) bonding characteristics of iron in             
              search for new candidate high pressure-high temperature phases.
