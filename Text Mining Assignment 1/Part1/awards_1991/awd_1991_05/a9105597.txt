Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. So-Young Pi,                        
              Department of Physics, Boston University, to pursue with Dr.

              Korea, for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative                     
              research on gauge field theories in the Schrodinger picture.                   
              The Schrodinger picture method for obtaining information from                  
              quantum field theories will be further developed, and                          
              this method will be applied to gauge theories and to some                      
              (2+1)-dimensional models, particularly those involving                         
              Chern-Simons terms.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The success of quantum electrodynamics and the standard model                  
              for electro-weak and strong interactions shows that the quantum                
              field theory  is the most reliable framework for describing                    
              subatomic phenomena.  The Schrodinger picture formulation of                   
              this theory gives the best physical picture of the subatomic                   
              world but mathematical problems with it only recently have                     
              been understood.  The collaborators have used this approach                    
              successfully in prior research under NSF Grant No. INT-8807985.                
              They expect this research to produce discoveries and an                        
              understanding of the structure of various quantum field                        
              theories.  The PI and her collaborator are highly respected                    
              scientists in the field of the research and have a record of                   
              successful collaboration.  This project is relevant to the                     
              objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program                       
              which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between                       
              U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange                  
              of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and                   
              through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Dr. Yee's                
              participation in  the project is supported by the Korea                        
              Science and Engineering Foundation  (KOSEF).
