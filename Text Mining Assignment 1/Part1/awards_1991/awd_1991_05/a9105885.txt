Abstract    :
              Understanding the function of proteins requires knowledge of                   
              their structures, conformations, and internal motions.  While the              
              existence of motions in proteins on a broad time scale is                      
              generally acknowledged, computer simulations of those motions are              
              confined primarily to the subnanosecond regime.  Experimental                  
              quantification of both  the rates and amplitudes of molecular                  
              motions on this time scale is difficult, but necessary in order                
              to give credence to implications of the simulations.  The overall              
              goals of this project are to validate and to further develop NMR               
              and fluorescence methods for measuring internal motions in                     
              peptides and proteins, to apply those methods to specially                     
              synthesized, isotopically labeled peptides and genetically                     
              engineered proteins, and to correlate the experimental results                 
              with computer simulations of the molecular dynamics.  NMR and                  
              fluorescence data will be acquired on the same residues in the                 
              same peptides and proteins to confirm the experimental values for              
              the motional parameters.  The peptides examined will include the               
              cytolytic peptide melittin, which is especially suited for this                
              work because of the solvent-dependent nature of its conformation               
              and its propensity to interact with proteins and with lipids.                  
              The proteins to be investigated, RNAse-T1, thioredoxin, and                    
              barnase, are of low molecular weight and have known crystal                    
              and/or solution structures.
