Abstract    :
              Eukaryotic initiation factor 2, eIF, is an essential protein                   
              synthesis initiation factor that is subject to regulation by                   
              reversible phosphorylation.  As part of the cellular antiviral                 
              defense mechanism, an interferon-induced, dsRNA-dependent protein              
              kinase,eIF-2.-PKds, becomes activated on viral infection and                   
              phosphorylates the alpha subunit eIF-2.  This results in a                     
              limitation of functional eIF-2 available for protein synthesis with            
              a concomitant reduction of protein synthesis.  A number of animal              
              viruses, including vaccinia virus, have evolved mechanisms to                  
              inhibit the activation of eIF-2.-PKds in interferon-treated cells.             
              The ability of vaccinia virus to grow in interferon-treated cells              
              stems in part from the production of a vaccinia early gene product,            
              termed specific kinase inhibitory factor, SKIF, that prevents                  
              activation of eIF-2.-PKds.  In addition vaccinia virus encodes a               
              gene which has homology with the alpha subunit of eIF-2 and encodes            
              a 10 kDa protein.  Although the function of the eIF-2 alpha-like               
              gene is not known, an eIF-2 alpha-like peptide of approximately                
              10 kDa accumulates early in vaccinia virus infection.                          
              The first aim of this proposal is to monitor the effect of vaccinia            
              virus infection on the levels and activation state of elF-2.-PKds,             
              as well as the phosphorylation state of elF-2. in vaccinia virus               
              infected Hela cells.  The reagents necessary to do this, antibody              
              to elF-2.-PKds and elF-2. are available.  The second aim of ths                
              ptoposal is to investigate the function of pK2 and to determine                
              whether its product has elF-2.-like activity and whether it is                
              involved in the ability of vaccinia virus to grow in interferon-               
              treated cell.  The K2 gene has been cloned into the expression                 
              vector, pTM1, which will enable us to synthesize radiolabelled PK2             
              in vitro, as well to transfect the gene into mammalian cells.  The             
              gene will be transferred to a bacterial expression vector to allow             
              the production of milligram quantities of pK2 for biochemical                  
              analyses.  The properties of the vaccinia encoded elF-2.-like gene             
              product will be compared with those of cellular elF-2. with                    
              reference to its guanine nucleotide binding properties, its                    
              ability to enter preinitiation complexes, and its ability to                   
              function as a substrate for elF-2.-PKds.
