Abstract    :
                   The study proposed here is aimed at evaluating the importance             
              of subgrid-scale land-atmosphere interactions at different spatial             
              and temporal scales.  The Colorado State University Regional                   
              Atmospheric Modeling System (CSU-RAMS) will be used for this                   
              purpose.  The domain simulated by this state-of-the-art numerical              
              atmospheric model can vary from a few kilometers to a few thousand             
              of kilometers.  Thus, subgrid-scale processes in a single grid of              
              a GCM, for instance, can be investigated at the grid scale with                
              this model.  Funds are being provided to augment the project                   
              supported by Climate Dynamics (NSF) with an experienced post                   
              doctoral researcher plus supplies.
