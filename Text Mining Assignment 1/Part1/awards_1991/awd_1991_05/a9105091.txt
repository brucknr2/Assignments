Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to characterize the mechanism of                    
              retroviral integration.  Retroviruses efficiently and stably                   
              introduce foreign genes into the host genome.  Defining the pathway            
              and requirements for integration is significant both for the                   
              understanding of the viral life-cycle, but also as a means of                  
              introduction of DNA, in general, into mammalian cells.  Two known              
              viral components are needed for an integration event:  the IN                  
              protein and the inverted repeat sequences found at the termini of              
              the Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs).  Experiments are aimed at                    
              defining the functional domains of the Moloney-Murine Leukemia                 
              Virus (M-MuLV) IN protein.  A second objective is to define the                
              specific sequences recognized by the IN protein and possibly other             
              proteins with the LTR terminal inverted repeats.  A third objective            
              is to see if the virus could be directed to integrate into a known             
              site in the host DNA.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The information resulting from this work will give greater insight             
              into the molecular mechanisms utilized by viruses.  Such insights              
              will obviously affect the practical concerns in using viruses as               
              vectors.***
