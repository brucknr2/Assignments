Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the Johns Hopkins University                  
              will purchase computer equipment which will be dedicated to                    
              support research in the mathematical sciences.                                 
                                                                                             
              The equipment will be used for several research projects,                      
              including in particular:                                                       
                                                                                             
              (a) A time intensive computer search for new immersions of real                
              projective spaces coming from bilinear maps plus a package of                  
              programs to check conjectures in the area.                                     
                                                                                             
              (b) A continued attempt to transform unstable Brown-Peterson                   
              operations into a working tool for algebraic topologists.                      
                                                                                             
              (c) The ability to compute with representations of simple                      
              algebraic groups.                                                              
                                                                                             
              (d) The computation of syzygies.                                               
                                                                                             
              (e) The day to day problems that arise in algebraic topology,                  
              especially those related to the Steenrod algebra and Brown-                    
              Peterson cohomology, where computations by hand take far too long              
              and/or are too error prone.
