Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms of               
              regulation of heme-regulated eIF-2. kinase (HRI) at the molecular              
              structural level.  The specific aims are (1) structure-function                
              relationship of the autokinase and eIF-2. activities if HRI; (2)               
              molecular mechanisms in the regulation of HRI by heme.                         
              The methods to be employed are recombinant DNA techniques,                     
              polymerase chain reaction, synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides ,                
              high pressure liquid chromatography, amino acid microsequencing.               
              In vitro transcription and translation, protein kinase assays, gel             
              electrophoresis, deoxynucleotide sequencing, expression of HRI                 
              protein in recombinant baculovirus, immunoprecipitation and Western            
              Blot analysis.                                                                 
              HRI is a key regulator of protein synthesis, a process which is                
              essential for the regulation of cell growth, differentiation,                  
              antiviral response and hormonal responses.  Structure-function                 
              analysis of HRI will advance our knowledge on the regulation of                
              protein kinases which are vital in the regulation of various                   
              cellular processes.
