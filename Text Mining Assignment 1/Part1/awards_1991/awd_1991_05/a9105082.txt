Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a                  
              computer system to be installed and operated in the Institute for              
              the Study of the Continents at Cornell University. The University              
              is committed to providing matching funds.                                      
                   The equipment will consist of a high-performance workstation,             
              high-resolution plotter, and large capacity data storage. The                  
              Institute for the Study of the Continents provides basic computer              
              resources for geoscience research at Cornell. Workstations are                 
              linked to the Cornell Supercomputer Center. The new system will be             
              used in this capacity in computing intensive projects of the                   
              Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiling, the Andes Project,            
              and the Global Basin Research Network.
