Abstract    :
              This project is for a geochemical and isotopic study of basalts                
              and differentiated lavas of two Samoan shield volcanoes.  This                 
              will be the first systematic evaluation of the full chemical                   
              stratigraphy of a Samoan shield volcano, and will provide an                   
              important comparison to several volcanoes studied in this way in               
              Hawaii and Tahiti.  The study can be accomplished using samples                
              already in existing collections, but the PIs also have the                     
              opportunity to carry out some additional sampling and field                    
              studies in September, 1991.  The effort will focus on obtaining                
              new isotopic data on 20-25 additional samples selected on the                  
              basis of trace-element data, and acquisition of a much needed set              
              of rare-earth abundances throughout the range of lava                          
              compositions.  These will be particularly important to compare to              
              analyses obtained by ion microprobe on clinopyroxenes in Samoan                
              ultramafic xenolith and on lava phenocrysts.  This award will                  
              also allow completion of a doctoral dissertation at Scripps
