Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of an                 
              inductively-coupled mass spectrometer to be installed and operated             
              in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of               
              Minnesota. The University is committed to providing matching funds.            
                   The equipment will be used to provide key geochemical analyses            
              for a variety of research programs supported by NSF in earth                   
              sciences and oceanography. These projects are involved in the                  
              laboratory and field aspects of fluid-rock interactions, fluid-                
              mineral equilibria and isotopic and trace element studies, as well             
              as limnological research.
