Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The durability of concrete is an important factor in the long time             
              performance and safety of concrete structures.                                 
              this project will investigate the effects of various admixtures,               
              embedded materials, and different mix combinations or the                      
              durability of the concrete.  Analytical and experimental                       
              investigations will be conducted.                                              
                                                                                             
              This is also a joint project with Canada.
