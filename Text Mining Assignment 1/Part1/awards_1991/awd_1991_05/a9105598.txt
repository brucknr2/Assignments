Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at the University of Missouri-                    
              Columbia will purchase computing equipment which will be                       
              dedicated to support research in applied and mathematical                      
              statistics.  The equipment will be used for several research                   
              projects including, in particular:                                             
                                                                                             
              1. Topics in nonparametric function estimation                                 
                                                                                             
              2. Bayesian hierarchical models
