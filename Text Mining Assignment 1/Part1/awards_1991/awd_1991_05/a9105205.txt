Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for partial support for a conference in                  
              hadron spectroscopy and a one week school in the subject,                      
              aimed at graduate students and postdoctoral associates, to be                  
              held the week immediately before the conference.  The proposed                 
              venue for both events is the University of Maryland at College                 
              Park.  The conference is fourth in a biennial series that                      
              began at the University of Maryland in 1985, and was supported                 
              by NSF in that year.  It has since circulated through KEK in                   
              Japan in 1987, Ajjacio (Corsica) in 1989 and is now proposed                   
              for Maryland in 1991.  Broadly interpreted, in the sense of                    
              including both light and heavy quark hadron states, the                        
              subject is of direct interest to all experimental and most                     
              theoretical physicists.  The focus of the proposed conference                  
              is likely to be somewhat more on the light quark states where                  
              interest is still quite widespread.  At the present time, it                   
              appears that at least one hundred persons have expressed an                    
              interest in attending the conference.  The school is also                      
              likely to be well attended at the level proposed of about 20                   
              students.
