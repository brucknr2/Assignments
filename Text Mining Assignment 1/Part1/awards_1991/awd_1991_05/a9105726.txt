Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this proposal is to study chloroplast mRNA                      
              processing, with an emphasis on mRNA splicing, as a way to enhance             
              our understanding of chloroplast biogenesis and function.  Previous            
              results have posed intriguing questions about the processing and               
              splicing of a gene cluster in spinach chloroplasts that encodes                
              four of the nine chloroplast ATP synthase subunits.  Preliminary               
              data suggests that chloroplast mRNA splicing may result in multiple            
              branch points within the same intron.  One of the three objectives             
              of this proposal is to investigate those preliminary results.  The             
              PI has detected splicing activity in spinach chloroplast extracts.             
              Tow objectives of this proposal are dedicated to the stabilization             
              and initial characterization studies on this in vitro splicing                 
              activity.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              It is not known whether splicing is a rate limiting step in the                
              control of gene expression, but it is an indispensable step in the             
              production of several essential gene products.  In this proposal,              
              the plan is to study chloroplast splicing both in vivo and in vitro            
              in order to begin to understand this complex process and the                   
              factors that regulate it.  Chloroplast gene expression is regulated            
              by several factors including light, heat stress, and physiological             
              factors.  This work will help to elucidate control points that                 
              regulate chloroplast biogenesis and function.//
