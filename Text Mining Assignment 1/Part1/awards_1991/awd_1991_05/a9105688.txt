Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study stability problems for              
              viscous flows in the limit of very large Reynolds numbers (small               
              viscosities) using techniques from dynamo theory.  In particular,              
              he will apply asymptotic methods of the WKB-Maslov type to                     
              problems in vorticity generation.  Such methods have proved                    
              useful in studying analogous problems related to the "fast"                    
              dynamo effect.  The basic idea is to calculate the Lagrangian                  
              trajectories responsible for the vorticity generation in much the              
              same way that one calculates the Lyapunov exponents responsible                
              for the generation of magnetic fields in electrically conducting               
              fluids.                                                                        
                   A technique that is used often in science may be called                   
              "reasoning by analogy".  In this project the principal                         
              investigator will use analogies between the properties of vortex               
              lines in viscous fluids and magnetic lines in electrically                     
              conducting fluids to study the generation and propagation of fast              
              vortices in slightly viscous fluids by making use of ideas from                
              dynamo (magnetic field generation) theory.  The research has                   
              relevance to phenomena that occur inside the earth, in the                     
              atmosphere and in outer space.
