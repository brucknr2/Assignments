Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed work is the development of                            
              detailed three-dimensional models of inner lead                                
              bonds in TAB devices.  The models will be used to                              
              determine the effect of various bond defects on                                
              mechanical performance of the bond and to                                      
              determine new experimental approaches to measuring                             
              bond quality.  The proposed analytical technique                               
              relies on finite element analysis and incorporation of                         
              analysis developed by other researchers into a                                 
              phenomenological model.  The proposed                                          
              experimental techniques uses a magnetically driven                             
              manipulator to apply a well controlled shear force at                          
              precise locations of the bond.
