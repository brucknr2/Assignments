Abstract    :
              Extracorporeal shock wave                                                      
              lithotripsy has become a commonly                                              
              used noninvasive therapy for                                                   
              crushing kidney stone.  The                                                    
              therapy, however, may lead to                                                  
              injury.  The proposed research is                                              
              to gain new fundamental knowledge                                              
              about the focusing of shock waves                                              
              and their interaction with kidney                                              
              stones.  Pressure transducers                                                  
              (based on PVDF piezoelectric                                                   
              material and differential

              for characterizing the developed                                               
              pressures; the transducers also                                                
              have the potential of being used as                                            
              exposure meters in a clinical                                                  
              environment.  If successful, the                                               
              research will result in new                                                    
              technology that will reduce the                                                
              risk associated with lithotripsy.
