Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The formation of regular and predictable patterns during                       
              development of multicellular plants require that positional                    
              information be available to cells, which then differentiate                    
              accordingly.  The mechanisms by which these patterns of discrete               
              cell types are formed in response to position is a long -standing              
              problem in developmental biology.  A cell that reacts in a                     
              special way in consequence of its association with another must                
              do so because it acquires "information" from that other cell.                  
              Such information must be carried through either chemical or                    
              physical signals.  In plants the nature of these signals, their                
              origin, and how they are transmitted are unknown.  The overall                 
              goal of the experiments described in this proposal is to achieve               
              a better understanding of the controls of gene expression which                
              govern these complex interactions during plant cell                            
              differentiation.  These experiments will continue to characterize              
              the communication factors which convey positional information in               
              plants.
