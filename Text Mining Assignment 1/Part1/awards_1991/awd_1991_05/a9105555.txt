Abstract    :
              DNA replication in Escherichia coli is catalyzed by DNA polymerase             
              III holoenzyme.  This enzyme, thought to coordinate leading and                
              lagging strand synthesis as an asymmetric dimer, contains                      
              polymerizing activity in a core plus essential auxiliary factors.              
              Two of the auxiliary factors, tau and gamma, are the products of               
              one gene, dnaX.  They are synthesized in equimolar amounts and,                
              although their exact functions are unknown, it is possible that                
              their asymmetry.  Tau is the translation product of the full-length            
              dnaX reading frame; the shorter gamma shares the same N-terminal               
              sequence as tau but is terminated within the tau reading frame by              
              a programmed ribosomal frameshift followed by a nonsense condon in             
              the new frame.  Knowledge of the sequence and mechanism of gamma               
              formation makes possible investigations of tau and gamma functions.            
              Specifically, the requirement for each tau and gamma in vivo                   
              (because the in vitro data are equivocal) will be tested by                    
              generation of mutant dnaX alleles which synthesize only tau or only            
              gamma and gene replacement.  Other mutant genes and proteins                   
              altered in ATPase and suspected helicase motifs will be analyzed               
              in vivo and in vitro to correlate loss of complementing activity,              
              ATPase, helicase, and ability to support polymerization in vitro.              
              Second, dnaX gene expression will be preliminarily characterized.              
              Third, the sequenced of dnaA mutations which suppress dnaX(Ts)                 
              mutants will be determined.
