Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Timing of early embryonic cell divisions is crucial for                        
              establishing the coordinated interactions necessary for normal                 
              development. Dr. Hecht will investigate a pathway responsible for              
              initiating zygotic control of cell lineage division in the                     
              nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. The regulation and function of               
              the emb-29V gene, defined by temperature sensitive alleles that                
              arrest embryonic cell divisions at or near the G2/M interface,                 
              will be investigated. An understanding of the mechanisms                       
              controlling the expression and function of this strict non-                    
              maternal gene product will provide insights into those factors                 
              that interact with an important genetic element required for                   
              entry into the mitotic stage of different embryonic cell                       
              lineages. To achieve these goals the emb-29 gene will be                       
              identified and isolated by transformation rescue. Emb-29 will                  
              then be sequenced. Probes for emb-29's mRNA and its encoded                    
              protein will be used to determine the cell lineage onset and                   
              intracellular localizations of the emb-29 gene product. Putative               
              DNA regulatory domains will be identified by a comparative                     
              sequence analysis of the homologous gene from the related species              
              C. briggsae. The in vivo and in vitro function of these domains                
              will be determined by transformation and DNA gel-shift assays,                 
              respectively. The properties of the recombinantly expressed gene               
              product will be biochemically determined and in conjunction with               
              the isolation and analysis of suppressor genes, the investigation              
              of interacting components will be initiated. In this manner, the               
              genetically and biochemically defined elements involved in the                 
              modulation and expression of an essential gene controlling one of              
              the pathways necessary for embryonic cell lineage proliferation                
              will be understood.
