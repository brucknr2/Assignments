Abstract    :
              The Statistics department at Rutgers University will                           
              purchase equipment which will be dedicated to the support                      
              research in Statistics and Statistical computing.  The equipment               
              will be used for several research projects, including in                       
              particular, Statistical Methods for Image analysis; Recursive                  
              Estimation procedures in Time Series; Statistical Tests through                
              Tolerance Limits; and Applications of Symbolic Computations to                 
              Statistics.  The equipment consists of 4 SUN Sparcstations SLC                 
              and one Sparcstation II linked to an existing server.
