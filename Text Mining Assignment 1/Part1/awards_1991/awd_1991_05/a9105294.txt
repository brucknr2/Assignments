Abstract    :
                   This award will provide one-half the funds needed to acquire              
              an electron beam microprobe that will be installed and operated in             
              the Department of Geological Sciences at the State University of               
              New York in Binghamton. The University is committed to providing               
              the remaining funds needed for the acquisition of this instrument.             
                   The instrument will be accessible to researchers at SUNY-                 
              Binghamton and will also be run as a regional facility to                      
              accommodate the need for quantitative micro-analysis by a regional             
              group of educational institutions and by industry in the region.               
              Application areas at SUNY-Binghamton include earth sciences,                   
              materials science, chemistry, physics, anthropology and                        
              engineering.
