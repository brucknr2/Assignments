Abstract    :
              This project is a one-year study focused on clarifying the field,              
              age, spatial, and genetic relationship of normal and strongly-                 
              contaminated and reduced peraluminous granite plutons with                     
              specific pre-batholith wall rocks of the Caucasus.  Biotite                    
              mineral and whole rock chemistry will be used to characterize the              
              redox state and halogen contents of magmatic and hydrothermal                  
              fluids.  Four weeks of field work in the U.S.S.R. is required for              
              five north-south transects crossing the Caucasus, ahd the                      
              research will be done in collaboration with three Soviet                       
              geologists.  A return visit for them to the U.S. will provide an               
              opportunity for them to engage in research of magma/wall                       
              interaction.
