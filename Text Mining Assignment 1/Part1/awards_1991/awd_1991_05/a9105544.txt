Abstract    :
              Support is requesting for the 35th annual meeting of the Wind                  
              River Conference on Genetic Exchange, to be held at the Wind                   
              River Ranch, Estes Park, Colorado, Jun 5-9, 1991.  This                        
              conference is primarily concerned with the biology and molecular               
              biology of genetic exchange systems in a variety of procaryotic                
              and eukaryotic systems, and is the major annually occurring                    
              meeting  devoted to this subject area internationally.  One                    
              significant feature of these meetings is their accessibility to                
              graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose travel funds               
              frequently are limited.  Specifically to address this problem, we              
              request funds to provide travel and support scholarships to                    
              facilitate the attendance of graduate students and post-doctoral               
              students working in various areas of genetic exchange and related              
              subject areas.  The amount requested is $7,000.  Corporate funds               
              are also solicited to provide expenses for 2-3 distinguished                   
              scientists as plenary speakers.
