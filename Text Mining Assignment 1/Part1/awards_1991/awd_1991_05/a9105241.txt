Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term objective of this project is to identify proteins                
              involved in abscisic acid (ABA) action and study their function                
              by physiological, biochemical and molecular genetic analysis.                  
              Genes required for ABA action have been identified by isolating                
              and characterizing mutants with altered sensitivity to ABA in                  
              Arabidopsis. Dr. Finkelstein's previous studies indicated that                 
              three ABI loci (abi1,abi2 and abi3) function in overlapping                    
              pathways of ABA response and the loss of function in both                      
              pathways was lethal in pollen. She will extend these studies by                
              cloning the relevant loci, either by chromosome walking or                     
              genomic subtraction, focussing on ABI2. The specific objectives                
              are: 1) Investigate timing and basis of loss of viability in                   
              abi2abi3 pollen, 2)Isolate new radiation induced abi mutants, 3)               
              Isolate overlapping yeast artificial chromosomes spanning the                  
              region between the most tightly linked restriction fragment                    
              length polymorphism markers flanking the ABI1 locus.                           
              Alternatively, if any of the radiation induced mutations are                   
              allelic to abi2, she will use genomic subtraction to clone the                 
              region deleted in the mutant, 4) Identify the subset of genomic                
              clones showing tightest linkage to ABI2 by RFLP fine mapping                   
              these clones with a panel of recombinant families, 5) Identify                 
              the ABI2 gene within this subset by complementation of the mutant              
              phenotype, and 6) Isolate and characterize cDNA clones                         
              corresponding to the ABI2 gene.
