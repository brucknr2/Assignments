Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is the measurement and                     
              interpretation of the horizontal component of the electric field               
              very close to the lightning stroke.  The experiment will take                  
              place at the Kennedy Space Center during Summer 1991 and will                  
              involve rocket-triggered lightning.  The proposed measurements                 
              and analysis are important for the modelling of the lower part of              
              the lightning channel, in particular the lightning attachment                  
              process and the coupling of electromagnetic energy from very                   
              close lightning to overhead wires.                                             
                   The electromagnetics research group from the Ecole                        
              Polytechnique Federal de Lausanne in Switzerland has offered to                
              share with the University of Florida their electric field                      
              measuring equipment:  2 Thomson CSF electric field sensors                     
              (wideband EMP sensors ideally suited for close lightning                       
              measurements), a LeCroy 4 channel digitalizing oscilloscope, and               
              a controlling computer.  Additionally the group will provide one               
              experienced Ph.D. student and possibly one additional graduate                 
              student who will travel to the Kennedy Space Center for Summer                 
              1991 to cooperate with our research group in making the proposed               
              electric field measurements and who will bring the Swiss                       
              equipment to Gainesville and help in the calibration in Spring                 
              1991.
