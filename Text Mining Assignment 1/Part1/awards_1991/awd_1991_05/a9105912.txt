Abstract    :
              This proposal presents experiments to delineawte the function                  
              domains of the adenoviral encoded 21 kDa E1B protein required,                 
              along with adenoviral E1A protein and the 55 kDa E1b protein for               
              cellular transformation.  Evidence suggests that this protein leads            
              to increase levels of another adenovirus mRNA that encodes a viral             
              capsid protein, polypeptide IX (pIX).  The 21 KDa E1B protein is               
              also known to stabilize DNA in transfected and infected cells.  The            
              experiments presented are designed to determine if the E1B protein             
              also activates gene expression using the already well studies pIX              
              transcription unit.  The function of the 21 kDa E1B protein during             
              oncogenesis is unknown and its contribution to cellular                        
              transformation in the presence of adenovirus encoded E1A proteins              
              and the 55 kDa E1B protein is also unknown  Therefore, the                     
              possibility that this protein activates gene expression will be                
              analyzed and the role of this activity in transformation will be               
              examined.                                                                      
              The functional domains of the 21 kDa E1B protein will be mapped                
              using deletional analysis and examines for activation of pIX gene              
              expression in transient expression assays.  The pIX promoter region            
              will be altered to test for activation by the E1B protein.m  If                
              confirmation of pIX gene activation by E1B protein is obtained and             
              a specific domain of the E1B protein that mediates this activity is            
              identified, then this domain will also be tested for DNA                       
              stabilization property and transforming ability using appropriate              
              viral constructs.                                                              
              The possible affects of the 21 kDa E1B protein on the retention of             
              proteins bound to the pIX promoter will be examines using gel                  
              retardation assays.  Extracts from uninfected and infected cells               
              will be compared for differences in retardation of a DNA fragment              
              containing the pIX  promoter region.  Identification of the                    
              proteins involved in retarding the pIX promoter DNA will be                    
              performed using competing oligonucleotide containing the already               
              identified pIX promoter elements.                                              
              The ultimate goal is to determine if E1B protein does activate gene            
              expression, if this activity correlates will transforming activity.            
              These analyses will provide the foundation for extended analyses of            
              the mechanism by which E1B protein activates pIX gene expression in            
              a system defined in vitro.  This research may apply to the means by            
              which the 21 kDa E1B protein participates in cellular                          
              transformation.
