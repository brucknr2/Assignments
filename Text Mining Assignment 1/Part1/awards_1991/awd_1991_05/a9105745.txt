Abstract    :
                   The Department of Statistics at Colorado State University                 
              will purchase a central server and two workstations dedicated to               
              support research in time series analysis, statistical inference,               
              and statistical computing.  The equipment will be used for                     
              several research projects including those described below.                     
                                                                                             
              1. Multivariate times series modelling using state-space                       
              techniques.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              2. Automatic data-driven bandwidth selection criteria will be                  
              evaluated in the multivariate setting.                                         
                                                                                             
              3. Confidence interval procedures for various functions of                     
              variances in unbalanced variance components models will be                     
              studied.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              4. Distribution-free inference procedures in the linear model                  
              framework using permutation methods will be investigated.  A key               
              component of this investigation will be the development of a                   
              permutation package containing numerical and graphical                         
              descriptive tools for implementing permutation methods for a                   
              broad class of problems.
