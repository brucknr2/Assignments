Abstract    :
                   This proposal deals with control of linear systems driven by              
              poorly known Markov processes and white noise.  Nonlinear                      
              filtering techniques can give the conditional probability                      
              distribution of the current state of the Markov process in terms               
              of system's history.  In this way the controller learns about the              
              poorly known processes based on the observation of their past                  
              performance.                                                                   
                   Specific examples of applications of the type of control                  
              problems discussed in this proposal include models of solar                    
              electric generating stations, where the Markov process is the                  
              variation of the solar power due to cloud cover, and certain                   
              pursuit-evasion problems, where the pursuer bases its strategy on              
              the past performance of the evader.
