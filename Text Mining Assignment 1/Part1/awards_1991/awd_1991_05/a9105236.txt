Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will examine fluid behavior in three                
              types of crustal environments (contact aureole, extensional                    
              metamorphic terrane, collisional metamorphic terrane).  The results            
              will help geologists to better understand the relationship between             
              petrologic and isotopic data and will improve the coordinated use              
              of these tools as indicators of geologic conditions as they                    
              affected rocks of the Earth's crust.
