Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Although steroid ligand receptor interactions are known to be                  
              important in vertebrate embryogenesis and pattern formation,                   
              their role in determining the segmentation pattern of the                      
              Drosophila embryo is not as clear. Several proteins required for               
              embryonic development in Drosophila have homology to vertebrate                
              steroid receptors, but the ligands for these putative receptors                
              have not yet been identified. Thus, the biological significance                
              of the homology between the ligand binding domains in Drosophila               
              and vertebrate proteins remains in question. This proposal aims                
              to identify the ligand for the putative steroid receptor in                    
              Drosophila encoded by the tailless gene. Using a genetic assay                 
              for the functional activation of the tailless protein, ten                     
              different steroids will be tested for their effects on the                     
              segmentation pattern of Drosophila embryos. Upon the                           
              identification of a putative ligand for the tailless receptor,                 
              the activation of genes regulated by tailless will be measured in              
              the presence of the tailless ligand. Using this approach, it will              
              be possible to elucidate more easily the role of steroid receptor              
              ligand interactions in embryonic pattern formation through the                 
              application of Drosophila molecular genetics.
