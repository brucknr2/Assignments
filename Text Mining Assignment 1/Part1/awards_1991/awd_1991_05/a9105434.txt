Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Colorado State  University will               
              purchase a color graphics workstation that will be dedicated to                
              support research in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment                  
              will be used for several research projects, including in                       
              particular:                                                                    
                                                                                             
              1. Low-dimensional characterization of large-scale patterns in                 
              dynamic systems (M. Kirby)                                                     
                                                                                             
              2. The Vesalius Project (H.P Miranda).                                         
                                                                                             
              Each of these projects requires extensive code development, with               
              a heavy emphasis on graphical output.
