Abstract    :
              Translation is a key which gene expression can be regulated.                   
              Mutations that alter translation initiation in yeast have been                 
              defined positive (GNC) and negative (GCD) translation regulators               
              of the transcriptional activator encoded by GCN4.  The objective               
              of this proposal is to determine the basis for genetic interactions            
              between two of these translational regulators, those encoded by                
              GCN3 and GCD11.  GCN3, which has been characterized at the                     
              molecular level, also exhibits both genetic and biochemical                    
              interactions with translation initiation factor eIF-2.  We have                
              cloned the GCD11 gene and now propose to characterize GCD11 at the             
              molecular level by determining its nucleotide sequences, its                   
              requirement for viability, and its patten of transcription and                 
              translation.  We will raise antibodies against GCN3 and yeast eIF-             
              2, to seek physical evidence for interactions among these gene                 
              products.  These studies are important for bridges the gap between             
              extensive in vitro biochemical analyses of translation factors and             
              their proposed roles in vivo.
