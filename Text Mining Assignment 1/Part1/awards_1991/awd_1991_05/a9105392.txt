Abstract    :
              Nodulin genes are plant genes which are specifically induced                   
              during the formation of nitrogen-fixing root- stem nodules on                  
              leguminous plants.  Early nodulin (Enod) genes are expressed                   
              within 10 days after inoculation and play a role in the rhizobial              
              infection process and nodule ontogeny.  Enod genes are not only                
              symbiotically induced and developmentally controlled, but are                  
              also expressed in a tissue specific manner.  The Enod2 gene is                 
              symbiotically activated in the nodule parenchyma cells and                     
              encodes a hydroxyproline rich protein, which probably is targeted              
              to the plant cell wall, where it may be involved in creating an                
              oxygen diffusion barrier.  The focus of this proposal is to                    
              elucidate the signal transduction pathway involved in the                      
              expression of the Enod2 gene from the tropical stem-nodulated                  
              legume, Sesbania rostrata (SrEnod2).  The SrEnod2 gene can be                  
              induced rapidly and specifically by physiologically significant                
              concentrations of cytokinins.  This gene is therefore not only an              
              ideal candidate to study nodule-specific plant gene expression,                
              but also serves as a unique model to study plant gene induction                
              be cytokinin.  The ability to manipulate the bacterial "inducer"               
              offers a powerful experimental approach to study the process of                
              plant cell division and differentiation.
