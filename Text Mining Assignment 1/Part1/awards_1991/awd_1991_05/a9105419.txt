Abstract    :
                This research is to map lateral variations of the fine structure             
              of seismic velocities in the upper mantle and to relate these                  
              variations to fundamental geodynamical processes.  The technical               
              basis for the investigation is the application of two theoretical              
              techniques developed under previous NSF grants:  the first uses                
              long-period, SH-polarized ScS reverberations to image the vertical             
              profile of mantle reflectivity along short arcs; the second is a               
              general technique for extracting phase information in the form of              
              frequency-dependent travel times from complex parts of seismograms             
              and inverting this information to obtain earth structure.  By means            
              of the combined application of these two techniques to reflected               
              and refracted seismic waves, the investigator will study individual            
              seismic profiles in the upper mantle to determine structure,                   
              composition and dynamics.
