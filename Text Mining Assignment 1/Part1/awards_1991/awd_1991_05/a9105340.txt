Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding toward the acquisition of a               
              single crystal diffraction system and a rotating anode  X-ray                  
              source. The equipment is to be installed in the Department of                  
              Geological Sciences at the University of Colorado. The University              
              is committed to providing the remaining 50% funding required.                  
                   The diffraction system will be used in research focused on the            
              effects of crystal structure and bonding on the inter- and intra-              
              crystalline distribution of elements and isotopes in mineral                   
              systems, especially those found in the Earth's mantle.
