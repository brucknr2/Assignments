Abstract    :
                   Professor Corwin will continue his investigations in harmonic             
              analysis and representation theory for real nilpotent Lie groups               
              and reductive p-adic groups.  In the former area he will continue              
              work with F. Greenleaf on homogeneous spaces of nilpotent Lie                  
              groups, particularly on problems characterizing the algebra of                 
              invariant differential operators for such spaces.  Concerning p-               
              adic groups, he will extend his work on supercuspidal                          
              representations.  This problem is central in questions of                      
              representation theory for these groups.                                        
                   Professor Corwin's project involves questions in the                      
              representation theory of groups.  Group theory is basically the                
              study of symmetry.  If a system looks the same from every point in             
              space then the symmetry group contains the group of translations.              
              In particular situations, a knowledge of the abstract group is not             
              enough and one needs to consider concrete realizations of the group            
              of transformations, in other words, a representation.
