Abstract    :
              The long-term goal of this research is to understand the                       
              mechanisms that control cellular polarity during the                           
              eukaryotic cell cycle.  The PI used the yeast Saccharomyces                    
              cerevisiae as a model system to study this process because it                  
              displays two different aspects of cellular polarity and is a                   
              relatively simple eukaryote that can be easily manipulated                     
              both physiologically and genetically using both classical and                  
              molecular genetic techniques (9).  The goal of this research is to             
              characterize the biochemical functions of the S.cerevisiae CDC42               
              (CDC42Sc) gene product, a putative GTP-binding protein.  The PI                
              will purify wild-type and mutant Cdc42Sc proteins and investigate              
              (i) their capability to bind and hydrolyze GTP and (ii) their                  
              potential phosphorylation states.  He will also isolate and                    
              characterize new proteins that interact with the Cdc42Sc protein.              
              The existence of a human homolog of CDC42Sc, which he and others               
              have shown to function in yeast (78,112) and to be an excellent in             
              vitro phosphosubstrate for the epidermal growth factor (EGF)                   
              receptor tyrosine kinase (44), suggests that the molecular                     
              mechanisms involved in the control of cellular polarity could be               
              conserved between yeasts and higher eukaryotes.  Correlation of                
              information obtained in S. cerevisiae to that from higher                      
              eukaryotes could provide valuable clues to the nature and function             
              of low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins and to the                        
              intracellular signal-transduction mechanisms that control cellular             
              polarity.
