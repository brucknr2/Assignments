Abstract    :
                   Professors Paulsen and Blecher will study questions arising in            
              the theory of operator spaces and operator algebras, their duals               
              and their tensor products.  They will also study reproducing kernel            
              Hilbert spaces and Hilbert modules.                                            
                   Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite matrices of              
              complex numbers.  These operators have applications in every area              
              of applied science as well as in pure mathematics.  This type of               
              research is an attempt to classify certain important families of               
              such objects.
