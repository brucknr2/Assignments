Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to deploy a section of deep current meter moorings              
              for two years off Brazil near the Equatorto study the trans-                   
              equatorial flow of bottom in the Western Atlantic as part of the               
              World Oceans Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Deep Basin Experiment.              
              In addition to the current meter deployments, the PIs will conduct             
              a limited Hydrographic along the mooring line.
