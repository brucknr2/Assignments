Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to examine long-distance virus                  
              movement in plants in order to obtain a better understanding of                
              plant virus resistance.  In the past few years, virus movement                 
              studies have centered around the role of virus-encoded factors in              
              cell to cell movement.  This proposal focusses on host factors                 
              which are involved in cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) movement in              
              Arabidopsis plants.  New techniques that will be used to follow                
              virus movement include a whole plant in situ hybridization                     
              procedure and virus transactivation of a resident reporter gene.               
              These techniques will be used to examine different Arabidopsis                 
              ecotypes and screen for Arabidopsis mutants with resistance to                 
              virus infection and variation in patterns of long distance virus               
              movement.  Genes encoding movement traits will be cloned using map-            
              based cloning or deletion subtraction hybridization.                           
                                                                                             
              Insight into mechanisms involved in the movement of viruses in                 
              plants will suggest mechanisms for preventing such movement and                
              thereby creating a virus resistant plant.***//
