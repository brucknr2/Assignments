Abstract    :
                   This award will provide half the funds needed for the                     
              acquisition of modern computer equipment to upgrade the computer               
              facilities in the Department of Geological Sciences at The                     
              University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). UTEP is committed to provide            
              the additional funds necessary for this acquisition.                           
                   This award will make it possible to set up two modern,                    
              powerful workstations. These workstations will be necessary to                 
              allow faculty to expand their capabilities in modelling and seismic            
              reflection processing. With the addition of this new computer                  
              equipment there will be a reduced load on the existing system which            
              will allow for greater access for course-related computing. The PIs            
              stress the importance of involving undergraduates, a large number              
              of whom are minority, in modern computer applications.
