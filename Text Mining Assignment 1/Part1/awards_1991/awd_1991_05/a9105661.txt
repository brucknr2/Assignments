Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will look into a               
              fundamental problem of importance in statistical mechanics today,              
              namely establishing connections between microscopic phenomena and              
              macroscopic phenomena.  More specifically, he will try to                      
              understand the relationship between microscopic laws that                      
              describe the interactions of many particles and macroscopic                    
              observables such as temperature that characterize the bulk                     
              properties of a phenomenon, in the context of quantum mechanics.               
              Part of the difficulty here lies in the fact that physicists                   
              cannot agree about what the microscopic laws are for the quantum               
              mechanical formalism.  The principal investigator will attempt to              
              establish such laws and then examine their phenomenological                    
              consequences in a rigorous fashion.                                            
                   An easily describable and observable phenomenon such as the               
              temperature of your morning cup of coffee is what physicists and               
              applied mathematicians call a "macroscopic" or bulk property of                
              the coffee, that is, it is a measurable quantity that describes                
              how hot or cold the liquid is, based upon some conventional                    
              scale.  The temperature however is actually governed by the                    
              collective behavior of the many molecules and atoms that are in                
              ceaseless motion inside of the cup and that are governed by the                
              "microscopic" laws of interaction.  In this proposal the                       
              principal investigator will examine the relationship between                   
              microscopic and macroscopic effects in the context of quantum                  
              mechanics, the ultimate theory of matter.
