Abstract    :
                This research follows ongoing work in New Zealand that shows                 
              growth rates of lichen to be calibrated accurately by using                    
              historical coseismic rockfalls.  This is an excellent way to                   
              learn about lichen growth factors and prehistorical earthquakes.               
              Application of this technique to earthquake-prone California                   
              areas will test the technique in a different geographical and                  
              seismic setting and add an additional tool to the study and                    
              estimation of earthquake risk.  This research is a component of                
              the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
