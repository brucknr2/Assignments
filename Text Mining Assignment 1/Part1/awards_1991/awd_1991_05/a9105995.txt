Abstract    :
              RNA polymerase is the principal enzyme of gene expression and the              
              target for genetic regulation.  Its basic structure-functional                 
              features are highly conserved among all living organisms. The broad            
              goal of this project is the understanding of the molecular                     
              mechanism of RNA polymerase basic function.  To this end a combined            
              genetic and biochemical approach will be taken using as model the              
              RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli.  The collaboration takes                 
              advantages of the biochemical strength of the U.S. side and                    
              specifically, it is proposed to generate an exhaustive collection              
              of in-frame linker insertions and deletions in the cloned gene rpoB            
              which encodes the B subunit of core RNA polymerase. The mutant RNA             
              polymerase holoenzyme (a2BBo) will then be prepared for biochemical            
              characterization by in vitro reconstitution from the individual                
              subunits.  The subunits will be obtained by overexpressing them                
              from plasmids carrying the three rpo genes under the control of                
              inducible promoter.  The malfunctioning of RNA polymerase caused               
              by the mutations will be characterized using an arsenal of in vitro            
              assays which would allow to monitor and quantitate individual steps            
              of the enzyme's functional cycle. This approach is anticipated to              
              define and map the structural elements of the enzyme which carry               
              out the multitude of RNA polymerase biochemical functions.
