Abstract    :
                   The investigator studies stability of solutions of some                   
              reaction-diffusion equations that lck compactness or Liapunov                  
              functionals.  Here specific issues include optimal conditions on               
              the initial value for global existence of a solution, limiting                 
              sets of global solutions, and topologies in which equilibria or                
              traveling waves are stable.  He also studies point-concentration               
              phenomena of solutions of elliptic equations in unbounded                      
              domains.  The rates and locations of concentration are among the               
              main questions.                                                                
                   All the equations studied are model equations from                        
              biology, chemistry, or mathematical physics.  Better                           
              understanding of these important equations provides insight into               
              the underlying scientific questions.  But a thorough study of the              
              equations is difficult because of a lack of general tools to deal              
              with nonlinear equations. Hence the problems and techniques for                
              solving them are of intrinsic mathematical interest also.
