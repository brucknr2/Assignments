Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A central issue in developmental biology is to identify genes                  
              that are involved in specifying cell types in the appropriate                  
              spatial patterns.  This issue will be investigated by identifying              
              genes and gene products involved in the specification of                       
              different  sensory organs in the fruit fly.  The newly developed               
              FLP recombinase system will be used to screen for mutations that               
              cause defects in sensory organ pattern or development.  Using                  
              this method, essential genes with early lethal phases can be                   
              detected and phenotypes of recessive mutations can be observed in              
              the F1 generation.  More generally, these studies have the                     
              potential for identifying genes that play a role in neuronal and               
              epithelial differentiation in a variety of species.
