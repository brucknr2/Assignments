Abstract    :
                   Recent results presented at the SEDI Conference in Santa Fe,              
              NM this August raised important new questions about the behavior               
              of the geomagnetic field during polarity reversals.  Studies of the            
              Matuyama-Brunhes and upper Olduvai transitions suggest that there              
              may exist a geographical control over the reversal process as                  
              evidence by VGP paths which fall along preferred tracks over the               
              Americas or eastern Asia.  In order to test the existence of a                 
              geographical control over the reversal process and its persistence             
              through time it is necessary to examine records of successive                  
              reversals from multiple sites.  A detailed paleomagnetic study of              
              the polarity transitions bounding the Thvera, Sidufjall and Nunivak            
              subchrons as recorded in the Suva Marl (Fiju) will be carried out.             
              These records should help determine if the variability in Plio-                
              Pleistocene transitional fields results from different                         
              manifestations of a geographically constrained reversal mechanism.
