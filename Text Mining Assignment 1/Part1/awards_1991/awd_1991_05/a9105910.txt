Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this proposal is to understand the dynamical behavior              
              of biological polyelectrolytes, especially DNA, in strongly                    
              interacting solutions.  the interactions may be electrostatic,                 
              excluded volume, entanglement, or some combination.  Such                      
              conditions are the norms inside cells.  The work uses quasielastic             
              light scattering (QLS), forced Rayleigh scattering (FRS), and                  
              small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to shed light on how                       
              interactions influence the diffusional and binding behavior of                 
              biopolymers.  Such influence can have major effects under                      
              physiologically relevant conditions.
