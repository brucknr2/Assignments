Abstract    :
                   This is a study of phase transformations and kinetics studies             
              studies on mantle minerals at high pressures and high temperatures.            
              Instrumentation and techniques to be employed in the proposed study            
              includes diamond-anvil pressure cells, laser-heating system, x-ray             
              diffraction system (either with synchrotron radiation at National              
              Synchrotron Light Source or with in-house x-ray facilities) and                
              analytical transmission electron microscope (ATEM).
