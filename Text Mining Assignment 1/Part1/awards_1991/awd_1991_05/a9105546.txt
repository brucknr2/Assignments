Abstract    :
                   Extension of paleoneurological studies to the spinal cord                 
              allows functional and phylogenetic interpretations of the anatomy              
              and locomotory patterns of fossil taxa previously thought to be                
              inaccessible.  Preliminary morphometric analysis of vertebrae of               
              living mammalian genera indicates that the mammalian spinal cord               
              differs from the reptilian cord in several characters with                     
              osteological ramifications.  These characters can be used to                   
              recognize the appearance of mammalian spinal traits in the fossil              
              record.  A relationship between the size of segmental spinal cord              
              cross-sectional area and locomotory mode has been demonstrated in              
              living reptiles and used to predict limb function in extinct taxa.             
              Measurement of a wide range of living mammalian genera will                    
              establish standards of relative spinal cord size for different                 
              locomotory patterns.  Comparison of these values to those obtained             
              from fossil taxa will allow reconstruction of the adoption of                  
              different patterns of limb use in a variety of mammalian orders.               
              Osteological specimens of living and fossil genera will be studied             
              in a small number of rich museum collections using computer-based              
              imaging.
