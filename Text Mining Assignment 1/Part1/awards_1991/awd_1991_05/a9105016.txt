Abstract    :
              Capillary Zone Electrophoresis (CZE) is probably the simplest and              
              perhaps the most universally useful mode of High Performance                   
              Capillary Electrophoresis (HPCE), which combines the strengths of              
              both conventional electrophoresis in resolving power and High                  
              Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) in the ease and speed of              
              analysis.  A fundamental problem in CZE is to directly control                 
              the zeta potential at the aqueous/capillary interface.  Director               
              control of the zeta potential is essential for manipulating the                
              electroosmotic flow inside the capillary and the adsorption of                 
              macromolecules onto the capillary wall.  An instrumentation                    
              method involving the use of an additional electric field from                  
              outside the capillary for controlling the zeta potential is                    
              therefore proposed in this study.  The fundamentals of this                    
              approach will be studied both experimentally and theoretically                 
              with the proposed capacitor model.  Significant improvements of                
              separation efficiency and resolution of protein mixtures and DNA               
              fragments for both qualitative and quantitative applications will              
              then be demonstrated and achieved.
