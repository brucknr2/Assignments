Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will (1) study fluid connectivity and               
              fluid-assisted diffusive transport in rocks at elevated                        
              temperatures and pressures, (2) apply experimental and analytical              
              techniques he has developed for measuring crystal/fluid partition              
              coefficients to a broad suite of minerals, and (3) evaluate the                
              suitability of ion-beam depth profiling techniques to study                    
              diffusion in minerals.  Results of this investigation will help                
              geologists understand fundamental processes occurring in the Earth.
