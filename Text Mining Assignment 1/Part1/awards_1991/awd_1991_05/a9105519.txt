Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this proposal will be to provide data to firmly                    
              establish a model for the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)                
              detectable site of the multimetal enzyme cytochrome c oxidase.                 
              Comparison between the EPR data at six microwave frequencies                   
              for the copper site of nitrous oxide reductase and the EPR                     
              detectable copper in cytochrome c oxidase will be used to                      
              unravel the EPR data.  Derivatives of cytochrome c oxidase and                 
              nitrous oxide reductase, for which the ratio of copper per                     
              subunit or the ratio of copper to iron vary, will be compared                  
              with the native forms of both enzymes to determine an optimum                  
              functional unit.  Second derivative spectra will provide                       
              resolution of at least nine lines for the EPR detectable site                  
              in cytochrome c oxidase.  Computer simulations from data at six                
              different microwave frequencies will be used to obtain EPR                     
              parameters.  EPR parameters and saturation recovery data will                  
              be used to identify low lying energy states in order to                        
              understand the primary electron transfer pathway.
