Abstract    :
                   This award provides three years of partial support for a                  
              research staff technician to help operate and maintain the Neutron             
              Activation Analysis Laboratory in the Department of Earth,                     
              Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute             
              of Technology. The Institute is committed to providing the rest of             
              the funding needed for the full-time services of the technician.               
                   The Neutron Activation Analysis Laboratory is a facility                  
              dedicated to the analysis of planetary materials, principally                  
              terrestrial rocks and minerals. Principal users are graduate and               
              undergraduate students at MIT and other research institutions in               
              the northeast U.S. Neutron activation analysis is based on the                 
              nuclear properties of elements and is a sensitive technique for                
              elements that are not readily analyzed by other techniques that                
              depend on the electronic energy levels of elements.
