Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objectives of this research are:  (1) modeling and                    
              observational studies of intense downdrafts.  This will involve                
              extensions to the one-dimensional models already in existence,                 
              completion and extension of work on the modeling of axially                    
              symmetric downdrafts including detailed microphysics.  An                      
              extension to three dimensions and inclusion of more complete                   
              microphysics (drop coalescence and breakup in addition to melting              
              and evaporation) in all the models is anticipated.  The results                
              of the various models will be compared with radar and, in                      
              particular, surface meteorological data; (2) A comparison of ZDR               
              measured by a radar, with that calculated from the drop size                   
              distribution inferred from profiler observations, and studies of               
              the size spectra of raindrops and raindrop oscillations by means               
              of profiler observations; (3) Numerical simulations and                        
              theoretical studies of a dual-radar method of measurement of                   
              rainwater content and rainfall rate and tests of the method                    
              against observations; and (4) A theoretical calculation of the                 
              growth of drops by condensation in very slow updrafts, as in                   
              stratiform clouds.
