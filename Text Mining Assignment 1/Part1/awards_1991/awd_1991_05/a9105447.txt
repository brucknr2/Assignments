Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              In humans, progesterone secretion occurs during the estrous cycle              
              and early pregnancy.  Two hormones, luteinizing hormone (LH) and               
              human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), bind to specific LH receptors              
              on cells in the ovary and promote ongoing hormone release by this              
              gland.  Similarities between human and sheep luteal cells make the             
              ewe an excellent model system for studying LH receptor function.               
              The goal of this project is to examine the organization of the LH              
              receptor complex on ovine luteal cells in the non-pregnant animal              
              to learn whether receptor organization affects LH receptor                     
              function.  Laser-optical techniques will be used to determine                  
              hormone binding to the LH receptor leads to receptor self-                     
              association or association with other receptors or with other                  
              membrane proteins.  We will then examine the lipid environment near            
              the LH receptor.  As the corpus luteum ages and eventually ceases              
              to function, changes in the lipid environment may result in                    
              organizational changes in the LH receptor.  These experiments will             
              use a light-activated protein crosslinking agent to explore changes            
              in protein concentration within protein-rich regions of the                    
              membrane. //
