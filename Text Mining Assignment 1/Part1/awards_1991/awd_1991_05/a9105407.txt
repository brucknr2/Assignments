Abstract    :
                   Optimal estimates for three general problems from the theory              
              of elliptic differential equations will be studied.  The first                 
              part of the project involves establishing an Agmon-Miranda                     
              maximum principle or showing the failure of such a principle for               
              all constant coefficient linear elliptic equations in the                      
              dilation invariant setting of Lipschitz domain in Rn.  Included                
              here is the completion of the Lp theory in the manner of Agmon-                
              Douglis-Nirenberg for Lipschitz domains.  The second part                      
              involves strong maximum principles and best constant estimates                 
              for conditioned Brownian motion.  The third part is concerned                  
              with optimal domain decomposition in the Schwarz iteration method              
              employed in certain numerical problems.
