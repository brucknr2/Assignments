Abstract    :
              Sea urchin micromeres arise at the vegetal pole of the embryo by               
              unequal cleavage in the vegetal tier of four cells.  Primary                   
              mesenchyme, the cleavage products of the micromeres, migrate into              
              the blastocoel of the embryo where they interact with the                      
              extracellular matrix (ECM) and differentiate to produce the                    
              embryonic skeleton or spicule.  Evidence from in vitro and in                  
              vivo studies suggests that the micromeres require a permissive                 
              environment or signal to initiate differentiation.  An intact                  
              embryonic ECM is a major component of the permissive environment.              
              The PI has recently shown that micromeres will differentiate in                
              vitro if cultured on a reconstituted basal lamina (matrigel).                  
              Isolated micromeres cultured in sea water alone will not                       
              differentiate.  What is the molecule in the matrigel which                     
              initiates differentiation and how is it related to the endogenous              
              signalling molecule in the embryo.                                             
                   The PI proposes to: (1) identify and purify the spicule                   
              inducing activity (SIA) from the matrigel, (2) characterize the                
              general mechanism of action of SIA, and (3) identify and initiate              
              characterization of the homologous SIA activity from the sea                   
              urchin embryo.
