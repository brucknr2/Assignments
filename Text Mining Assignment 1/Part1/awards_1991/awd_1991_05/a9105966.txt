Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding for a technical position              
              in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of               
              Wisconsin. The funds will be used to support a technician who will             
              assist in the operation of the Department's Radiogenic Isotope                 
              Laboratory. The Radiogenic Isotope Laboratory at Wisconsin provides            
              isotope analysis for a group of active researchers in the                      
              Department of Geology and Geophysics as well as off-campus                     
              collaborators. The laboratory's capabilities include strontium,                
              neodymium, hafnium and lead isotopes, all important systems in the             
              interpretation of geologic processes.
