Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will measure the effect of pressure on              
              the equilibrium sound speeds of multicomponent silicate liquids.               
              He also will experimentally determine the effect of dissolved waer             
              on the iron redox state of silicate liquids. Results of this work              
              will be important in understanding the nature of igneous processes             
              in the Earth.
