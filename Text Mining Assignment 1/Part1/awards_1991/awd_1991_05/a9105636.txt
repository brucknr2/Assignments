Abstract    :
              The principal investigators document the origin of Mesozoic arc                
              development across the Tujunga terrane boundary in southern                    
              California. They will utilize field, petrologic, chemical,                     
              isotopic, and mineralogic information. An important result will be             
              an evaluation of the magmatic processes operative in the middle and            
              upper crustal portions of continental margin magmatic arcs that                
              overlie or contain a sizeable proportion of Proterozoic basement.              
              In general this information will help geologists under-stand the               
              geologic development of the Earth's crust.
