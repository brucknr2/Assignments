Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cable-stayed bridges are becoming more numerous and it is important            
              to design against collapse during construction and in the final                
              condition.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The investigation will consider the effects on the total system if             
              one or more cables fail as a result of several possible causes.                
              Computer programs will be developed for various arrangements of                
              cables.
