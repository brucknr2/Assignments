Abstract    :
              Regulation of RNA stability plays an important role in gene                    
              expression, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood.                 
              This proposal addresses molecular and biochemical factors that                 
              regulate differential turnover of higher plant plastid mRNAs during            
              organelle biogenesis.  Emphasis is placed on the study of highly               
              conserved inverted repeat (IR) sequences found at the 3' ends of               
              plastid mRNAs.  Plastid 3' IRs bind proteins, and act as RNA                   
              processing elements and stability determinants in vitro.  I propose            
              to investigate whether protein:RNA associations at the IR are                  
              involved in the regulation of plastid RNA turnover.   These studies            
              will entail mutagenesis of 3' IR sequences, and purification of                
              RNA-binding proteins  These proteins will be used in functional                
              assays and to raise antibodies, which will be used to investigate              
              developmental changes in protein concentrations, and eventually in             
              isolation of the genes encoding them.  The in vivo structure of                
              plastid mRNAs will be probed by analyzing ribonucleoprotein                    
              particles (RNPs) from plastids, and their half lives will be                   
              quantified by in vivo labeling.  The long-term objectives are to               
              develop a model for the developmental control of plastid mRNA                  
              stability, and to determine if nuclear gene products are among the             
              factors that influence plastid mRNA decay.***//
