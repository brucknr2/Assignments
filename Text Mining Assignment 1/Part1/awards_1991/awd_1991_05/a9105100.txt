Abstract    :
                   Peninsular California contains a number of separate terranes              
              that were translated and accreted to the North American plate in               
              Late Cretaceous through Paleogene time.  This study will examine               
              the motion and accretion history of the Vizcaino terrane, Baja                 
              California, Mexico by an integrated sedimentologic, paleomagnetic,             
              magnetostratigraphic and paleontologic analysis.  The results will             
              help constrain tectonic reconstructions of the Pacific coast of                
              North America.
