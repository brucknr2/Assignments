Abstract    :
                This research is to investigate deformation associated with                  
              oblique plate convergence, with emphasis on Sumatra, Indonesia, by             
              analysis of seismological data.  A model of earthquake slip vector             
              direction, based on Sumatra investigations, is to be investigated              
              for other oblique plate subduction zones.  Similarities are seen               
              between the Sumatra and Aleutian subduction zones.  Comparison of              
              the seismic data with GPS investigations, supported by NSF and the             
              Indonesian government, will provide constraints on the strain field            
              and resultant earthquake activity.  This research is a component               
              of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
