Abstract    :
              This is collaborative research with Stuart Russell at the                      
              University of California-Berkeley (IRI-90204557).  Game-playing                
              is an important domain for two reasons:  first, it exhibits in a               
              clean form two of the major problems facing AI systems, namely                 
              how to pay attention to only a small fraction of the                           
              possibilities in complex domains, and how to use a large quantity              
              of evidential information to make decisions; second, it has long               
              been considered a litmus test for ideas about problem solving and              
              for the quality of AI ideas in general, particularly in                        
              comparison to human intelligence.  Recent work on control of                   
              search by Russell and Wefald and on probabilistic inference in                 
              problem solving domains by Hansson and Mayer, suggests that the                
              PI's will be able to break the grip of brute-force methods on                  
              high-performance systems.  The object of the proposed research is              
              to test out these ideas, with a view to demonstrating feasibility              
              of an intelligent chess program with the potential to perform at               
              a high level.  Should the effort succeed, the PI's will continue               
              with a concerted attempt to defeat the human world champion.  The              
              purely scientific benefits should be significant, in terms of                  
              demonstrating the feasibility of large-scale probabilistic                     
              inference and metalevel control; the benefits to the field of AI               
              in the larger national context will be immeasurable, since                     
              several influential critics will be disarmed, and success will                 
              avoid the extremely deleterious conclusion the "all your need for              
              AI is faster chips".
