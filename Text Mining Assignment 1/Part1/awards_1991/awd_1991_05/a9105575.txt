Abstract    :
                This research is to determine the lateral variation in the                   
              uppermost mantle P-wave velocity and to determine the crustal                  
              thickness in the Middle East and Central Asia.  This region has                
              been affected by continental collision between the Arabian and                 
              Eurasian plates and between the Indian and Eurasian plates.  The               
              method is a tomographic inversion of the large data base of                    
              regional seismic travel times from the Worldwide Standardized                  
              Seismographic Network and other Asian stations.  The derived                   
              uppermost mantle velocities and crustal thicknesses will be used               
              to constrain models for the evolution of continental plateaus                  
              behind collisional mountain belts, and factors controlling                     
              earthquake distribution.  This research is a component of the                  
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
