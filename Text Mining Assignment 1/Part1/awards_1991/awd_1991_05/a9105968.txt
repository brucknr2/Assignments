Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary aim of this research is to investigate how the RNA                 
              degrading machinery of a model plant is controlled.  Specifically,             
              the compartmentalization of ribonucleases (RNase in Arabidopsis,               
              and the temporal and spacial constrains on RNase activity will be              
              studied.  Our initial experiments have identified 15 RNase                     
              activities from Arabidopsis using a substrate-based gel assay.  We             
              plan to investigate the compartmentalization of these enzymes by               
              gradient fractionation and organellar purification.  RNases                    
              associated with vacuoles, nuclei, chloroplasts, and polysomes will             
              be identified.  For one or more selected RNases, protein                       
              purification will be performed and antiserum will be raised and                
              used for further analyses. Preliminary studies indicate that some              
              RNases accumulate differentially in Arabidopsis.  THerefore, the               
              RNase profiles in different organs will be compared at different               
              stages of development, and under different environmental                       
              conditions.  Beyond it contribution to basic knowledge, this                   
              research should enhance the potential use of Arabidopsis as a                  
              genetic model to study the functions of individual RNases in the               
              future.//
