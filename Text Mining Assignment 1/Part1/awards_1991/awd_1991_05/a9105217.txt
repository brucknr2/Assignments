Abstract    :
              Working with Drs. Thomas Ricketts, Paul Guyer, and Gary Hatfield,              
              Dr. Richardson is examining the late 19th and early 20th century               
              philosophical and scientific background in Germany against which               
              logical empiricism was developed in the 1920s.  In particular, he              
              is looking at the problematic of seeking the correct understanding             
              of the role of logic and mathematics in empirical scientific                   
              knowledge that guides most of the scientifically oriented                      
              epistemological schools (Neo-Kantians, Psychologists,                          
              Phenomenologists) in Germany during the fifty years before the rise            
              of logical empiricism.  Moreover, he is investigating the                      
              methodological remarks of the leading scientists of this time                  
              (Helmholtz, Mach, Planck, Poincare, Duhem, Einstein) and the                   
              interpretation of those remarks by German philosophers to see how              
              scientific achievements were philosophically understood in this                
              period.  This is part of a larger project to understand the                    
              philosophical and scientific pressures leading to the development              
              of the though of Rudolf Carnap from his Neo-Kantian first writings             
              through his constructive program of 1928 to mature empiricism in               
              his work in the 1930s.
