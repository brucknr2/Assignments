Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are requested to support the travel of speakers invited to               
              the 50th annual symposium of the Society for Developmental                     
              Biology. This year's symposium is organized by Allan Spradling,                
              current President of the Society, on the subject of "Evolutionary              
              Conservation of Developmental Mechanisms". Each session will                   
              focus on a particular developmental process as studied in a                    
              phylogenetically diverse group of organisms. Sessions will focus               
              on changes in genome structure, stem cell maintenance, sex                     
              determination, signal transduction and pattern formation. It is                
              hoped that underlying mechanisms that have been widely utilized                
              throughout the course of evolution will be revealed. The meeting               
              is usually of medium-size (300-400 registrants) with a single                  
              platform session held at a time (25-30 speakers total), and with               
              60-80 posters. It is attended by graduate students, postdoctoral               
              fellows, and senior researchers. All speakers have been requested              
              to prepare summaries of their presentations of publication in the              
              annual symposium volume.
