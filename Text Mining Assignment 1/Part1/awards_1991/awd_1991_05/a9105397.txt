Abstract    :
              The School of Mathematics at Georgia Institute of Technology (GA               
              Tech.) will purchase a UNIX workstation, to be used for                        
              scientific computation in dynamical systems, as part of a new                  
              graphics and animation lab.  This workstation will be used for                 
              several ongoing research projects, including in particular: (1)                
              parallel wavelet transform, (2) image compression and (3) optimal              
              IFS generation.  These research projects are applications of                   
              iterated function system (IFS) dynamics, which was developed at                
              GA Tech. by Michael Barnsley.  They involve extensive graphics                 
              and digital picture processing.
