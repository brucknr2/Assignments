Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at  the Brigham Young University                 
              will purchase a shared memory multiprocessor computer with high                
              resolution graphics which will be dedicated to support research                
              in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for                  
              several research projects, including in particular:                            
                                                                                             
              1. Numerical Simulation and Visualization for Nonlinear                        
              Dissipative Systems and Singularly Perturbed PDE's.
