Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of an                 
              image processing system and high-temperature stage for use with a              
              petrographic microscope. The system will be installed and operated             
              in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at the                    
              California Institute of Technology. The Institute is committed to              
              providing matching funds.                                                      
                   The equipment will be used to study and interpret                         
              quantitatively the nucleation and growth of bubbles in silicate                
              melts in a range of chemical compositions corresponding to natural             
              magmas. A quantitative model of bubbling in magmas is an important             
              step leading to an interpretation of the origin of igneous rocks,              
              volcanos, and an understanding of the Earth's mass budget of                   
              critical gases such as H2O and CO2.
