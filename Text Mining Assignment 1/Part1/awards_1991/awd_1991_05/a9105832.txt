Abstract    :
                   This research examines the problem of maximizing the total                
              information transfer when data are transmitted through a series of             
              noisy channels.  This is a common situation in communication                   
              networks.  The key information-theoretic fact is that the overall              
              capacity is strongly dependent on the order in which the individual            
              channels are arranged.  A number of interesting and tractable                  
              problems are formulated and investigated; some counter-intuitive               
              results are suggested and will be evaluated.
