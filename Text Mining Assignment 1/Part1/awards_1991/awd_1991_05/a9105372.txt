Abstract    :
                   The Internet is a powerful resource.  Interconnecting millions            
              of individuals at thousands of institutions worldwide, it offers               
              potential for significant inter-organizational sharing of                      
              resources, such as documents, software, data, network services, and            
              people. The principal investigator (PI) envisions a sophisticated              
              distributed collaboration paradigm where people accomplish tasks               
              and share resources among many interrelated individuals across                 
              administrative borders.                                                        
                   The research in this project will consider three questions:               
              how can one design resource discovery algorithms that scale for use            
              in national or international networks, provide algorithms to                   
              support searches without imposing artificial constraints on the                
              resource space organization, and build systems that require a                  
              minimal level of global administration agreement on protocols,                 
              information formats, and organizational structures.  To answer                 
              these questions, the PI will explore a highly decentralized                    
              architecture for supporting resource discovery.  The research                  
              emphasizes systems and networking issues, involving distribution               
              and replication for registering and maintaining distributed                    
              structures, called "views"; security of view contents; ease of                 
              creating and updating views; and ease of searching for resources.
