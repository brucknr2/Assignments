Abstract    :
              This study will develop and test a model for sublacustrine                     
              eruptions based on evaluation of several volcanoes known to have               
              erupted in relatively deep lakes.  A selected set of volcanoes                 
              erupted into ancient Lake Idaho will be evaluated using the model              
              to test its validity.  Precise field observation is critical.                  
              The PIs will log eruptive successions in detail, and trace-out                 
              lateral relationships on cliffside exposures.  Additional                      
              information will be obtained by standard thin-section                          
              petrography and limited x-ray diffraction and microprobe                       
              analysis.  The study is expected to demonstrate that eruptive                  
              processes analogous to those inferred for Surtseyan volcanoes                  
              control the evolution of volcanoes erupted into deep lakes.
