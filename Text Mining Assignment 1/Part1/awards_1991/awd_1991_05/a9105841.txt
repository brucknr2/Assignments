Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Members of the bacterial genus Frankia enter into a dinitrogen-                
              fixing symbiosis with several non-leguminous plants; one of the                
              unusual aspects of this symbiosis is the presence of hopanoid                  
              lipids in the root nodules.  An aim of this research is to isolate             
              and examine mutants deficient in one or another aspect of hopanoid             
              biosynthesis in order to determine the functional role of these                
              lipids in the symbiosis.  A second aim will be to assess the                   
              influence of hopanoids in establishing the symbiosis.
