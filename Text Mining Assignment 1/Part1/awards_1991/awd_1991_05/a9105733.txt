Abstract    :
                This research is to continue the valuable program to catalog                 
              centroid-moment tensor (CMT) solutions from global digital seismic             
              data on a routine basis.  The Harvard CMT catalog has become a                 
              significant resource for the seismological community in global                 
              tectonic studies.  In addition, research will be done on large deep            
              earthquakes lying away from the most intense seismic activity in               
              Wadati-Benioff zones, and on better methods for parameterizing                 
              source time functions of earthquakes.  These studies are                       
              fundamental to seismological research and the origin and                       
              distribution of earthquakes.  This research is a component of the              
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
