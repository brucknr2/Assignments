Abstract    :
                This research applies an accurate and efficient method for                   
              analyzing cracks in a three-dimensional elastic half-space to the              
              study of slip zones in the earth's crust.  Previous studies are                
              extended to consider the effects of non-uniform stress drop,                   
              segmented faults, and coupling of normal and shear stresses due to             
              near-surface slip and non-planar slip zones and advance of slip                
              zones.  In addition, calculations are done to determine stresses               
              and surface deformations due to the advance of shear faults into               
              and around locked, or more resistant, portions of the shallow                  
              crust.  The goal of these studies is to understand better the                  
              mechanics of earthquake slip and, in particular, conditions that               
              control the initiation and termination of earthquake ruptures.                 
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                 
              Reduction Program.
