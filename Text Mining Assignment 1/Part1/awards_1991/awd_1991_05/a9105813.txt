Abstract    :
              The Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois will                       
              purchase three machines, one high power color graphics                         
              workstation, and two lower-power workstations.  The equipment                  
              will be used for three primary research  projects: (i) Studies of              
              weak turbulence in two model systems,  the Ginzburg-Landau                     
              equation and the Zakharov system; (ii) Control of weakly                       
              turbulent systems using a technique that requires no feedback;                 
              (iii) Forecasting high dimensional chaotic dynamics using a                    
              learning algorithm that discovers predictable regions of a                     
              system's state space.
