Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytech                   
              Institute acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer which will be used                
              in research investigations in the following areas of chemistry:                
              1) proteins (endothelin, alamethicin, gramicidin and                           
              ion-binding sites of lysozyme), 2) drug interactions with model                
              oligonucleotides, 3) self-assembled inorganic double helicates                 
              4) ion channels in cell membranes 5) polyether antibiotics and                 
              6) enantioselective syntheses of organic molecules with                        
              biological activity.  The applications of the ten minor users                  
              include the study of inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis,                   
              glycoside antibiotics, and characterization of the structure                   
              and dynamics of natural and synthetic polymers.                                
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
