Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study some problems in                    
              algebraic geometry related to partial differential equations.                  
              Systems of partial differential equations may be formulated as an              
              integrable system. The solutions of the partial differential                   
              equation are realized as integrable manifolds of the system. It is             
              this formulation of systems of partial differential equations which            
              makes the application of methods from algebraic geometry possible.             
                   Systems of partial differential equations play an important               
              role in models of physical systems. An important example is in the             
              area of control theory in which one would like to guide an object              
              along a desired trajectory. The system of partial differential                 
              equations used to model this situation can be formulated as an                 
              integrable system. The research supported by this award should be              
              particularly useful in studying this problem.
