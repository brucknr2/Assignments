              (HPLC) system is an investigation                                              
              of the stability of monoclonal                                                 
              antibody (MAb) production by                                                   
              hybridomas and quadromas, the                                                  
              fusion product of two hybridomas,                                              
              during long-term continuous culture                                            
              in suspension and immobilized                                                  
              systems.  Using an optimized HPLC

              both parent hybridomas, and the                                                
              quadroma, will be monitored during                                             
              long-term continuous culture.                                                  
              Results will be integrated with                                                
              concurrent flow cytometry and                                                  
              metabolic studies in an effort to                                              
              elucidate mechanisms for improving                                             
              the stability of MAb production by                                             
              hybridomas and quadromas.
