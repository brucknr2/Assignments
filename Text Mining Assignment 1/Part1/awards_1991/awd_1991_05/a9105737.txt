Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cellulose synthesis is a significant activity of the                           
              differentiating cells of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium                 
              discoideum, but the role of cellulose during development and the               
              control of its synthesis have received little attention in the                 
              literature. The objectives of this project are: to determine the               
              rates, sites, and timing of cellulose synthesis; to analyze the                
              cellulose found in each of four distinct extracellular structures              
              to see if there are biophysical differences in the cellulose that              
              can be related to differences in cellular structures or control;               
              to determine if cellulose synthesis is at any time a cell-type                 
              specific process; to describe the interactions between cellulose               
              and extracellular matrix proteins in structuring the stalk tube;               
              to characterize mutant strains that are unable to synthesize                   
              cellulose or are somehow altered in their cellulose synthesis;                 
              and to identify the gene for cellulose synthase and thereby study              
              the molecular control of cellulose synthesis. The results of this              
              project are significant not only for the contribution they will                
              make to our knowledge of D. discoideum development, but also for               
              what they may tell us about the control of cellulose synthesis in              
              plants.
