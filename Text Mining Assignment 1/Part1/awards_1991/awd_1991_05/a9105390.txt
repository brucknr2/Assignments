Abstract    :
                   The polydeformed metasedimentary rocks of northern New England            
              have a complex history of ductile deformation that occurred during             
              the Devonian Acadian Orogeny.  New models for the sequence of                  
              deformations have been proposed, and this                                      
              project will test them using exposures in the Presidential Range               
              of northern New Hampshire where the possible root zone for Acadian             
              thrust-nappes occurs.  The pressures and temperatures during                   
              deformation will be determined and the timing of deformation will              
              be constrained by radiometric age techniques.  Results, in                     
              conjunction with other studies in New England, are expected to                 
              clarify the complex late Paleozoic polydeformations that affected              
              New England.
