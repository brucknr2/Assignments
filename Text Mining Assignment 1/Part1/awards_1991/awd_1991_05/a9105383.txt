Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A central property of living systems is rhythmic periodic                      
              activity, particularly circadian rhythms which are daily cycles.               
              It is not yet clear what mechanisms entrain and regulate the                   
              occurrence and timing of these oscillations.  The primary                      
              environmental signal for circadian rhythms is the change in light              
              intensity associated with dawn and dusk, but the "circadian                    
              photoreceptors" that mediate these responses are still poorly                  
              understood.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This project is pilot work to try to get information on this                   
              mechanism by using a new marking technique that labels pathways                
              in the brain.  This marker will allow visualizing the circuit                  
              that connects the cells that receive the important light stimulus              
              to the cells in the brain that regulate the circadian rhythm.                  
              One particular strain of mutant mice has been found to be missing              
              key cellular elements in the eye, yet still showing a photically               
              driven rhythm.  The pathway in this mutant will be compared to                 
              that in normal mice to clarify how the light information gets to               
              the brain.  If this novel marking technique can be made to work                
              well, the results will be very important to visual science,                    
              chronobiology, and neuroscience in general.
