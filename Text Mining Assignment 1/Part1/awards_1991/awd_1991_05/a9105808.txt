Abstract    :
              DNA primase catalyzes the synthesis of short oligoribonucleotides              
              that DNA polymerase . (pol .) then elongates.  Relatively little               
              is known about how the two enzymes function together.                          
                                                                                             
              The primary goal of these studies is to understand how primase and             
              pol . function together to initiate synthesis of a new DNA strand.             
              Synthetic oligonucleotides of defined sequence will be used to                 
              determine what features in DNA are important for primer synthesis              
              at a given site, and how varying the base composition affects the              
              kinetic parameters.  Isotope trapping experiments will be used to              
              examine DNA binding and the nature of a rate limiting step during              
              primer synthesis.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The role of primase is to synthesize RNA primers that pol . can                
              then elongate.  The structural features of the primase synthesized             
              primers that are important for recognition by pol . will be                    
              determined.  Primer length, the 5'-triphosphate, 3'-terminal                   
              nucleotide and composition (RNA vs DNA) will be examined.                      
              Recognition will be examined both by steady-state kinetic                      
              techniques and by trapping experiments.                                        
                                                                                             
              Pol .: primase likely interacts with a large number of proteins in             
              vivo.  These studies will be extended to examine how auxiliary                 
              proteins that have been implicated in DNA replication affect the               
              catalytic properties of pol .: primase.
