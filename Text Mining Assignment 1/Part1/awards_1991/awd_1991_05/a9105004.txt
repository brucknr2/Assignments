Abstract    :
                This research will investigate the seismic velocity and                      
              reflectivity structure of the Proterozoic lithosphere of the Baltic            
              Shield for comparison with well-studied parts of Phanerozoic                   
              continental lithosphere.  Data are from the near-vertical and wide-            
              angle three-component seismic-reflection BABEL project collected               
              in 1989 by an international consortium.  This work will study a                
              subset of BABEL data that is not being studied in detail by other              
              BABEL investigators.  One objective is to determine whether mid-               
              Proterozoic continental growth, composition and tectonics resemble             
              Phanerozoic on the Baltic Shield.
