Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project supports participation by three                     
              U.S. persons in a workshop on Image Processing to be held                      
              in Pune, India in July 1991.  The host institute is the                        
              Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics.                        
              The U.S. participants include two scientists and one data                      
              processing expert who will present lectures on image                           
              processing associated with observational astrophysics                          
              activities.  These activities have greatly increased in                        
              India with the construction of several telescopes including                    
              the 2.3 meter Vainu Bappu Telescope (VBT).  The areas of                       
              the expertise of the three participants complement each                        
              other.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The IUCAA is the focus of astronomical and                             
              astrophysical research in India.  It is under the                              
              University Grants Commission and is to provide facilities                      
              to all university and other researchers in the field.  It                      
              is likely also to facilitate cooperation with foreign                          
              astronomers, including U.S. scientists.  The support                           
              provided by this project will enable Indian scientists to                      
              improve their observations and to provide better defined                       
              data to the world scientific community.  The project fits                      
              the U.S.-India Cooperative Science Program objectives.
