Abstract    :
                This research is to support data analysis of the 1990 Brooks                 
              Range Seismic Experiment for which field operations support was                
              provided by NSF, IRIS, and the USGS.  The project conducted a                  
              vertical-incidence to wide-angle seismic reflection/refraction                 
              investigation across the Brooks Range and North Slope, Arctic                  
              Alaska extending 315 km from the Ruby terrane at the Arctic Circle,            
              across the eastern edge of the Koyukuk Basin, the Brooks Range                 
              fold-and-thrust belt, and the southern half of the North Slope.                
              A 700-channel seismograph system was used in 6 deployments to                  
              record 63 shots at 44 shot points.  This research is for                       
              conventional and advanced seismic processing and interpretation                
              complementing that done by USGS scientists. Lithologic                         
              interpretations will be done in collaboration with Purdue                      
              University.
