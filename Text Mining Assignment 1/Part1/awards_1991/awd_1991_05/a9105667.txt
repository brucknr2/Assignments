Abstract    :
                   This award will support research in mathematics and material              
              science. In particular, Professor Taylor will investigate the                  
              shapes of surfaces which minimize surface energy subject to                    
              various constraints. The evolution of these surfaces is                        
              determined by the current shape and position of the surface and                
              involves factors such as mobility and surface energy reduction.                
              Surface energies which are so anisotropic that single crystals in              
              equilibrium are polyhedra are of particular interest.                          
                   Professor Taylor will continue to study both the                          
              mathematical and physical theory of crystal growth. She will also              
              continue to develop computer algorithms which will illustrate the              
              mathematical ideas and serve as an experimental tool. The use of               
              computer experiments as an aid in the development of theory is                 
              one of the many unique aspects to the research.
