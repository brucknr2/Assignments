Abstract    :
                 Cell movements such as phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and cytokinesis            
              require precise control of the assembly of actin filaments into                
              either randomly gelled networks or highly polarized bundles.                   
              Formation of these cross-linked actin structures is mediated by                
              actin cross-linking proteins.  This project focuses on the                     
              structure and function of the Dictyostelium 30,000 dalton actin                
              bundling protein, one of seven actin cross-linking proteins present            
              in Dictyostelium.  The binding sites for actin and parameters                  
              controlling the formation of either actin gels or bundles will be              
              investigated.  The biological function of the protein will be                  
              examined through studies of its interaction with plasma membranes,             
              intracellular localization during phagocytosis and cytokinesis, and            
              by using a genetic approach to engineer cells lacking this protein.            
              The structure of similar molecules in Drosophila and mouse will be             
              examined to determine the degree of conservation of this protein               
              during evolution of arthropods and vertebrates.                                
                                                                                             
              This work will promote our understanding of molecular mechanisms               
              of cell movements essential to the growth and division of                      
              eukaryotic cells.
