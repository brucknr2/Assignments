Abstract    :
                   During the past two years, the PI's NSF grant has made it                 
              possible to generate a new collection of computer graphics                     
              programs for the geometry of smooth and polyhedral submanifolds                
              in euclidean 3- and 4-space.  This ongoing work has been the                   
              result of collaborations with undergraduate and graduate                       
              students.  It has been applied in the proposer's research on the               
              geometry of piecewise circular curves and on highly symmetric                  
              combinatorial structures on the complex projective plane.                      
              Preliminary versions of this research program have been used to                
              provide the illustrations for proposer's Scientific American                   
              Library book and several articles, as well as the images used for              
              Mathematics Awareness Week.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The P.I. and his assistants intend to continue the development of              
              this system, and to apply it to extensions of the problems, as                 
              well as other problems in the geometry of submanifolds.  The work              
              of the P.I. has interest to the mathematical Sciences community                
              at large, as well as to mathematics educators.
