Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Glossiphoniid leech embryos, such as those of the species                      
              Helobdella triserialis, are well suited for studying cellular                  
              aspects of early development, because they are relatively large                
              and hardy, and because their blastomeres are both experimentally               
              accessible and individually identifiable. Thus, experimental                   
              analyses can be carried out on developmentally equivalent cells                
              from one embryo to the next. This proposal is to continue                      
              previous analyses of various aspects of leech development,                     
              including: the role of cytoplasmic determinants in determining                 
              early cleavage; the specification of mesodermal and ectodermal                 
              cell lines; fate determining interactions between initially                    
              equipotent cells; the continuing refinement of developmental cell              
              lineages; the influence of a transient embryonic epithelium on                 
              morphogenesis. The experiments proposed will carry out these                   
              analyses at the cellular and molecular level, by incorporating                 
              the techniques of the "reverse genetic approach" in combination                
              with those used previously, such as microinjection of cell                     
              lineage tracers and other materials into identified embryonic                  
              cells, single cell ablation and optical microscopy.
