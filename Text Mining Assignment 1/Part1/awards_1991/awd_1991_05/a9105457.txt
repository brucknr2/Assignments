Abstract    :
                   Surface topography in principle should be perturbed by the                
              passage of a hot spot plume because of the heating and cooling of              
              the lithosphere during passage.  However, geologic record of such              
              topographic response is very sparse.  This project will investigate            
              sediments of Neogene age in southwestern Montana that were                     
              deposited in a paleovalley during the possible passage of the                  
              Yellowstone hot spot.  The work will involve testing for drainage              
              reversals, to attempt to date the deposits and to determine source             
              of the sediments.  Results will provide unusual insight into                   
              topographic changes that may have occurred during the passage of               
              the Yellowstone hot spot across Montana.
