Abstract    :
                   This project will study differential delay equations and                  
              iterations of nonexpansive maps.   Main emphasis will be placed                
              in extending current knowledge to the cases of several delays and              
              of delays depending on the state.  In particular, for equations                
              depending on a small parameter and delays depending on the state,              
              the project will study the boundary layer phenomenon resulting                 
              in periodic solutions when the parameter tends to zero.  Analysis              
              of nonexpansive mappings through generalizations of properties of              
              linear stochastic matrices will be pursued.                                    
                   Models in biology, economics, physics and even other                      
              branches of mathematics motivate the main problems to be studied.              
              The generality of the questions will make the results relevant to              
              most areas of basic science.
