Abstract    :
                   This is a study of numerical studies of three-dimensional                 
              mantle convection.  The model includes lithospheric plates driven              
              by body forces and basal tractions.  The calculations will address             
              a number of important questions bearing on the motion and evolution            
              of lithospheric plates, and how they influence flow in the mantle.             
              Problems include (1) studies of how the toroidal flow introduced               
              by plate motions influences deformation and the rate of mixing in              
              the mantle; (2) multiple plates interact with mantle convection,               
              and the relation between individual plate motions and the                      
              underlying mantle flow; (3) studies of the stress induced in plates            
              by mantle convection, and how changes in the forces on plates                  
              influences their deformation and the formation of new plate                    
              boundaries.
