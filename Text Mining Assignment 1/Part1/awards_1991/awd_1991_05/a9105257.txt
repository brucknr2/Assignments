Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The basic goal of this proposal is to determine the physiological              
              mechanisms that cause individuals of the cricket Gryllus rubens to             
              produce either a high or low amount of the key enzyme juvenile                 
              hormone esterase.  High enzyme concentration causes individuals to             
              develop into a long-winged, dispersing form while low enzyme                   
              concentration causes the development of short-winged, flightless               
              adults.  This research will clarify the mechanisms by which                    
              hormones regulate important developmental processes in insects.                
              Since amount of juvenile hormone esterase produced is genetically              
              determined, this study will be especially important in identifying             
              genetic aspects of the hormonal regulation of development.  In                 
              addition, these high and low-enzyme genotypes of G. rubens are                 
              found naturally in the field.  Thus, this study will also identify             
              how evolution is altering development to produce a new phenotype               
              (short-winged, non-flying form in this case).  This is currently               
              one of the most important but poorly understood aspects of                     
              evolution.  Last, by providing information on the regulation of                
              development, this study will provide important background                      
              information for applied studies that attempt to disrupt development            
              to control insect populations. //
