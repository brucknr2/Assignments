Abstract    :
                   This project will allow Bishop Museum in Honolulu to                      
              conserve and rehouse its mollusk collection in new metal storage               
              cabinets.  This collection (6 million specimens in 240,000 lots,               
              including 900 holotypes and 24,000 other types) is dominated by                
              Pacific land snails, and ranks as the ninth largest mollusk                    
              collection in the U.S.  Two-thirds of the land snail specimens                 
              have associated alcohol-preserved soft parts in the collection.                
              The project follows from a 1987 conservator's report that                      
              recommended 1) replacing all land snail specimen trays with acid-              
              free unit trays and/or polystyrene boxes, 2) replacing all wooden              
              cabinets and drawers with metal fixtures, and 3) removing all                  
              cardboard boxes in and around the storage area.  Temperature and               
              humidity fluctuations have been controlled by the Bishop by                    
              installing several window air conditioning units.  Rehousing of                
              this collection will not only conserve this international                      
              research resource, but will make it much more accessible for                   
              education and research in the biology of mollusks.
