Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Weinberg is studying the transcriptional regulation of two                 
              histone H4 genes which are expressed with different temporal                   
              programs in the sea urchin embryo. The early H4 gene is                        
              transcribed in the cleavage and early blastula stages and is not               
              expressed at gastrula. The particular late H4 gene he is studying              
              is expressed at a low level until mid-blastula when transcription              
              markedly increases. The major goal is to understand the control                
              network involved in the differential regulation of these two                   
              genes. These studies should provide a model for gene regulation                
              at a very early embryonic stage. The sea urchin H4 histone genes               
              have a number of features similar to vertebrate H4 genes and                   
              information gained from the research proposed here should be                   
              relevant to H4 gene regulation in other organisms. Moveover,                   
              there are two aspects of sea urchin EH4 gene expression which are              
              particularly exciting. The first is that a major part of the                   
              developmental control of the gene is negative. Deletions which                 
              include a 10 bp sequence between -150 and -140 result in a                     
              failure to repress transcription at post-blastula stages. One of               
              the goals of the proposal is to understand this mode of EH4 gene               
              control. A second feature which is of special interest is that                 
              the TATA box is required for transcription only if the binding                 
              site for the positive acting factor UHF-1 is deleted. Moreover,                
              in an in vivo expression assay, the LH4 TATA box cannot                        
              substitute for the early TATA sequence in a gene lacking the UHF-              
              1 site. One of the goals is to investigate how UHF-1, TFIID, and               
              an initiator element are involved in the initiation of                         
              transcription. The general strategy of these experiments is to                 
              identify sequence elements and test arrangements of the elements               
              by transcription in nuclear extracts or by using an in vivo                    
              expression assay in which genes are injected into fertilized eggs              
              of another sea urchin species.
