Abstract    :
              The processes by which plant viral and subviral RNAs                           
              replicate and produce disease symptoms are not understood.                     
              One particularly intriguing question concerns the origin of                    
              linear subviral RNA multimers.  A proposed model suggests                      
              that multimers are formed by the same process as the                           
              generation of discontinuous RNAs in the same system; the                       
              replicase reinitiates synthesis before releasing the newly                     
              synthesized strand.  This model will be tested by following                    
              the formation of multimers and monomers in a protoplast                        
              replication system as well as analyzing different satellite                    
              RNA mutations which affect the ratio of monomers and                           
              multimers produced in vivo.  A second question involves the                    
              recent finding that reiterative copying of redundant                           
              nucleotide can occur under specific circumstances in a                         
              subviral RNA accumulating in plants.  In certain animal                        
              viruses, this process, known as replicase stuttering, results                  
              in the exposure of cryptic reading frames.  A model involving                  
              a stable stem loop structure in the region of the nucleotide                   
              additions will be tested using deletion analysis and in vitro                  
              mutagenesis techniques.  The possibility of a physiological                    
              role for reiterative nucleotide copying will be addressed by                   
              transferring a "stuttering cassette" to a heterologous viral                   
              RNA and testing for the ability to insert additional, non-                     
              encoded nucleotides. //
