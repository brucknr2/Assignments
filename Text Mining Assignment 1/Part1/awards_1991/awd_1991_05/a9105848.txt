Abstract    :
                   This award provides for two-thirds of the funds required to               
              acquire a Kappabridge magnetometer,reputed to be the most                      
              sensitive, off-the-shelf system for measuring anisotropy of                    
              magnetic susceptibility (AMS) over short time periods (minutes).               
              The university is committed to provide the additional funds to make            
              this acquisition possible. The instrument will be used by the PI               
              and his students in a study designed to test the effect of                     
              progressive metamorphism on the development of AMS in rocks                    
              containing paramagnetic minerals and essentially no ferromagnetic              
              minerals.                                                                      
                   Certain types of AMS data are reported to be helpful in                   
              interpreting the strain state and strain history of deformed                   
              rocks.This kind of information is necessary to reconstruct the                 
              nature and magnitude of orogenic (mountain building) processes.                
                   Several other faculty and students from nearby colleges and               
              universities also intend to use this instrument.
