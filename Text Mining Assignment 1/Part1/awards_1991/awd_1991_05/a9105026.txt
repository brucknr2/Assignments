Abstract    :
                   The pacific northwest consists of several allochthonous                   
              terranes that were joined to North America during the Mesozoic and             
              Tertiary.  The Coast Plutonic Complex, an 1800 km-long belt of                 
              metamorphic and plutonic rocks obscures the contact between two                
              extensive and probably far-traveled crustal fragments, the                     
              Intermontane and Insular superterranes.  Models for the accretion              
              of the western fragment depend on a clear understanding of the                 
              structural evolution of the Coast Plutonic Complex, yet the age and            
              style of deformation are poorly known.  This project will address              
              these issues by a detailed structural and metamorphic investigation            
              of these rocks near Bella Coola, British Columbia.  Results are                
              important to understanding of the tectonics of terrane accretion.
