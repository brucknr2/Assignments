Abstract    :
              This study proposes analysis, using ion microprobe and                         
              conventional mass spectrometric techniques, of three important                 
              constituents of the ore paragenesis of the Viburnum Trend:  1)                 
              The "Octahedral" and "Cubic" stages of galena, including the                   
              more complex textures which occur in addition to the simple                    
              forms.  (Pb and S isotopes will both be determined by ion                      
              microprobe.)  2)  Other major sulfide phases, including pyrite,                
              marcasite and chalcopyrite.  (Pb and S isotopes by ion                         
              microprobe; Pb supplemented by conventional MS.)  3)                           
              Hydrothermal dolomite.  (Pb isotopes in distinct                               
              cathodoluminescent zones and intrazonal bands by conventional                  
              MS.)  This work will include late-stage calcite.                               
              This study is designed to provide critical information about:  1)              
              the source of the Pb and S which formed the Viburnum Trend ores                
              and, as a consequence, 2) the number of identifiable fluid                     
              sources which contributed to the formation of the ores, and, 3)                
              the mechanism(s) which precipitated the sulfide ores.
