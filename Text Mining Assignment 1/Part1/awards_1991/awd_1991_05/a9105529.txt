Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Chemistry Department at Northern Arizona University in                     
              conjunction with faculty in Physics and Anthropology seeks to                  
              acquire an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectrometer for                    
              research purposes.  The objectives are to increase Native                      
              American participation in chemistry/physics research and to                    
              introduce advanced analytical techniques to faculty and                        
              Native American students interested in the archaeology of the                  
              Southwest.  The proposed research is designed to:  1) Explore                  
              host-guest inclusion chemistry using a variety of                              
              paramagnetic organic radicals and hosts such as cyclodextrins                  
              and cyclophanes; 2) Study the migration and speciation of                      
              paramagnetic metal ions in clays; 3) Study the detection of                    
              organic and inorganic species in coprolites and the                            
              determination of the thermal histories of food grains; 4)                      
              Investigate the concentration and properties of polarons in                    
              conducting polymers; and 5) Investigate Si surfaces, under                     
              high vacuum, and explore the behavior of these surfaces when                   
              coated with a variety of metals.
