Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial support for the operation and                 
              maintenance of Pynion Flat Observatory (PFO) in southern                       
              California. PFO is operated by staff at the University of                      
              California at San Diego for the purpose of developing, testing, and            
              calibrating instruments for measuring long-term crustal deformation            
              and seismic activity. The facility is used by numerous researchers             
              from various U.S. and international academic research institutions             
              as well as by investigators from several U.S. federal agencies such            
              as the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Aeronautics and Space              
              Agency, and the National Geodetic Survey (NOAA).
