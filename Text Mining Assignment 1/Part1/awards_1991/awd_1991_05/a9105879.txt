Abstract    :
                   Paleomagnetic data is an important resource for tectonic                  
              reconstructions of continental fragments, however these data are               
              commonly overprinted or otherwise altered in areas of deformation.             
              This project will investigate the effects of tectonic strain on                
              remanence in an area around the Pennsylvania salient to determine              
              if grain-scale deformation has rotated the remanence declination               
              so that it appears as if oroclinal bending of the fold belt had                
              occurred.  If grain-scale effects can be documented and the                    
              mechanisms of magnetic response understood, the utility of                     
              paleomagnetic data from deformed rocks will be enhanced.
