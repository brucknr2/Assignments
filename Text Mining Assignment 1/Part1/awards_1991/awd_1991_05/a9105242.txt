Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of                    
              computing equipment for the C.F. Richter Seismological Laboratory              
              at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The University is                 
              committed to providing matching funds. The equipment will be                   
              installed in the Applied Science Building and will complement and              
              upgrade the existing computing facilities of the Institute of                  
              Tectonics and the Earth Science Board at UC-Santa Cruz.                        
                   The equipment will be used in research aimed at improved                  
              imaging of internal structure of the Earth by seismic wave analysis            
              and the study of the physics of earthquake faulting.
