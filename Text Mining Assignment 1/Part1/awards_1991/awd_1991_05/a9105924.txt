Abstract    :
                   The role of fluids in the structural and thermal evolution of             
              large-scale crustal extension is not fully understood.  This                   
              project will examine possible fluid-related thermal variations and             
              the depth to which meteoric waters can penetrate in such systems.              
              The research approach is to study the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic             
              characteristics of fluid-rock interactions in a well-studied                   
              Cordilleran metamorphic core complex (Whipple Mountains of                     
              southeastern California).  Results will be applicable to thermal               
              and tectonic models for extensional tectonic regimes.
