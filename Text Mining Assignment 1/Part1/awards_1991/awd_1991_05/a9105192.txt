Abstract    :
              The research activity in this project will utilize concepts of                 
              linear matrix algebra to design fast computational algorithms for              
              signal processing.                                                             
                                                                                             
              In the last decade, concepts from linear matrix algebra have                   
              acquired a central position in the development of signal                       
              processing algorithms.  The solution to many practical signal                  
              processing problems can be obtained in terms of ranks of certain               
              matrices and corresponding subspaces.  In fact, the importance of              
              subspaces in signal processing is motivation for developing tools              
              from the algebra of subspaces, multilinear algebra.                            
                                                                                             
              Some important application areas for linear and multilinear                    
              algebra include direction of arrival estimation, frequency                     
              estimation, signal detection, seismic and geological exploration,              
              dynamic analysis of structures, biomedical signal processing,                  
              system identification, chemistry and economics.
