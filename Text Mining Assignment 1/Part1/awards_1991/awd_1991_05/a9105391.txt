Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will experimentally and theoretically              
              investigate cation and anion distributions in minerals, primarily              
              using X-ray and neutron diffraction techniques.  They also will                
              compile a large computer data base of mineral crystal structure                
              determinations, and in turn use the data base to generate X-ray                
              powder diffraction patterns for the same minerals.  The results of             
              these efforts will provide basic data that is of interest to many              
              earth scientists, especially mineralogists and petrologists, as                
              well as to investigators in other disciplinary areas such as                   
              materials science.
