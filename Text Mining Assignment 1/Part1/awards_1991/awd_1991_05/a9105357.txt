Abstract    :
              The principal investigator has used a laser microprobe, linked with            
              a highly sensitive mass spectrometer, to do unique chemical                    
              analyses on fluid inclusions. He will expand the scope of his                  
              studies to include noble gases and halogens in studying fluid                  
              inclusions in mineralized porphyry copper deposits and in high-                
              grade metamorphic rocks. He will also investigate nucleogenic noble            
              gas isotopes in unirradiated splits of the same samples. This work             
              will be especially important in the development of new analytical              
              techniques which may eventually be applied to many other geologic              
              studies.
