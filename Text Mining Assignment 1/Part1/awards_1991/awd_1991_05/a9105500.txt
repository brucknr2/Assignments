Abstract    :
                This research deals with fractals and the fractal dimension of               
              self-similar fracture patterns observed in the crust, and the                  
              loading conditions under which they were formed.  Three known                  
              loading conditions that have different fractal dimensions are                  
              shear-deformed granular material, sequential-growth fractures, and             
              shock-loaded fractures.  This research will extend the analysis by             
              investigating fault-deformed rock from the San Andreas fault,                  
              shocked materials from laboratory work, and other laboratory and               
              computer simulation experiments.  Fractal dimension relates to the             
              relative frequency of large versus small fractures and may bear on             
              estimations of earthquake frequency of occurrence.  This research              
              is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
