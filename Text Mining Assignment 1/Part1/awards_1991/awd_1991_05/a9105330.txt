Abstract    :
              Viable cell density is one of the                                              
              most important parameters in                                                   
              fermentation processes.  Many                                                  
              indirect methods of determining                                                
              cell density have been introduced                                              
              in the past.  However, these                                                   
              methods suffer for non-specificity.                                            
              A sensor is proposed for rapid and                                             
              explicit measurement of viable cell                                            
              number density in culture media.                                               
              In the proposed method, viable                                                 
              cells are distinguished from other                                             
              inert particles by using the                                                   
              characteristics of living cells.                                               
              The speed in measurement is                                                    
              achieved by fast counting.  The                                                
              sensor is usable in single cultures                                            
              without calibration.  Off-line as                                              
              well as on-line sensors are to be                                              
              constructed.
