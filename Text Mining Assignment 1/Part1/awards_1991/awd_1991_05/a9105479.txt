Abstract    :
                   Detritus shed from a collisional orogen potentially originates            
              from both continental blocks involved and materials formed during              
              the collision.  This project will apply that concept to the                    
              Ouachita-Marathon system that formed during Paleozoic time and will            
              attempt to characterize the sources for the thick sedimentary units            
              present.  The sediments will be assigned to North American sources             
              or an inferred tectonic land (Llanoria) lying south of the north               
              American continent, based on chemical (REE, Cr, Ni, Hf, Ta, Zr) and            
              isotopic (Nd-Sr) data.  Results should help understand sediment                
              sources and dispersal patterns as well as help define and                      
              characterized the southern inferred continental block of this                  
              origin.
