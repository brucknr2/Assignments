Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study phase equilibria as a                   
              function of pressure, temperature, oxygen fugacity, and water                  
              fugacity for silicate magmas ranging in composition from basaltic              
              to dacitic and coexisting with a carbon-oxygen-hydrogen system                 
              fluid. The results will give geologists information about the                  
              origin and evolution of magmas in the Earth's lithosphere.
