Abstract    :
              The project goals of this research proposal are:                               
              1) to clone and sequence the cDNAs for the two subunits of                     
              wheat germ eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4F (p220 and                     
              p26) and the two subunits of its isozyme form, eIF-(iso)4F                     
              (p82 and p28).                                                                 
              2) to identify the m7G cap binding site of p26 and p28 by                      
              comparing the sequences of these polypeptides to each other                    
              an to m7G cap binding proteins from other cells (yeast,                        
              mouse, human).  In addition, a comparison of the sequences of                  
              p220 and p82 will be made in an effort to identify the ATP                     
              binding site, mRNA binding and RNA helicase domains of these                   
              peptides.                                                                      
              3) to clone an sequence the cDNAs for eIF-4A and eIF-4B, to                    
              compare these sequences to those of obtained from other                        
              eukaryotic cells, and to attempt to identify functional                        
              domains.                                                                       
              4) to use the wheat cDNA clones to determine the number,                       
              location and sequence of the genes in Arabidopsis for eIF-4A,                  
              eIF-4B and the subunits of eIF-4F and eIF-iso)4F.                              
              5) to use the wheat cDNA clones for eIF-4A, eIF-4B and the                     
              subunits of eIF-4F and eIF-(iso)4F to determine the level of                   
              expression of these genes during various stages of plant                       
              development.                                                                   
              To achieve these goals, various methods to screen a wheat                      
              cDNA expression library will be used.  Antibodies to the                       
              initiation factors are available, as well as some knowledge                    
              of peptide sequences which will be used to design                              
              oligonucleotide probes.  DNA sequencing, Southern and                          
              Northern blot analysis and quantitation of mRNA will be                        
              carried out by established techniques.  It is not known what                   
              structural features of eIF-4A, eIF-4B and eIF-4F are                           
              important for their function.  Completion of these goals will                  
              provide valuable information with regard to the structural                     
              features of these polypeptides that are important for the                      
              recognition of the 5' m7G cap of mRNA, for binding to mRNA,                    
              for ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity and for binding of                     
              mRNA to ribosomes.
