Abstract    :
                This research will analyze earthquake data collected on portable             
              seismometers during the APT89 experiment along a line from the                 
              Wyoming craton to the Western Superior Province of the Canadian                
              Shield (Western Ontario).  Shear-wave splitting will be used to                
              investigate anisotropy, travel times of body waves will be mapped,             
              and phase interaction with boundaries such as the Moho and core-               
              mantle interface will be used to map lateral variations.  Spanning             
              two major geologic boundaries, the experiment was designed to study            
              the seismological properties of the crust, upper mantle and core-              
              mantle boundary along the traverse.
