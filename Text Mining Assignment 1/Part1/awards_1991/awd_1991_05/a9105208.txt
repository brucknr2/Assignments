Abstract    :
              The research described in this proposal is focused on                          
              theoretical and computational studies of photophysical                         
              processes in proteins.  These studies will include simulations                 
              of time resolved fluorescence spectra of chromophores in                       
              solution and in proteins.  Two kinds of chromophoric systems                   
              have been chosen for study: (1) naturally occurring                            
              indole/tryptophanyl chromophores in water and in protein (e.g.                 
              T4 phase lysozyme), and (2) synthetic fluorescent chromophores                 
              attached to protein (e.g. apomyoglobin).  The proposed project                 
              involves a close collaboration between laboratories with                       
              complementary expertise in respectively, molecular electronic                  
              structure theory and computer simulations of proteins and                      
              liquids, and contains the following objectives: (1) to develop                 
              appropriate potential energy functions for selected                            
              chromophores to be used in simulations of optical excitation                   
              processes in solution and in protein; (2) to characterize the                  
              dielectric response of a protein to a sudden charge                            
              redistribution; (3) to use simulations to distinguish between                  
              alternative molecular relaxation mechanisms which may account                  
              for the picosecond time evolution of the red shift in                          
              fluorescence spectra of tryptophan residues in proteins; (4)                   
              to explore the sensitivity of the "medium" (water, organic                     
              solvent, protein) response to the optical excitation of model                  
              chromophores as a function of basic molecular properties                       
              of the chromophore.
