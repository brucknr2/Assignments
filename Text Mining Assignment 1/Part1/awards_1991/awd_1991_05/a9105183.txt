Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor L. Ein to work              
              in algebraic geometry.  Professor Ein will study vector bundles and            
              syzygies of algebraic varieties.  He wishes to study the                       
              relationship between vector bundles, vanishing theorems and                    
              syzygies.                                                                      
                   This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics.  Originally, it treated                
              figures defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely              
              polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra,             
              but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is                      
              extensively used in those fields.  Moreover, it has proved itself              
              useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer                   
              science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
