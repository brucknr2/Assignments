              Physico-Technical Institute, Leningrad, are organizing a                       
              workshop on paleoastrophysics to discuss origin of                             
              cosmic rays and periodicities in their intensities as                          
              well as relationships between cosmic-ray intensity and                         
              climate.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This workshop will be an intense introduction to a long                        
              term collaborative project between the two institutions.                       
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary                             
              efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual                             
              interest and competence in the field of basic scientific                       
              research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and                            
              mutuality of benefit.
