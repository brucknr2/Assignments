Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The intestine and urinary bladder of vertebrate animals serve an               
              important barrier function controlling the movement of nutrients,              
              salts and water into and out of the organism.  The major objective             
              of the proposed project is to determine the specific mechanisms by             
              which such substances pass across these tissues and the pathways               
              for control of these processes.  The individual membrane proteins              
              which mediate the movement of ions, specifically, can be studied               
              in their ensemble behavior using conventional electrophysiological             
              techniques (and the results related to the overall macroscopoic                
              functioning of the tissue in homeostatic balance of the animal) or             
              studied individually using patch clamp technique (and the results              
              related to the biophysics of membrane ion channel function).  These            
              techniques will be applied to delineate the roles of hormones and              
              drugs in altering membrane transport and to increase understanding             
              of the role(s) of these tissues in salt and water balance.  //
