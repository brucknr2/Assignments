Abstract    :
                   The history of Great Plains climate and the responses of the              
              physical and biologic systems to climate changes in the last 10,000            
              yrs. need to be well understood if we are to make accurate                     
              predictions of the consequences of global warming for this region.             
              Several global climate models have projected the Great Plains as               
              the most likely region in the U.S. to experience prolonged drought             
              conditions in the next decades.  In this light, the chronology and             
              paleoclimatic interpretations of sand dune formation and activity              
              in the now-stabilized dunes which occupy some 50,000 km  of west-              
              central Nebraska--the Nebraska Sand Hills-- take on considerable               
              importance.  Although some workers believe that the major period               
              of dune activity coincided with the maximum advance of continental             
              glaciers (about 18,000 years ago) and the most of the dunes have               
              been stable since that time, evidence is accumulating that much of             
              the dune field, although possibly formed during the Ice Age, has               
              been remobilized several times in the last 10,000 years.  The                  
              organic-rich lake or marsh sediments that formed between stabilized            
              dunes can be radiocarbon-dated.  If only one or two samples from               
              a single interdune area are dated, the history of deposition                   
              appears simple.  Additional dated samples may show that the filling            
              interdune swales was episodic, not gradual; gaps in the record                 
              should coincide with periods of moving dunes.  Many more                       
              radiocarbon dates from strategically-located core and drill holes              
              across interdunes and dunes to settle the controversy surrounding              
              the history of the Sand Hills.
