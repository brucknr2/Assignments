Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project studies the covalent modification of proteins by lipid            
              moieties (the newly recognized modification by long chain--15 and              
              20 carbon--prenyl groups) that promote the interaction of proteins             
              with cell membranes; the overall aim is to understand the molecular            
              mechanisms involved in this prenylation and the roles that such                
              modifications play in the targeting and activity of the modified               
              proteins.  Biochemical and molecular biological methods will be                
              employed in pursuit of three aims:  purification and                           
              characterization of the "GG transferase", cDNA cloning of the                  
              transferase, and immunologic analysis of this transferase, as these            
              relate to mammalian proteins and membranes.
