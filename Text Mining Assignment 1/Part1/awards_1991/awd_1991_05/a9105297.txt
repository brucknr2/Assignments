Abstract    :
                   The impact explanation for the Cretaceous-Tertiary (KT)                   
              boundary mass extinction has received much support and                         
              confirmation, although it continues to be challenged.  As part of              
              the ongoing study of this problem by many scientists worldwide, two            
              lines of investigation are proposed:  (1) detailed stratigraphic               
              study of the sequence of events during the boundary crisis, and (2)            
              search for an impact crater on oceanic crust by studying possible              
              tsunami effects on continental slopes and margins.                             
                   (1) The stratigraphic study will use numerous Apennine KT                 
              boundary sections deposited near the CCD, which are sensitive to               
              paleoceanographic changes.  Recent work shows that abnormal                    
              reducing and corrosive conditions resulted from the KT event in                
              this environment, and the character and duration of these events,              
              and their relation to fluctuations in the iridium profile and the              
              occurrence of impact signatures will be examined.                              
                   (2) Recent work by others strongly suggests impact in the                 
              Southern U.S. -Caribbean-Gulf of Mexico area.  Work on sections                
              proximal to the impact site will yield detailed understanding of               
              the impact event.
