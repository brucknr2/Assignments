Abstract    :
              This project seeks to expand upon our knowledge of the                         
              structure, function and chemical reactivity of biological iron-                
              sulfur (FeS) clusters, the most ubiquitous electron carriers                   
              in nature.  Dr. Adams is investigating the structure and                       
              properties of a new type of FeS center, termed the H cluster,                  
              found at the catalytic site of hydrogenase.  This enzyme has                   
              the unique ability to catalyze H2 oxidation and H2 production,                 
              reactions of fundamental chemical and biological significance.                 
              In two hydrogenases from the anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium                  
              pasteurianum, he has shown that the novel H cluster is                         
              comprised of four to six Fe atoms and has two nitrogenous                      
              ligands, one of which is displaced when the cluster covalently                 
              binds CO, a potent inhibitor.  Further potentiometric,                         
              spectroscopic and crystallographic analyses of these enzymes                   
              are proposed.  He will also investigate the biochemical and                    
              spectroscopic properties of an extremely thermophilic version                  
              of the H cluster in a tungsten-dependent FeS-Hydrogenase that                  
              has been purified from Thermotoga maritima, a unique                           
              eubacterium that grows at 90C.  He has show that spectroscopic                 
              properties similar to those of the hydrogenase H cluster are                   
              exhibited by the novel FeS cluster of an exceptionally                         
              thermostable Ferredoxin from Pyrococcus furiosus, an                           
              archaebacterium that grows optimally at 100C.  Further                         
              modification of this FeS center will be explored as a potential                
              model for the H2-activating H cluster of the hydrogenases.
