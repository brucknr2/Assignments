Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This work will provide a coherent data set consisting of                  
              bathymetry, geophysics, petrology, and hydrothermal activity for a             
              substantial length of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge affected by the Azores            
              hotspot. The overall aim to find the links among the diverse types             
              of data in order to contribute to maore comprehensive models of                
              ocean crust formation. Petrologic sampling of a diversity of                   
              segment types will reveal the scale of petrological segmentation of            
              the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the relationships between petrological                 
              variations and segment type, and provide data to test geophysical              
              models of the organization and mechanism of melt segreation and                
              supply to the crust. Also sufficient sampling to define the                    
              fractionation trends for individual segments and to investigate the            
              relationship between major and trace element variations should                 
              reveal far more about the nature of the Azores hotspot.                        
              Hydrothermal studies are designed to inventory as completely as                
              possible the amount of geothermal mass and heat stored over this               
              redge section, and to establish the number and location of any                 
              hydrothermally active areas on this section of the ridge.
