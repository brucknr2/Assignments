Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Arabidopsis thaliana floral homeotic gene, AGAMOUS (AG), and               
              six additional genes, AGL1-AGL6, have been isolated. Their                     
              sequences share striking similarity with the DNA binding domain                
              of transcription factors from humans (SRF) and yeast (MCM1),                   
              which regulate the expression of the human proto-oncogene c-fos                
              and yeast mating type specific genes, respectively. AG and five                
              of the AGLs are expressed preferentially in flowers, while AGL3                
              is expressed both in flowers and in vegetative tissues. Dr. Ma                 
              proposes to dissect the functional domains of AG using mutational              
              analysis, promoter fusions, and domain switching. Furthermore, he              
              proposes to characterize the structure and expression of the AGL3              
              gene, which has a unique expression pattern among these seven                  
              genes, and may play a more fundamental role in both reproductive               
              and vegetative tissues. Finally, because the yeast MCM1 gene has               
              the same type of DNA binding domain, and because powerful genetic              
              and molecular tools are available in yeast, he proposes to study               
              some functional aspects of the AG protein in yeast. The                        
              combination of these methods in both plant and yeast will lead to              
              a better understanding of the function of these plant genes.
