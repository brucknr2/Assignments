Abstract    :
                   Determining fault-movement chronology is of fundamental                   
              importance in several fields, however dating of movements is                   
              normally accomplished indirectly by cross-cutting relationships.               
              These commonly have large ranges, and a direct dating technique                
              would be widely useful.  This project will attempt to develop and              
              test a method that relies on the formation of fault products such              
              as submicron illite from clay gouge, pseudotachylite and                       
              ultracataclasite that can be dated by K-Ar techniques.  The                    
              Catalina detachment fault in southeastern Arizona will be utilized             
              in these efforts.  Results if successful, will be of widespread                
              interest and utility.
