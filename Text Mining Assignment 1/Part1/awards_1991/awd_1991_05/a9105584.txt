Abstract    :
              This is an award to the Semiconductor Research                                 
              Corporation (SRC) which is a cooperative effort of                             
              U.S. companies and government agencies to                                      
              strengthen and maintain the vitality and competitive                           
              ability of the U.S. semiconductor industry.                                    
              It's two-fold mission is (1) to identify the scientific                        
              and technology needs of the U.S. semiconductor                                 
              industry and to develop and implement a long-                                  
              range strategy for meeting these needs; and (2) to                             
              enhance the skilled manpower base of the industry.                             
              These goals ar realized through an integrated                                  
              program of basic research conducted by faculty and                             
              graduate students at leading U.S. universities.                                
              Since 1982, the SRC has committed more than $150                               
              million to this mission and now supports more than                             
              one-half of all the silicon-related generic research                           
              being carried out at U.S. universities.                                        
              The intent of this grant is to establish a new, three-                         
              year Memorandum of Understanding between the                                   
              SRC and the United States Government, as                                       
              represented by the National Science Foundation,                                
              which will provide the framework for continued                                 
              Government participation.
