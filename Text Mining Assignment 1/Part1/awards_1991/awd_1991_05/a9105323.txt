Abstract    :
              We propose to develop an instrument for x-ray magnetic circular                
              dichroism experiments on paramagnetic samples of bioinorganic                  
              interest.  It will record fluorescence-detected x-ray absorption               
              spectra (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)                     
              measurements.  The device will be optimized for the vanadium                   
              through copper L-edges (500-1000 eV).  Preliminary experiments                 
              will be conducted on paramagentic V, Mn, Fe, Cu and Mo model                   
              compounds with known molecular structure and magnetic properties.              
              Crystallographically characterized small proteins such as azurin               
              and various ferrodoxins will also be examined.                                 
                                                                                             
              The x-ray sources and monochromators for this project are                      
              provided by national synchrotron radiation laboratories (NSLS and              
              SSRL).  Ultimately, the instrument will be used at the Advanced                
              Light Source, a new high brightness soft x-ray ring under                      
              construction in Berkeley.
