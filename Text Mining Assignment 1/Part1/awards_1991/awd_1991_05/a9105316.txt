Abstract    :
              This award enables the Principal Investigator to work with several             
              researchers in the Palo Alto area, including John Mitchell at                  
              Stanford, Luca Cardelli and others at the Digital Equipment Research           
              Center, Walter Hill at Hewlett Packard Laboratories and William Cook           
              at Apple Computer.  The intent is to initiate and pursue new research          
              activities revolving around the design and semantics of object-                
              oriented languages.  The activity is expected to have a significant            
              impact on the author's research at Williams College and on his role in         
              the honors program there.
