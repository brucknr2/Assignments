Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              Wisconsin at Madison acquire upgrades to their single crystal                  
              x-ray diffractometers and computer.  Among the areas of                        
              chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are                 
              the following:  Mechanistic Organometallic Chemistry, Silicon                  
              Chemistry, Small-to-Giant Transition Metal Clusters, Radical                   
              Cation and Electron Transfer Chemistry and Organic                             
              Photochemistry.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Single crystal x-ray crystallography coupled with a computer                   
              system is the most powerful analytical method for structure                    
              determination of solids.  In synthetic inorganic, organic,                     
              bioorganic and organometallic chemistry, single x-ray                          
              diffraction is an invaluable tool for characterizing molecular                 
              structure.  The information gained from the knowledge of the                   
              molecular composition and structure helps to develop new                       
              reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis or                      
              synthesis.
