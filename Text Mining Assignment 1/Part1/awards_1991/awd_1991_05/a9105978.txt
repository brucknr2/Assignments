Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a cooperative program involving the U.S. Geological               
              Survey and Russian scientists from the Institute of Oceanology,                
              Institute of Limnology, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, and               
              Institute of the Earth's Crust.  The program is aimed at developing            
              a detailed structural and stratigraphic history of the Baikal Rift             
              system.  Elements of the program include the processing and                    
              interpretation of multichannel seismic data already collected by               
              Russian colleagues, the collection of new, higher resolution and               
              more accurately navigated MCS data from Lake Baikal, the processing            
              and interpretation of these new data, and the integration of all               
              available data sets into a comprehensive model of continental rift             
              development.  Objectives of the program include:                               
                                                                                             
                   o    Reconstruction of the structural and stratigraphic                   
                        evolution of that portion of the Baikal Rift that                    
                        underlies Lake Baikal;                                               
                                                                                             
                   o    Development of models for the evolution of the lake                  
                        basins; and                                                          
                                                                                             
                   o    Location of appropriate drilling sites that would address            
                        the problems of timing of structural events and shifts               
                        in patterns of deposition, and that would provide the                
                        most continuous sections for studies of climate change               
                        and biologic evolution.
