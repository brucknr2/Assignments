Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Vanderbilt University will                    
              purchase a graphics workstation, which will be dedicated to                    
              support research in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment                  
              will be used for several research projects, including in                       
              particular: A) Modelling of Pressure Preset Ventilation (Philip                
              Crooke), B) Applications of Fractal Interpolation Surfaces to                  
              Computer Graphics and Image Processing (Douglas Hardin), C)                    
              Applications of Splines to Surface Fitting and Image Compression               
              (Larry L. Schumaker). D) Numerical Studies of Invariant Manifolds              
              and Solutions for Monotone Dynamical Systems (Peter Takac), and                
              E) Mathematical Models of Cell Population Dynamics (Glenn Webb).
