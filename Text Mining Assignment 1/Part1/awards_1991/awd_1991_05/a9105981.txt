Abstract    :
              Anisotrophy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is a potentially                  
              powerful indicator of rock fabric (preferred grain orientation)                
              that has not been fully exploited as a tool in volcanology.  This              
              proposal seeks funds for a much more detailed investigation of                 
              AMS fabrics in welded ignimbrites than has been attempted in                   
              previous studies.  Very carefully selected sites will be sampled               
              in order to evaluate the origin and nature of AMS fabrics in                   
              welded tuffs, to map out primary flow directions on the scale of               
              tens to hundreds of meters, to assess the effect that secondary                
              processes (welding and rheomorphism) have on these primary                     
              fabrics, and to assess the degree to which AMS can be used to                  
              constrain mechanisms of deposition from pyroclastic flows.  The                
              Bandelier Tuff, Jemez Mountains, New Mexico will be studied.
