Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will develop laser and ion microprobe               
              techniques for microanalysis of stable isotope ratios. He will                 
              apply these to micron-scale zoning in high grade metamorphic rocks.            
              Principle goals of the study are to document the extent of isotopic            
              zonation in metamorphic rocks and to elucidate the causes of such              
              heterogeneity. Such work will have significant impact on theories              
              regarding the movement of fluid in the Earth's crust, as well as               
              granulite genesis, geothermometry, and cooling/uplift history.
