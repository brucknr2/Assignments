Abstract    :
                   Fine-grained sediments are thought of as barriers to                      
              subsurface fluid flow, but non-marine mudstones in the early                   
              Mesozoic Newark Supergroup of eastern North America contain an                 
              abundance of coarsely crystalline authigenic minerals.  These                  
              mudstones also display depositional cycles on several scales that              
              reflect paleoclimatic fluctuations and provide the means for very              
              precise stratigraphic correlation.  This is a detailed petrographic            
              study of the authigenic minerals in the Newark mudstones on a                  
              regional scale to determine how they vary as a function of                     
              stratigraphic position, as well as other important factors such as             
              geographic location, depositional environment, and proximity to                
              igneous intrusions.  By working closely with a number of other                 
              specialists, particularly Dr. Joseph Smoot of the U.S.G.S. Branch              
              of Sedimentary Processes, we will be able to use a number of                   
              different analytical techniques to attack this problem.  The                   
              results will shed light either on 1) how groundwater varies in the             
              shallow subsurface as a function of long-term climatic fluctuation,            
              or 2) how and why mudstones can served as conduits for late                    
              diagenetic fluid flow.  Either way, they should provide important              
              new insights in a variety of areas, e.g. the formation of sediment-            
              hosted ore deposits.
