Abstract    :
                   Funds will be used for support of a Chapman Conference on                 
              Studying the Earth's Climate Using Continental Isotopic Indicators.            
              As most of our knowledge concerning paleoclimates has been derived             
              from the marine record, there is a paucity of data on variations               
              in continental temperatures and oxygen isotopic composition of                 
              meteoric fluids.  Processes that record the H and O isotopic                   
              composition of meteoric waters and the temperature of formation                
              include, (i) alteration of metastable marine carbonates to                     
              limestones, (ii) precipitation in lakes (carbonates, clays and                 
              phosphorites), (iii) formation of cave deposits, and (iv) formation            
              of organic material.  This workshop will present the current state             
              of knowledge in areas relevant to this concept including; (i)                  
              current variations in the H and O isotopic compositions of the                 
              global meteoric cycle and their relationship to temperature; (ii)              
              the distribution of these deposits through time; (iii) how these               
              deposits reflect the ambient conditions in the modern environment;             
              (iv) problems of interpretation, stratigraphy; and (v) usefulness              
              of such information in constraining global climate models.
