Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at the Pennsylvania State University              
              will purchase a network of workstations that will be dedicated to              
              research in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be                  
              used in several research projects, including in particular:                    
              1. Latent classes, empirical Bayes, and random effects models in               
              categorical data.                                                              
              2. Development and applications of statistical theory to problems              
              in ecology.                                                                    
              3. Inference and curve-fitting in generalization of isotonic                   
              regression.
