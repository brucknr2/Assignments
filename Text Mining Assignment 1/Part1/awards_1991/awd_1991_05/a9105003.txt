Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research plan involves the investigation of a closely                     
              related set of variants of the enzyme Staphylococcal nuclease                  
              (SNase) in complexes with inhibitors and substrates.  These                    
              studies are aimed at determining the details of the structural                 
              and dynamical correlates of the enzymatic reaction.  These                     
              studies will utilize a new type of SNase,  SNase, n which the                  
              solvent accessible and disordered  loop has been deleted.                      
              Preliminary studies suggest that (i) the deletion of the  loop                 
              does not have large structural consequences; (ii) by random                    
              mutation of residues 50 & 51 a series of proteins can be                       
              generated which have continuum of structures and activities;                   
              (iii) the residue at position 43 can be varied in conjunction                  
              with random mutation at positions 50 & 51 to investigate the                   
              structure-function correlates of basic catalysis; (iv) the                     
              comparison of the inhibitor and substrate binding of  loop                     
              containing and sNase could offer important information about                   
              the details of active site interactions and (v) the comparison                 
              of the flexibility of  loop containing and SNAse may offer                     
              information about the role of active site flexibility on the                   
              catalytic reaction.  the major technique to be used in these                   
              studies in NMR.
