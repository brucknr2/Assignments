Abstract    :
                   Recent discoveries in the northern Apennines suggest a                    
              possible link between a large impact and the termination of the                
              latest Triassic (upper Norian or "Rhaetian") Rhaetavicula bivalve              
              fauna.  Preliminary work at three pilot sections in Tuscany and                
              southern Liguria indicates that the occurrence of quartz with                  
              planar features is linked with at least local extinction of the                
              Rhaetavicula assemblage and with major sedimentological changes in             
              carbonate microfacies.  Termination of Triassic foraminiferal                  
              assemblages also seems to coincide with the bivalve extinction and             
              facies changes.                                                                
                   This research will document "Rhaetian" through earliest                   
              Hettangian microfacies and bivalve paleoecology in the northern                
              Apennines.  The goal is a more complete stratigraphic documentation            
              of Triassic-Jurassic sections in Tuscany and southern Liguria, to              
              determine whether the stratigraphic linkage between impact,                    
              termination of faunal elements, and dramatic changes in carbonate              
              microfacies is indeed a regional phenomenon.  This expanded and                
              more complete stratigraphic database on Triassic-Jurassic events               
              in the northern Apennines will permit a more rigorous test of                  
              impact (in particular the Manicouagan impact) as a mechanism for               
              the end-Triassic mass extinction.
