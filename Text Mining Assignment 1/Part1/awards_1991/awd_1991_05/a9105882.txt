Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Even though everyone has planted dry seeds in their garden, or                 
              observed the germination of fungal spores in bread-making, very                
              little is known about how dry biological systems like seeds and                
              spores survive.  Recent work shows that sugars provide protection              
              for membranes as they are dried.  Sugars are abundant in dry seeds             
              and spores.  An additional aspect of the protection of dry systems             
              is the possibility of vitrification--the cytoplasm becomes a highly            
              viscous liquid.  This project will establish the extent to which               
              vitrification contributes to survival desiccation in a variety of              
              organisms.  Model experiments show that complex proteins and                   
              membrane/enzyme complexes can be preserved in the dry state by                 
              providing "vitrifying sugars" before drying.  These studies may                
              lead to methods of preserving genetic products. //
