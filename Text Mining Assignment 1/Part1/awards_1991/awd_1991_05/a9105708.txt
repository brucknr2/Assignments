Abstract    :
              The X chromosome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has three              
              specialized properties: it controls sex determination via the X/A              
              ratio; X-linked genes are subject to dosage compensation; and it is            
              under independent meiotic control.  My previous work has focused on            
              the relationship of sex determination to dosage compensation.  This            
              proposal describes a molecular study of dpy-26, an autosomal gene              
              that affects all three of these properties, to understand how the              
              properties are related.  Two other autosomal genes that affect sex             
              determination and dosage compensation, but not meiosis, will be                
              studied for comparison to dpy-26.  In addition, this proposal                  
              outlines a genetic and molecular analysis of two genes that                    
              specifically affect disjunction and recombination of the X                     
              chromosome, with no effect on the autosomes.  We will use these                
              genes to investigate the relationship among exchange, disjunction,             
              and conversion on the X chromosome.  We will also identify new                 
              mutations that specifically reduce or eliminate recombination on               
              the X chromosome.                                                              
                                                                                             
              In conjunction with the analysis of dpy-26, analysis of these genes            
              will likely contribute to the understanding of both the general                
              mechanisms of meiosis and the chromosome-specific mechanisms of                
              meiosis.***//
