Abstract    :
              This project is to study new xenolith localities recently found                
              in the late Cenozoic Camargo basalt field, and to continue                     
              research on mid-Cenozoic volcanic rocks.  Some of the new sites                
              have crustal xenolith suites containing mafic hornblende                       
              granulites and mafic igneous cumulates, that may represent                     
              different levels of the crust.  The objective is to construct the              
              best constrained model possible for the evolution of continental               
              volcanic rocks.  This model will be based on the volcanic rocks,               
              contemporaneous cumulates, wall rocks, and mantle xenoliths.                   
              This project will test how successful current mathematical models              
              are in reproducing the isotopic, major-element, and trace-element              
              chemistries of the various rock types.
