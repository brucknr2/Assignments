Abstract    :
                   The Acadian tectonic belt of New England records several                  
              pulses of compression from the Ordovician to the carboniferous                 
              before the onset of extension in the Triassic.  The evolution of               
              the Bronson Hill anticlinorium and the Merrimack synclinorium of               
              central Massachusetts has received much work and has been the                  
              cornerstone of understanding the paleozoic compressional orogenies             
              of New England.  Recent advances in single-crystal age                         
              determinations and petrographic microbeam techniques have provided             
              an opportunity to rigorously test previous conclusions and have                
              already provided suggestions of considerable revisions to the                  
              tectonic history of this classic area.  This project will combine              
              the wealth of prior work with the results of new age determinations            
              and quantitative petrology to address several key problems and to              
              integrate the results into a new synthesis of the evolution of the             
              northern Appalachians.
