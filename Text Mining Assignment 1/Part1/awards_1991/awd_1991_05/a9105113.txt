Abstract    :
              This proposal is to study the Sr-Nd-Pb-Th isotopic geochemistry                
              of: (1) volcanics and plutonics from five of the Canary Islands                
              and (2) peridotite xenoliths from Lanzarote, the easternmost                   
              island, and La Palma, the second westernmost island.                           
              Preliminary Sr-Nd-Pb-Th isotope data from the westernmost islands              
              and published data from the eastern islands suggest systematic                 
              variation in isotopic compositions as a function of distance from              
              West Africa.  It may be that these variations reflect interaction              
              of plume melts with the lithospheric mantle, which changes from                
              transitional continental-oceanic in the east (with an enriched                 
              mantle composition) to predominantly oceanic in the west (with a               
              depleted mantle composition).                                                  
              The study has important implications for the location                          
              (lithosphere, asthenosphere, plume) of the various mantle                      
              components, and for the recycling of continental lithosphereic                 
              mantle during rifting.
