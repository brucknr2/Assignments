Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The major goal of this research is to investigate the role of                  
              stimulus-induced intracellular potential changes in the                        
              coordination of plant responses to gravity.  The principal                     
              investigator has shown that gravistimulation induces rapid membrane            
              hyperpolarization along the upper side and depolarization along                
              the lower side of the elongation zone of bean roots.  This                     
              indicates ether that cells in this region detect gravity directly              
              or that there is very rapid signal transmission from the putative              
              gravity-detecting region at the root tip.  These alternatives will             
              be tested by investigating electrical changes in 1) other species,             
              2) roots from which the caps have been removed, and 3) roots of                
              mutants with impaired communication between the cap and the                    
              elongation zone.  These experiments will be coupled with computer-             
              based analysis of growth rate distribution and curvature                       
              development during the response in order to establish a link                   
              between electrical perturbations, signal transmission and growth               
              modifications.  These studies would improve our understanding of               
              the interaction of plants with their environments, and may enhance             
              jour ability of modify or control plant growth.  //
