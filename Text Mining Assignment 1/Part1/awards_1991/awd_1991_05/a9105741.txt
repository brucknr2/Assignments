Abstract    :
                   Subduction zone processes involve considerable changes in                 
              mass, energy and conditions of materials as sea floor is subducted             
              to mantle depths.  The goal of this project is to construct                    
              numerical models incorporating heat transfer, induced mantle                   
              convection, fluid flow paths, and phase equilibria of minerals                 
              undergoing metamorphism.  The model will predict pressure-                     
              temperature-time paths for rocks in the subducting slab and the                
              overlying mantle wedge as a function of the initial thermal                    
              structure, convergence rate, and angle of subduction, duration of              
              subduction and similar parameters.  The model will be tested                   
              against rocks preserved in paleo-subduction zones including the                
              Catalina Schist and Franciscan complex in California and the Japan             
              and Lesser Antilles subduction zones.  Results are expected to                 
              provide improved insight into the processes occurring at depth in              
              subduction zones and the generation of arc magmas.
