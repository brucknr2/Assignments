Abstract    :
                This research is to develop an improved inversion technique for              
              seismic velocity models such as those required in oil exploration              
              and crustal studies.  A problem with current techniques is that an             
              initial guess must be made as to the velocity model; this is then              
              adjusted until it fits the observations.  However, the final result            
              is often dependent on the initial guess.  An inversion method                  
              termed simulated annealing, based on a model of cooling to                     
              crystallization, attempts to avoid having to make an initial                   
              estimate in order to come up with the best final model that fits               
              the seismic data.  A second technique is termed a genetic algorithm            
              based on biological principles of natural selection and genetics.              
              Both are global optimization methods.  If successful, the                      
              techniques will have wide application in seismic oil exploration               
              and crustal investigations.
