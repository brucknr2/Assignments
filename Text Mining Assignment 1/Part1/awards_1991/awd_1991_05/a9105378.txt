Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Reviews of classical embryological studies generally argue that                
              the anterior-posterior axis in the developing nervous system                   
              results from anterior and posterior inducing activities in dorsal              
              mesoderm acting during gastrulation. It is also usually concluded              
              that these regional properties are present in the dorsal mesoderm              
              even before gastrulation commences. Dr. Grainger has found,                    
              however, that the regional inducing capacity of anterior and                   
              posterior mesoderm in Xenopus embryos is not fixed at gastrula                 
              stages, but only at neurula stages, He also finds that regional                
              neuralization in the responding ectoderm is only fixed at the                  
              later stage as well. These results and a critical reevaluation of              
              the literature on neural induction lead him to support a model                 
              differing from the classical view; he suggests that regional                   
              inducing capacity in the mesoderm and the establishment of                     
              anterior-posterior properties in the nervous system are only                   
              gradually acquired during gastrulation. He proposes experiments                
              which will test several aspects of the proposed model and thereby              
              aims to clarify the nature of the tissue interactions leading to               
              regionalization of the nervous system. These studies will provide              
              the information required for future studies of the signalling                  
              systems and gene activities leading to neural regionalization.
