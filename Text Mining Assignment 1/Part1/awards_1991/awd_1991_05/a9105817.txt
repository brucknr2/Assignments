Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will carry out measurements and analysis               
              of chemical tracers, Chlorofluorocarbons, as part of the World                 
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) hydrographic line, P-17S,                  
              which covers a large area of the southeast Pacific Ocean.  These               
              measurements will be used to study the flow of thermocline waters              
              in the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre, formation of Subantarctic               
              Mode Water and Anarctic Intermediate Water, and their spreading                
              properties, as well as other ocean circulation processes.
