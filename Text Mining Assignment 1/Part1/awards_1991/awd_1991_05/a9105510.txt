Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the fundamental and dynamic              
              properties of silicate minerals and glasses as a function of                   
              temperature and pressure, employing various high-pressure,                     
              spectroscopic, and computational techniques. This information                  
              will supply earth scientists with critical information needed to               
              understand physical and chemical behavior of materials deep                    
              within the Earth.
