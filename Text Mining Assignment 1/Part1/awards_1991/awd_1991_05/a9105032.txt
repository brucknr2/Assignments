Abstract    :
              This is a study of the rare gas isotope systematics of residual                
              xenoliths from three islands within the Samoan hotspot chain.                  
              The xenoliths occur in post-erosional volcanics and are                        
              apparently the residual mantle remaining after extraction of the               
              basaltic lava which formed the Samoan shield volcanoes.  Rare                  
              gases (He, Ne, Ar and Xe) will be used to determine the evolution              
              of the mantle source for Samoa and the processes occurring during              
              melt formation and segregation.  Rare gas analysis of individual               
              mineral phases, plus interstitial glass will employ a variety of               
              extraction techniques, including vacuum crushing, fusion by                    
              conventional step-heating, and laser fusion of individual mineral              
              grains.  The Samoan xenoliths are extremely gas-rich, and                      
              accurate He and Ar isotopic analysis can be obtained on single                 
              crystals of < 5 mg.  The study should lead to a better                         
              understanding of the processes involved in the extraction of                   
              volatiles from mantle peridotites during the formation of a                    
              basaltic melt.
