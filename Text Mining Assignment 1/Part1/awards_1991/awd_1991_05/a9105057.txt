Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study an important invariant              
              associated to elliptic operators on manifolds with boundary.  His              
              method will involve calculation of this invariant, the so called               
              eta invariant, of the boundary value problem.                                  
                   The research involved here involves a wide variety of areas               
              of mathematics.  The primary objects of study are partial                      
              differential operators and manifolds.  What is important is the                
              relationship of certain quantities associated with both the                    
              operator and the geometry of the manifold (a manifold is a higher              
              dimensional analog of a surface).  The principal investigator                  
              will concentrate on one such quantity, the eta invariant.
