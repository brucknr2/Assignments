Abstract    :
              A preference-based approach to the problem of leader election in               
              distributed computer systems is examined.  This approach is based upon         
              the observation that a leader in a distributed system should represent         
              a "good" choice for the system from a performance standpoint.                  
              Individual nodes "vote" for different candidate nodes based upon               
              locally available information.  The votes are combined using an                
              election scheme to determine the leader.                                       
                   To develop and test this approach, it is planned to investigate           
              its application to the problem of leader election in two specific              
              system models:  the delay model and the reliability model.  Both,              
              experimental and theoretical, techniques to develop and study                  
              different leader election schemes are used.                                    
                   The preference-based approach is of considerable practical                
              interest and importance.  Voting represents an efficient way by which          
              to use locally available information to make a global decision that            
              reflects the preferences of indididual nodes.  Thus, the preference-           
              based approach is not merely a solution to the problem of leader               
              election; it represents, a generalized framework in which solutions to         
              problems of choice may be developed.
