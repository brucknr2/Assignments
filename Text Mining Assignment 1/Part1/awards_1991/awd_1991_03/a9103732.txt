Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with a variety of problems                     
              in the representation theory of infinite dimensional Lie                       
              algebras.  The principal investigator will work on modular                     
              invariant representations, exceptional hierarchies of soliton                  
              equations, reciprocity laws and infinite-dimensional groups,                   
              classification of graded simple Lie super-algebras of growth                   
              1, and quantum groups.                                                         
                   Many different algebraic objects can be represented as                    
              algebraic sets of transformations of other algebraic objects.                  
              Through these representations their structure can be                           
              determined.  This project is concerned with the representation                 
              theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras.  The study of                     
              these algebras has applications throughout mathematics and                     
              mathematical physics.
