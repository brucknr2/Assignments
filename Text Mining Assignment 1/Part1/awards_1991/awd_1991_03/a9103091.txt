Abstract    :
              This project is for a National Research Council study of Self-                 
              Assembly and Biomolecular Materials.  The project will be co-                  
              funded by the NSF, DOE, and ARO.  Within NSF, the project will be              
              co-funded by the Division of Materials Research, the Chemistry                 
              Division and the Division of Molecular Biology.  An                            
              interdisciplinary group, including physicists, chemists, biologists            
              and engineers will provide a clearer definition of the field; an               
              identification of scientific and technological opportunities;                  
              short-term and long-range research goals; an evaluation of these               
              goals in the context of national needs and broader issues, such as             
              education, interdisciplinary research, institutional cooperation,              
              and international efforts; and recommendations to federal agencies             
              with an interest in supporting this field on optimum strategies for            
              achieving these goals.
