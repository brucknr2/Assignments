Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this project is to provide travel and lodging              
              support for U.S. mathematicians traveling to a conference at Lake              
              Louise, Alberta, Canada, December 12-16, 1991.  The conference is              
              entitled "Algebraic Topology and K-theory", and the intention is               
              to bring together mathematicians from these two, related, but                  
              often separate fields.
