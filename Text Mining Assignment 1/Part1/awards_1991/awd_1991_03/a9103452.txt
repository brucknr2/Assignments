Abstract    :
                   This award will support a graduate student to work with the               
              senior investigator in the area of probability theory called                   
              probability metrics.  The theory of probability metrics deals with             
              the study of distances in the space of probability measures and                
              random elements, interrelations between metrics of different types,            
              the choice of an appropriate metric for a given stochastic                     
              approximation problem, the characterization of induced convergences            
              and uniformities, and applications to limit theorems and stability             
              of stochastic models.                                                          
                   The aim of the investigator's work is to study and develop the            
              theory of probability metrics in a systematic fashion.  The theory             
              of probability metrics seems to have quite a large area of                     
              applications:  limit theorems for sum and maxima of random                     
              elements, characterization of distributions, queueing theory, risk             
              theory, survival analysis, mass transportation, infinite                       
              dimensional network flow problems, and stability of stochastic                 
              models.
