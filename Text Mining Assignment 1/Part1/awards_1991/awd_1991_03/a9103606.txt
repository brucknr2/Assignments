Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This conference on the Biology and Chemistry of Vision is one in               
              a biennial series coordinated by FASEB to increase our                         
              understanding of visual processes.  The theme is on molecular                  
              approaches to studies of visual transduction and retinal                       
              diseases, and the sessions will focus on visual pigments, the                  
              role of photo-stimulated enzymes, adaptation, invertebrate model               
              systems, molecular genetics, retinal cell biology,                             
              hereditary retinal disease, and common motifs in transduction                  
              among other sensory systems.  This conference will promote new                 
              ideas for future investigation, foster collaborations among                    
              interdisciplinary researchers, and provide young investigators an              
              opportunity for enhancing their contacts and exposure in the                   
              field of vision research.
