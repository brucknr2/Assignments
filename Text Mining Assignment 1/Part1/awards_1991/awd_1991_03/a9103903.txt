Abstract    :
                   The Lepidoptera Collection of the Milwaukee Public Museum                 
              (total holdings of 195,000 specimens) has grown significantly over             
              the past decade through acquisition of several significant donated             
              collections.  The Niedhofer Collection (95,000 specimens, 30,000               
              from Brazil) and the Sieker Collection (17,000 Neotropical                     
              specimens), as well as several smaller donated collections, are                
              relatively inaccessible and have not been integrated with the rest             
              of the Department's holdings.  Dr. Allen Young, Curator of the                 
              Collection, proposes to integrate these collections into one                   
              comprehensive resource, and to improve the overall curation of the             
              collection.                                                                    
                   The donated collections represent endangered habitats or areas            
              that have already been developed for human use.  Making these                  
              specimens accessible to scientists would have a significant impact             
              on current research on biodiversity, global climate change,                    
              biogeography, evolutionary biology, ecology, and conservation                  
              biology in tropical regions.  Supporting the growth and improvement            
              of natural history collections such as this are essential for                  
              future generations of biological research.
