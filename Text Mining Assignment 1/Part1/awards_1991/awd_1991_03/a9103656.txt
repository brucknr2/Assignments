Abstract    :
                   This award will support research related travel expenses of               
              four researchers in ergodic theory.  Professors Petersen and                   
              Weirdl are engaged in research in the area of almost everywhere                
              convergence.  Professors Dajani and Hawkins are working on                     
              projects whose aim is to classify non-singular endomorphisms.                  
                   Ergodic theory in general is concerned with understanding                 
              the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated              
              or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail.  This award will              
              allow four researchers to attend conferences and to discuss their              
              work in ergodic theory with colleagues.
