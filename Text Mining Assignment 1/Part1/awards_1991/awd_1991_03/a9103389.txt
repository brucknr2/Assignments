Abstract    :
                   The International School for Space Simulations (ISSS) was                 
              originally conceived as a means of bringing together established               
              and beginning investigators in space plasma physics.  A broader                
              scope was to increase communication in order to advance the use                
              of space plasma simulations by the scientific community as a                   
              whole.  This grant is for support of ISSS-4 which will be held                 
              March 25 - April 6, 1991 in both Kyoto and Nara Japan.  The                    
              conference will consist of two distinct segments.  The first week              
              will be devoted to lectures and exercises on simulation                        
              techniques and will take place in Kyoto.  The second segment will              
              be held in Nara and consist of a symposium for the presentation                
              and discussion of recent research topics and methods related to                
              simulations (e.g. observations, data analysis, model                           
              development).
