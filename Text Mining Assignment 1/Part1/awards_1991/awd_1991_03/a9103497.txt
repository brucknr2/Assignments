Abstract    :
                   The pattern of recent normal faulting in the eastern part of              
              the Basin and Range province indicates that both planar, deep-                 
              cutting normal faults and more shallowly- dipping listric normal               
              faults occur in the central overthrust belt of western Wyoming.                
              The listric variety have previously been thought to not generate               
              large earthquakes, however large fault scarps along two of these               
              faults indicate this may be incorrect.  This project will map the              
              trace of these faults, trench across them and date offset deposits             
              in order to assess the possibility that these faults have produced             
              large earthquakes.  The work will also use these data to help                  
              explain regional fault patterns in the eastern Basin and Range.
