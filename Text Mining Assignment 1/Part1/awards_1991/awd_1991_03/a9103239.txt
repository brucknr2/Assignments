Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study problems in the theory              
              of completely integrable systems and their supersymmetric                      
              extensions as well as problems in the theory of ordinary                       
              differential equations arising from the integral systems. The goal             
              of the research is to determine the algebraic structure of the                 
              infinite dimensional set of solutions to an integrable system and              
              relate this structure to the moduli space of algebraic curves.                 
                   A completely integrable system is a collection of geometric               
              and algebraic data at each point in a space which defines a                    
              collection of surfaces which fill up the space much as the pages in            
              a book fill space. In general the pages or leaves are not flat as              
              they ordinarily would be in a book but curved as they would be if              
              one twisted the book. The way in which the leaves are twisted is               
              described by the data provided by the integrable system. The                   
              surfaces or leaves of the system may be thought of as the solution             
              set of a differential equation with different leaves corresponding             
              to different initial conditions. The principal investigator will               
              attempt to understand the solution spaces by using methods of                  
              algebraic geometry.
