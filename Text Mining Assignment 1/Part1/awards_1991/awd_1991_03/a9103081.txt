Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to design and build a lens optimized for                    
              operation at low voltage in a scanning electron microscope, and                
              to combine the lens, field emission gun, and other components                  
              into a working prototype of a LVSEM instrument that should have                
              size, lost, and performance advantages over existing instruments.              
              The project is undertaken cooperatively with AMRay corporation,                
              where the contribution will take place, and where a successful                 
              prototype could  become the basis for a commercial instrument.                 
              The prototype will be transferred to the 1 MR facility in                      
              Madison.
