Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Medusae are known to be important predators affecting the                      
              structure of marine plankton communities.  Although evidence                   
              indicates medusae may be selective predators, the mechanics of                 
              this process have not been clearly described.                                  
                                                                                             
              The research proposed here will examine the relationship                       
              between propulsion and prey encounter by cruising medusa                       
              predators.  Preliminary observations indicate that fluid flow                  
              and particle entrainment caused by medusa bell motions may                     
              determine encounter rates of mobile medusae with various types                 
              of prey.  This hypothesis will be tested in the laboratory by                  
              quantitatively describing flow patterns around mobile medusae                  
              as well as response patterns of prey species.  Predictions from                
              laboratory work will be compared with prey selection                           
              characteristic of the same medusa species in the field.                        
                                                                                             
              Ultimately, understanding of the mechanics of prey encounter                   
              and selection by medusae will help explain the complex effects                 
              of these predators on the plankton community.
