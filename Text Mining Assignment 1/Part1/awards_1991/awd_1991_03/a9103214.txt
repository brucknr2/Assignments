Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will continue his              
              work on orthogonal polynomials and integrals associated to                     
              Coxeter groups and root systems by means of a parametrized                     
              commutative algebra of differential-difference operators.  In                  
              particular, he will look at the intertwining operator which                    
              relates these algebras for different parameter values.  This                   
              operator is conjectured to be a new type of fractional integral                
              operator supported by a subset of the group algebra.  There is a               
              relationship to Poisson kernels that could lead to explicit                    
              integral forms.                                                                
                   The principal investigator is analyzing orthogonal                        
              polynomials that are associated to Coxeter groups and their root               
              systems, in order to study questions involving differential-                   
              difference operators, kernels of integral operators, and special               
              functions associated with the Laplace operator.  Orthogonal                    
              polynomials arise in an essential way in a number of different                 
              areas, such as numerical analysis, approximation theory and                    
              differential equations.  In this project the principal                         
              investigator will use the algebraic structure associated with                  
              these polynomials to extend our knowledge of the symmetry                      
              properties of the polynomials.
