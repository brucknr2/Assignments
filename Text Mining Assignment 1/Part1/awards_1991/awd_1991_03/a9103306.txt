Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The main purpose of this joint US-USSR workshop,                               
              which is being organized by Dr. Paul Nelson of Texas                           
              A&M University and Dr. T.A. Germogerova of the                                 
              Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of Applied                               
              Mathematics in Moscow, is to encourage leading                                 
              researchers in both countries to identify scientific                           
              priorities for long-term cooperative research in the                           
              area of numerical transport theory.  Ten scientists                            
              from each country will take part in the workshop,                              
              which will be held November 5-9, 1991 in College                               
              Station, Texas.  The United States and the Soviet                              
              Union have the two most active research communities                            
              in this field and they tend to be complementary                                
              because of the Soviets' emphasis on mathematical                               
              approaches and the U.S. reliance on computational                              
              solutions.  It is thus expected that there will be                             
              significant results from this activity.                                        
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of                                 
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                             
              researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to                           
              combine complementary efforts and capabilities in                              
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence in                              
              the field of basic scientific research on the basis                            
              of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
