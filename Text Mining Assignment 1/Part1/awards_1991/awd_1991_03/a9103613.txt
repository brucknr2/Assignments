Abstract    :
                   This project will investigate global properties of solutions              
              to nonlinear hyperbolic equations arising in Mathematical                      
              Physics.  In particular the PIs will consider nonlinear                        
              gravitational waves at large distances, formation of black holes,              
              relation between gravitation and matter, stability of Minkowski                
              space-time, and nonlinear Schrodinger equations in the critical                
              case.                                                                          
                   The problems to be studied arise directly in Classical Field              
              Theory, Continuum Mechanics, and General Relativity; their                     
              solutions will directly impact our basic understanding of matter               
              and the universe.
