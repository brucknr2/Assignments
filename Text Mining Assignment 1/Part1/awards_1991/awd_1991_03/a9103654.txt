Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of bulk organic                
              matter, lipids and selected pigments (chlorophylls a, b and c;                 
              B-cartene; and phaeopigments) will be measured to investigate the              
              sources and cycling of organic matter in slected marine                        
              environments.  Preparative-scale high-performance liquid                       
              chromatographic methods will be used to isolate sufficient                     
              quantities of pure parent pigments for precise and accurate                    
              stable isotope analysis.  Carbon and nitrogen uptake and                       
              biosynthetic utilization cause characteristic kinetic                          
              fractionations that can be used to define the "life histories" of              
              of specific organic pools.  While determinations of bulk organic               
              matter properties are useful, the stable isotopic analysis of                  
              specific marker compounds holds great promise for deconvoluting                
              organic matrices produced by multiple sources and complex                      
              processes.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Field studies will include the characterization of three well-                 
              defined oceanographic settings to evaluate the variability,                    
              utility and limitations of pigment-specific stable isotope                     
              distributions for (1) resolving terrestrial and marine biomass;                
              (2) differentiating organic matter sources in sediments; and (3)               
              determining the relative importance of "new" vs. "recycled"                    
              production in the upper water column. //
