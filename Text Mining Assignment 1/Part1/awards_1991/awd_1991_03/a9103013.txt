Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Observations of the structure of conductivity weighting in the                 
              water column and bottom conductance near Cape Hatteras will                    
              further electromagnetic (EM) studies in strong baroclinic                      
              currents (Gulf Stream).  This proposal includes oceanographic                  
              goals and validation of a suite of previously developed EM                     
              instruments in energetic regimes.
