Abstract    :
              This provides partial support for the activities of the National               
              Research Council's Board on Earth Sciences and Resources.  The                 
              Board coordinates the National Research Council's advice to the                
              federal government in earth science issues, ranging from basic                 
              research through applications, to assistance in policy formulation.            
              Such advice includes (1) identifying and enunciating the                       
              opportunities for advancing basic earth science research and                   
              understanding, (2) applying that information for hazard mitigation             
              and resource utilization, and (3) analyzing the scientific                     
              underpinnings and credibility of earth science information for                 
              resource and other earth science applications and decisions.  The              
              Board's actions address the overall health of the earth science                
              disciplines that are vital to the nation in maintaining and                    
              increasing its capability to make wise use of the Earth and its                
              resources.
