Abstract    :
                   This project supports the establishment of a new                          
              committee on the status of women in computer science which                     
              would operate under the auspices of the Computing Research                     
              Association.  The committee will implement projects to                         
              increase the participation of women in computer science                        
              research.  The goals of the committee are: (1) "to increase                    
              the number of women in all types of research and in the                        
              faculty ranks at universities including both the research                      
              universities and the 4-year teaching colleges", (2) "to                        
              increase the degree of success experienced by women                            
              researchers", and (3) to provide a forum for addressing                        
              problems of special concern to women."  Near-term projects                     
              include (1) preparation of computer science materials for K-                   
              12, (2) review of teaching materials for sexism, (3) regional                  
              workshops on tenure and recruiting of women, (4) mentoring of                  
              undergraduate and graduate females in computer science. (5)                    
              development of a women speakers list, and (6) surveys of                       
              graduate students.
