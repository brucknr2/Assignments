Abstract    :
                   Professors Powers and Pimsner will study aspects of the theory            
              of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras.  Professor Powers' work               
              will concern continuous one parameter semigroups of *-endomorphisms            
              of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras with particular emphasis on            
              the von Neumann algebra of all bounded operators on a Hilbert                  
              space.  Professor Pimsner will study the K-theory of operator                  
              algebras, especially that of group C*-algebras of crossed products             
              by certain classes of groups.                                                  
                   The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of a             
              family of linear transformations on a space.  These transformations            
              can also be thought of as having values in the states of the space,            
              and the property of this family which is responsible for the symbol            
              * is that the algebra is generated by transformations whose values             
              in these states are real numbers.  The fact that these objects                 
              appear naturally in many branches of mathematics and physics makes             
              them important to study.
