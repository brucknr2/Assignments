Abstract    :
              On 28 January 1989, the Argentine supply ship Bahia Paraiso ran                
              aground near Palmer Station, Antarctica, spilling 180,000 gallons              
              of diesel fuel, jet fuel and heavy lubricants into the marine                  
              environment.  The spill, which coincided with the feeding,                     
              fledgling and dispersal stages of the area's six most abundant                 
              seabird species, exposed 36,000-43,000 chicks and adults to the                
              oil.  The focus of this study is to determine the impact this spill            
              has had on seabird populations in the Palmer area.  From prior                 
              research at Palmer Station during 1987-1989, there is current data             
              on the abundance, breeding success, diets and growth rates of the              
              more numerous members of this seabird community, including marked              
              chick cohorts form 1988 (not exposed to oil) and 1989 (exposed to              
              oil).  This data will be used as baseline information in a                     
              comparative study designed to assess seabird mortality in the area             
              and determine the population's potential for recovery.  The                    
              availability of similar baseline data is rare among oil impact                 
              studies on seabird communities as a whole.  The proposed study thus            
              becomes uniquely valuable, not only in terms of assessing the                  
              impacts of an oil spill on a comparatively pristine polar seabird              
              community, but as a potential source of critical data for seabird              
              impact studies in general.
