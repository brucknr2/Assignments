Abstract    :
                   This award supports a Southern California Geometric Analysis              
              Research Seminar to be held once each year for two years at a                  
              centrally located university in Southern California.  The                      
              participating institutions include UC-Irvine, UC-Los Angeles,                  
              Caltech, UC-San Diego, UC-Santa Barbara, UC-Riverside, USC, and the            
              California State universities in the area.  Each meeting will be of            
              two days duration and will involve graduate students and                       
              postdoctoral researchers.  The speakers will be from outside the               
              Southern California region and will be encouraged to provide                   
              lectures at a level understandable to graduate students in areas of            
              current research in geometric analysis.
