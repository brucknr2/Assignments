Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant supports the operation of the Culture Collection of                 
              Algae at the University of Texas at Austin.  The UTEX culture                  
              collection center maintains over 2,000 strains of primarily                    
              freshwater algae, and is one of two such centers in the world.                 
              The other one is in Germany.  The UTEX Center distributes algae                
              in its collection to anyone who requests them at a nominal cost,               
              publishes a catalogue of its holdings, and serves as a general                 
              resource center by providing answers to questions about the                    
              biology of freshwater algae.  Requests for algae come from the                 
              U.S. as well as foreign scientists working in diverse areas of                 
              biology.  Science teachers at colleges and secondary schools also              
              request algae for classroom uses.
