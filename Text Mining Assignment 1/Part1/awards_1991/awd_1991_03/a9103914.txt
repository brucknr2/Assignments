Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              be concerned with the mathematical structure of conformal                      
              quantum field theories, and with topological aspects of                        
              quantum chromodynamics.  The work on conformal theories will                   
              help us to achieve an understanding of the force of gravity.                   
              That on quantum chromodynamics (which is the theory of the                     
              nuclear force) will shed light on phenomena where the nuclear                  
              force is very strong.
