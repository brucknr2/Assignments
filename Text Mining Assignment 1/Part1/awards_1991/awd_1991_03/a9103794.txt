Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out in                       
              nuclear structure studies of few body systems using radiative                  
              capture and pion production.  The work will be carried out at                  
              IUCF.  Improved understanding of NN potentials, meson exchange                 
              currents, and off-shell effects will be obtained.  Of                          
              particular importance are polarization measurements, which                     
              will provide new insights into these processes.  Simulations,                  
              detector development, data analysis, interpretation, and other                 
              related activities will be carried out at the University of                    
              Kentucky.
