Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides partial support for the workshop on the                    
              genome of E. coli to be held on October 16-19, 1991 at Banbury                 
              Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  The workshop will focus                
              on a discussion of the current and future efforts to sequence the              
              genome of E. coli.  Informatics and integration of E. coli genome              
              sequencing efforts with the general E. coli research community as              
              well as genome sequencing efforts of other organisms will be                   
              major topics of discussion.  The workshop is jointly supported by              
              NCHGR, DOE, NLM, and NSF.
