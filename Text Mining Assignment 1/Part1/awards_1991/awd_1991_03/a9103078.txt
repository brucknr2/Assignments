Abstract    :
                   The Fellow ill engage in high-pressure phase equilibrium                  
              experiments of selected primary mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB)                  
              analog compositions.  Such work is needed to understand the                    
              chemical differentiation of the earth's mantle and to predict the              
              chemical composition of magmas that are supplied to the base of the            
              ocean crust.  The Fellow sill undertake this work at Lamont-Doherty            
              Geological Observatory of Columbia University.
