Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The netlib system was designed to send, by return electronic mail,             
              requested mathematical software together with subsidiary routines and          
              any related documents or test programs supplied by the authors.                
              Since its inception, netlib has had a significant positive impact on           
              the infrastructure of the computational science community.  This is            
              evidenced by the fact that nearly 150,000 requests for netlib                  
              services were received in 1989 and that more than 200,000 were                 
              projected for 1990.                                                            
                                                                                             
              In this proposal support is requested for routine netlib operation             
              and expansion of its capabilities and the maintenance of NA-NET.  The          
              scope of netlib will be expanded to include new software, including            
              tools for symbolic computation.  Software will also be added which             
              will allow a user to access netlib interactively.. The use of a                
              production rule expert system the netlib server for those users with           
              less expertise will be investigated.//
