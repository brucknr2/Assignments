Abstract    :
                   Proposed Mechanisms for the production of chlorine vapor                  
              from sea-salt aerosol in the marine boundary layer have important              
              implications for tropospheric chemistry, but are as yet poorly                 
              understood.  Acid-base desorption generates relatively unreactive              
              HCl, whereas reactions involving non-acidic N gases and ozone and              
              other selected reactive species produce highly reactive chlorine               
              compounds which will initiate photochemical reactions in an                    
              analogous manner to OH.  In addition, such reactions may                       
              represent and important tropospheric sink for ozone and other                  
              selected reactive species.  This research is aimed at developing               
              new measurement capabilities for assessing interactions of                     
              reactive chlorine with ozone and other selected reactive species,              
              in the marine troposphere.  The specific research objectives                   
              include:  1. Assessing sampling artifacts for species of interest              
              and 2. Measuring major hypothesized product and reactant species               
              involved in chlorine phase change as a function of phase and                   
              particle size.
