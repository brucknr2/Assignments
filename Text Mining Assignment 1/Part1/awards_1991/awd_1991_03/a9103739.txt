Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Preliminary studies have demonstrated the feasibility and                      
              experimental utility of studying the swimming of skipjack and                  
              yellowfin tunas using a large water tunnel located at the                      
              National Marine Fisheries Service Laboratory in Hawaii.  This                  
              project will conduct a detailed study of the numerous and diverse              
              swimming specializations of these powerful and exquisitely designed            
              fishes.  Specifically, the investigators will: i) carry out                    
              measurements of tuna swimming metabolic rate and thus describe                 
              their locomotion energetics, ii) monitor aspects of tuna in vivo               
              swimming physiology and thereby determine how these fishes regulate            
              and sustain their aerobic metabolism, and iii) examine various                 
              aspects of the tuna's swimming kinematics and specialized locomotor            
              anatomy and the augmentation of swimming mechanics and efficiency.             
              This investigation will provide the first direct measurements on               
              tunas, swimming at controlled speeds, of variables ranging from                
              swimming metabolism in relation to body size, swimming                         
              cardiovascular physiology as determined by blood pressures, heart              
              rate, arterial-venous O2 differences, and calculation (by Fick) of             
              cardiac output and stoke volume.  These studies will also provide              
              the first controlled speed analyses of tuna swimming kinematics and            
              biomechanics, including caudal force and thrust generation, and                
              surface-flow visualization.
