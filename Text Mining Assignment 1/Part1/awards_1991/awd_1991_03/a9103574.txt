Abstract    :
                Anticipated research involves projects on deep inelastic                     
              scattering of electrons from various nuclear targets at SLAC.                  
              Experimental data obtained will be analyzed at SLAC and at UC-                 
              Berkeley.  The several nuclear and high energy projects in                     
              which the investigator will participate include: 1) the                        
              measurement of x, Q , and HydrogeDeuterium Dependence of R                     
              (ratio of longitudinal  to transverse photoabsorption cross                    
              section); 2) the analysis of data on electron-gas-nuclei                       
              interactions at electron energy of 14.5 GeV; and 3) the                        
              planning of future experiments utilizing a 50-GeV polarized                    
              electron beam.  In the latter, former PEGASYS collaborators                    
              expect to develop proposals for future End Station A (SLAC)                    
              experiments to study interactions of high-energy polarized                     
              electron beams on various nuclear targets.                                     
                These projects are concerned with aspects of deep inelastic                  
              electron-nucleus scattering, and will yield new information on                 
              perturbative QCD effects, nuclear scaling, and other phenomena                 
              in the interface between particle and nuclear physics.  The                    
              project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                             
              opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                 
              engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                  
              pursue careers in these areas through the investigators'                       
              enhanced visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In                   
              this project, the proposed activities which contribute to the                  
              second objective include:  teaching an upper-division course                   
              for physics majors, leading/assisting with graduate seminars                   
              on nuclear/particle physics, presenting informal guest lectures                
              or lunch talks for graduate students, mentoring of women                       
              graduate students, and serving as a catalyst for special                       
              informal meetings of women in physics, as well as stimulating                  
              contacts between women in physics and those in other                           
              scientific/engineering disciplines.
