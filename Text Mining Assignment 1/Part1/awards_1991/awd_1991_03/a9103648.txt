Abstract    :
              This research project utilizes laser spectroscopy techniques to                
              investigate fundamental physical processes in inorganic host                   
              crystals doped with transition metal and rare earth ions.  The                 
              processes to be studied include energy migration among the ions and            
              radiationless relaxation transitions.  The experimental techniques             
              to be employed include four-wave mixing, accumulated photon echos,             
              and pulse-probe transient absorption experiments.  An effort will              
              be made to verify a detailed model for the origin of the four-wave             
              mixing signal of ions in solids, in addition to characterizing the             
              energy migration between these ions in solids.  The measurements               
              will feature real time measurements in the subpicosecond regime.               
              Uniaxial stress measurements will also be employed.  It is hoped to            
              learn more about the poorly understood processes associated with               
              radiationless relaxation among the excited states of the ions in               
              solids.
