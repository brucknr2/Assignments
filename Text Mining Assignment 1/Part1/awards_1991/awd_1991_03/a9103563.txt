Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     Detailed study of the tectonic and vocanogenic history of              
              the northrnmost Mariana backarc basin will be performed using                  
              existing data from two SeaMARC II side.scan and bathymetric                    
              cruises and five Geological ZSurvey of Japan geophysical surveys.              
              Conventional bathymetry, SeaMARC II and seismic reflection data                
              will be analyzed. These data will allow the PI to test models of               
              evolution of the backarc basin spreading systems. Specifically,                
              the PI will examine the tectonic structure of the rift graben;                 
              the nature and distribution of volanism in the early stages of                 
              rifting; and determine whether the observed structures and                     
              volcanic elements agree with those predicted by existing models.
