Abstract    :
              In this project, the Principal Investigator will continue studies              
              of internal waves in coastal regions, particularly their                       
              generation and instability.  In the first task, current meter data             
              will be analyzed to determine statistics of the distribution of                
              Richardson Number, and relate it to turbulent dissipation.  In the             
              second task, a numerical model will be used to study the                       
              generation of internal waves by moving wind stress patterns.
