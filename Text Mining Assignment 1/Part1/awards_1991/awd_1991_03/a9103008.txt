Abstract    :
                   While sophisticated computational tools for dynamic analysis              
              of mechanisms exist, hardly any computational tools exist for                  
              generalized synthesis.  In order to develop a computational model              
              for mechanism synthesis, a formal foundation of the art of                     
              mechanisms design should be laid by rationalizing the process of               
              mechanical synthesis.                                                          
                   This research will develop a matrix methodology as the basis              
              for a computable approach to design synthesis.  The research                   
              should potentially enhance the fundamental understanding and                   
              computational synthesis of complex mechanical motions as                       
              combinations of simple building blocks.
