              This award will support a workshop which addresses issues in                   
              training computational and mathematical biologists.  The workshop              
              will be held at Cold Spring Harbor on December 9 and 10, 1990.                 
              The participants of this workshop will write a document that will              
              be incorporated into the larger computational biology workshop                 
              report.
