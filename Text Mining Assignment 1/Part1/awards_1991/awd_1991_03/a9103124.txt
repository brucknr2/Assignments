Abstract    :
                   This research concerns relations between the spectral theory              
              of the Laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold and the dynamics             
              of the geodesic flow. The first project concerns a restriction of              
              the isospectral problem: an assumption that the Laplacians are                 
              intertwined by a unitary Fourier integral operator.  Broadly                   
              interpreted, this restriction includes almost all known examples.              
              The second problem concerns the pair correlation function of the               
              Laplacian.  This function measures the distribution of gaps between            
              eigenvalues on the scale of the mean consecutive gap.  This                    
              function is determined by the qualitative dynamics of the geodesic             
              flow.  Recently the principal investigator determined the first                
              known pair function on certain Zoll surfaces.  This work will be               
              continued.                                                                     
                   This project is in the area of geometric analysis and deals               
              with the interface between spectral theory and dynamical systems.              
              This research may have profound applications to physics and                    
              geometry.
