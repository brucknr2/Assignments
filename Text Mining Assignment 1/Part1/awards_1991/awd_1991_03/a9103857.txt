Abstract    :
                   This award will continue support of the Pacific Northwest                 
              Geometry Conference. This series of meetings makes it possible for             
              mathematicians in the Northwest to share ideas concerning their                
              research in several areas of geometry including topics in                      
              Riemannian geometry, mathematical physics, complex analysis, and               
              geometric representation theory.                                               
                   One of the most important aspects of a successful research                
              environment is the frequent exchange of ideas and methods within a             
              field and across fields. Mathematical meetings serve as a mechanism            
              to support this interchange of ideas and this award will help                  
              defray expenses of meetings for mathematicians at a group of                   
              universities in the Pacific Northwest.
