Abstract    :
                   The Alexander terrane, SE Alaska, has the longest and most                
              complete Paleozoic stratigraphy of the Alaskan terranes, with a                
              stratigraphic and fossil record extending from the early Ordovician            
              to the Permian.  Many workers believe it began its long history in             
              the western "Protopacific" and only arrived in the vicinity of                 
              North America in late Mesozoic time.  Some preliminary faunal                  
              evidence indicates that the Alexander terrane has been closely                 
              associated throughout its Paleozoic history with the continent of              
              North America or possibly with eastern Siberia.  Faunas that have              
              been described include Silurian conodonts and brachiopods, Lower,              
              Middle and Upper Devonian conodonts and brachiopods, Mississippian             
              conodonts, and Pennsylvanian conodonts and brachiopods.  The faunas            
              described belong to the Old World Realm and show mainly Cordilleran            
              Region and Canadian Arctic affinities.                                         
                   Although several of the faunas that occur in this                         
              fossiliferous sequence have been described, other Emsian, Eifelian,            
              Givetian and Mississippian conodont faunas and silicified Middle               
              Devonian and Mississippian brachiopod faunas have been discovered              
              but remain uncollected and undescribed.  Other fossiliferous                   
              Pennsylvanian deposits were discovered but not collected in 1988.              
              Continued work on these faunas will provide additional evidence                
              concerning the terrane's origin.
