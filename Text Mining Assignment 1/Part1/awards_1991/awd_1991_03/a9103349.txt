Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will be focused on the enzyme acetohydroxy acid                  
              synthetase--a key regulatory enzyme involved in synthesis of                   
              branched chain amino acids--in the archaebacterium Methanococcus.              
              Purification of the enzyme, determination of its physical and                  
              chemical properties, and its cloning and its sequence will be the              
              major foci of the study, which will also then address the homology             
              of this enzyme with that of eubacteria and eukaryotes.  A                      
              nutritional phenomenon termed pseudoauxotrophy, relating to the                
              amino acids leucine and isoleucine will also be investigated.
