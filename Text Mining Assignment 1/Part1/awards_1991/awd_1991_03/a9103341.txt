Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The heat-flow/basement depth relation, which favors the simple                 
              thermal boundary layer model, will be tested to determine if it                
              actually is applicable to older oceanic areas.  To document this,              
              heat flow will be documented in the Late Jurassic ocean floor of               
              western Gulf of Mexico using both heat-flow measurements acquired              
              during a proposed R/V Gyre cruise and also analyzing the                       
              radioactivity of DSDP 90 and 91 sites to determine the effect of               
              radiogenic heat from 10 km of sediments on the surface heat flux.              
              Seismic refraction and reflection data will be used to compute the             
              water-loaded basement and the possible effect of thinner-than-                 
              normal crust on this depth.
