Abstract    :
              This contract with Air New Zealand has been negotiated to provide              
              Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM) on the National Science                
              Foundation's LC-130 aircraft.  The aircraft undergo a yearly                   
              overhaul, and the ability to have this maintenance performed in                
              Christchurch, New Zealand, will enhance the capability of VXE- 6               
              to accomplish its mission in the Antarctic Program.  Since the                 
              majority of the yearly flying is done in and around Christchurch               
              and Antarctica, having maintenance capability close to the source              
              of heavy flight operations will allow more flexibility in the                  
              scheduling of yearly maintenance.                                              
                                                                                             
              This contract provides aircraft maintenance support to the program             
              and will be administered, including distributions of funds, by the             
              U.S. Navy - Naval Air Pacific Repair Activity in Atsugi, Japan.                
                                                                                             
              The anticipated Air New Zealand labor costs for the term of the                
              contract are as follows:
