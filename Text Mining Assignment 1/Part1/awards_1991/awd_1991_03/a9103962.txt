Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his work on                      
              multiparamter processes and random fields.  These stochastic                   
              processes describe random phenomena whose probabilistic properties             
              are both spatial and time dependent, such as the time evolution of             
              a one-, two- or three dimensional medium subject to random                     
              excitation.  An important question in this area of probability                 
              theory is:  if one observes this random field in a certain region              
              of space-time, how does one estimate its behavior elsewhere?  The              
              investigator will study the relationship between this prediction               
              problem for a particularly important class of random field, their              
              Markov properties, and the behavior of solutions of certain                    
              stochastic partial differential equations.
