Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project examines the biochemical mechanisms and molecular                 
              bases for the ability of cyanobacterial cells (Nostoc commune) to              
              retain functional and structural integrity after repeated exposures            
              to water stress, without involving spore-formation.  A recently                
              isolated water-stress glycoprotein, "wsp", will be the subject of              
              more detailed characterization ?this will include crystallographic             
              analyses!, a protease specific for "wsp" will be purified and                  
              characterized, and a transcriptional analysis of wsp formation will            
              be undertaken as part of this project's goals.  //
