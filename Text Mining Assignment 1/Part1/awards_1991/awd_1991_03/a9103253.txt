Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is focused on understanding important aspects of                  
              synthesis of tetrapyrrole pigments that are essential components               
              in the processes of photosynthesis and respiration and are                     
              cofactors in other important cellular reactions.  A key point in               
              the biosynthetic pathway involves the intermediate, 5-amino                    
              levulinic acid, and it is the enzymes involved in synthesis of this            
              compound that will be chacterized in terms of physical and kinetic             
              properties, cofactor requirements, reaction mechanisms, possible               
              interactions, and factors affecting their syntheses and actvities.             
              Molecular probes will be generated and used to study regulation of             
              expression of the relevant genes during adaptation of the organisms            
              to light and developmental changes.
