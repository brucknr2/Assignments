Abstract    :
              The proposed conference will be held in Kona, Hawaii from August               
              25-27, 1992 as a satelite meeting to the IX International Congress             
              on Photosynthesis which meets the following week in Nagoya, Japan.             
              CO2 in the atmosphere has been increasing steadily primarily from              
              increasing human activities.  If this trend continues, the concern             
              is that global warming through the so-called "greenhouse effect"               
              will occur and result in severe environment changes.  There is also            
              concern over depletion of the ozone layer and the resulting                    
              increased exposure to potentially harmful UV-B radiation.  The                 
              effects of these and other environmental factors on photosynthetic             
              capacity and the ability of plants, globally to withstand or                   
              reverse these trends are of considerable importance to mankind.                
              The problem is obviously large and complex.  Yet, fundamental                  
              mechanisms in photosynthesis offer a way to evaluate the processes             
              that largely contribute to the ability of plants to successfully               
              respond to environmental change.  The purpose of the proposed                  
              conference is to provide a much-needed interdisciplinary forum on              
              how photosynthesis relates to this problem.  Three dimensions will             
              be examined: (1) the underlying physiology of photosynthesis, (2)              
              comparison of terrestial and marine/aquatic systems, and (3) global            
              responses.  This meeting of interdisciplinary groups should                    
              stimulate new insights, reveal new research opportunities, both                
              disciplinary and interdisciplinary, and open new opportunities for             
              collaborative research.  These outcomes are especially important               
              for researchers early in their careers.
