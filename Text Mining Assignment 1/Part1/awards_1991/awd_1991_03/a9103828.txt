Abstract    :
                   This project will develop operator theory methods for                     
              differential equations.  The main areas to be studied are Thomas-              
              Fermi theory, nonlinear partial differential equations,                        
              semilinear problems, singular perturbation, and semigroups of                  
              operators.                                                                     
                   The questions to be addressed have been motivated by models               
              arising in science and engineering.  Understanding of the                      
              fundamental properties of these models has profound implications               
              in areas such as physics, biology, and geology.
