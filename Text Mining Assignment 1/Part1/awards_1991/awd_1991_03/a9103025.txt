Abstract    :
                   The PI has recently developed a new representation of                     
              cumulus convection that attempts to overcome classical problems                
              by relating the convection explicitly to the dynamics of clouds                
              and tying the moistening effect of clouds explicitly to cloud                  
              microphysical parameters.  This grant supports studies to                      
              understand the interaction of convective clouds with large-scale               
              circulations and climate by attempting to simulate such                        
              circulations with simplified numerical models using various                    
              convection schemes, including the new scheme of the PI.                        
              The immediate objectives the PI will pursue under are:                         
                                                                                             
              1. Comprehensive radiative-convective equilibrium simulations                  
              using his new scheme;                                                          
              2. Semiprognostic tests of the new scheme;                                     
              3. Theoretical study of equatorial easterly waves;                             
              4. Construction and testing of an equatorial beta-plane numerical              
              model using several different convection schemes, with the main                
              objective of exploring the sensitivity of simulated intraseasonal              
              oscillations to the various convection schemes and to parameters               
              used by the schemes.                                                           
                                                                                             
                   This research is important because it strives to increase                 
              knowledge of the processes by which convective clouds interact                 
              with climate.
