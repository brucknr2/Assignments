Abstract    :
              Dr. Stryker will focus his studies on developing new                           
              carbon-carbon bond making reactions using transition metal                     
              organometallic complexes which permit the regioselective                       
              addition of nucleophilic reagents to the central carbon of                     
              certain eta-3-allyl complexes.  Thus, the regioselectivity                     
              normally observed in such nucleophilic additions will be                       
              reversed along with an inversion of the natural electron demand                
              shown by allylic electrophiles.  The resulting                                 
              metallacyclobutane complexes represent an important                            
              organometallic structural class.  The PI will study the                        
              mechanism of the reaction by probing the nature of the metal,                  
              its oxidation state, coordination geometry, the ancillary                      
              ligand set and the nucleophile.  Manipulation of alkylative                    
              metallacyclobutane formation is anticipated to lead to the                     
              development of useful organic synthetic methodology.

              With this award the Synthetic Organic Program will support the                 
              research of Dr. Jeffrey M. Stryker of the Department of                        
              Chemistry at Indiana University.  The research will focus on                   
              developing new methods of carbon-carbon bond formation using                   
              transition metal organometallic compounds to synthesize                        
              derivatives of cyclobutane.  The project is expected to provide                
              a deeper understanding of how such reactions occur as well as                  
              new organic synthetic methodology.
