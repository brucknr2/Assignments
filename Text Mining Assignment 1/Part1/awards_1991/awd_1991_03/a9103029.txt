Abstract    :
              Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase hydrolyzes 1 molecule of ATP              
              for each cycle of NAMN formation, and the two processes are                    
              energetically coupled.  A novel alternating affinity mechanism is              
              proposed for this coupling in which ATP use generates an E-P with              
              increased affinity for the substrates of the                                   
              phosphoribosyltransferase reaction; after phosphoribosyl group                 
              transfer, compulsory E-P hydrolysis triggered by product                       
              pyrophosphate regenerates the low affinity E form and results in               
              product release.  An E-P was shown to be mechanistically involved              
              in coupling, ADP/ATP exchanges and protein chemistry will be used              
              to characterize it.  Mutagenesis at the phosphorylated residue will            
              allow uncoupling the ATPase and NAMN synthesis activities of the               
              enzyme.  Stereochemical studies will be carried out to determine               
              if other phosphorylated intermediates exist.  The E-P has                      
              dramatically decreased Km values for substrates PRPP and                       
              nicotinate, compared to E, and the use of further binding studies              
              will quantitate the changes that occur on E-P formation.  Rapid                
              quench studies will allow the determination the order of E-P                   
              hydrolysis and phosphoribosyl group transfer in the mechanism.  By             
              learning the mechanism of energy coupling in NAPRTase.  This will              
              show how alternation in affinity can lead to coupling in more                  
              complex systems such Ca-ATPase and other vectorial transporters.
