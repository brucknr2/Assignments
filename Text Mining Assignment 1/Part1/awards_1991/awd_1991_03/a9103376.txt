Abstract    :
              The research project will focus on the development of                          
              experimental techniques for studying nuclear spin relaxation                   
              behavior and molecular motion in solid materials of chemical,                  
              biological, and technological interest.  The main tool of                      
              investigation is deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),                   
              where spin relaxation and lineshape analysis have proven to be                 
              extremely powerful techniques for elucidating motion in solids on              
              timescales ranging from microseconds to picoseconds.  One aim of               
              the proposed work is to extend the range of systems amenable to                
              slow motion analysis and to invent pulse sequences which are                   
              routinely applicable by nonspecialists.  A second project                      
              involves using molecular dynamics simulations in new ways to                   
              interpret spin relaxation data.  If successful, this project may               
              provide a new and general method of matching the optimal                       
              simulation procedure to the dynamic process of greatest                        
              experimental relevance.
