Abstract    :
              This research is for design and evaluation of architectures                    
              suitable for fuzzy logic applications.  It uses a reduced                      
              instruction set computer (RISC) as a core processor and adds a                 
              fuzzy logic instruction set.  It also contains special hardware                
              functional units for fuzzy logic related operations.  Simulation               
              and detailed prototype design will be carried out to evaluate                  
              various design tradeoffs.
