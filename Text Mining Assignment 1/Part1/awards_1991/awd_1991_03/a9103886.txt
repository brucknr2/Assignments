Abstract    :
              This Research Planning Grant is part of the Research                           
              Opportunities for Women program.  The investigator, a cultural                 
              anthropologist from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania, will              
              conduct pilot research on demographic processes in the Greek                   
              Island of Chios.  The basic problem is to understand variations                
              in population growth, as most areas of the developed world have                
              dropped from high to low growth.  This island represents a good                
              natural laboratory for this research because there are several                 
              immigrant groups with different social and economic histories.                 
              Methods will include analysis of birth and death records and in-               
              depth interviews with household members on their family plans as               
              well as surveys of economic and agricultural activities.  The                  
              purpose of the grant is to help young female investigators                     
              establish their research projects so that they can write                       
              competitive major research grants.
