Abstract    :
                   This research focuses on the management of congestion based on            
              flow control.  It will include a theoretical study of the paradigm             
              for solving networks with multiple virtual circuit window flow                 
              control and will validate the paradigm by simulation, including but            
              limited to Markovian traffic.  Particular attention will be given              
              to establishing the validity of the model which is based on the                
              Markovian assumption and other, more realistic traffic models.  The            
              research will also include the theoretical study of the application            
              of open queueing networks for modeling input rate regulation as a              
              means of flow control.  Another research topic includes the                    
              examination and evaluation of fast algorithms for real-time                    
              optimization with respect to several network measures including                
              network power, and throughput with queueing time constraints and               
              fairness.                                                                      
                   The researchers will investigate, either by analytical means              
              or by simulation, several input rate control schemes including                 
              average rate control, leaky bucket and promising variations and                
              compare them to window control.  They will study the opportunities             
              for using these methods and others described above to influence re-            
              routing and fault recovery.
