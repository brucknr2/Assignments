Abstract    :
              The proposed study is part of an on-going project to determine                 
              the cellular basis of cytoplasmic inheritance in alfalfa.  This                
              species is one of a few in which there is a predominance of male               
              plastid transmission to the offspring, and for which considerable              
              genetic data are available.  Plastid transmission is under                     
              genetic control, and genotypes have been characterized as                      
              strong,intermediate or weak male or females, according to their                
              plastid transmission frequencies.  To date the PI's laboratory                 
              has used quantitative, three dimensional ultrastructure, along                 
              with a DNA-specific fluorochrome, to analyze generative cells and              
              sperm cells of strong and weak male lines.  The first objective                
              of the proposed research is to compare the egg cells of strong                 
              and weak females to determine whether egg composition before                   
              fertilization is a determining factor in plastid inheritance, as               
              preliminary data suggest.  Further studies will analyze                        
              fertilized eggs (zygotes) and early embryos in order to follow                 
              the specific fates of male and female plastids during these                    
              critical stages of embryogenesis.  This research will complement               
              other studies utilizing techniques of classical and molecular                  
              genetics, and promise to be invaluable for providing cytological               
              explanations for observed patterns of cytoplasmic organelle                    
              inheritance in an economically important plant.
