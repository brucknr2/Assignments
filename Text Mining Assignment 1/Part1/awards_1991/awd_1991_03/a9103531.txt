Abstract    :
                   The process of accretion of tectonic terranes to the western              
              margin of the North American plate during the Early Mesozoic will              
              be studied through structural and thermochronological analysis of              
              two terrane boundaries:  the Yukon-Tanana and the Slide Mountain               
              terranes in Alaska and Canada.  Field work will provide a                      
              structural map and samples for pressure-temperature-time path                  
              analysis for these mid-crustal, terrane boundary rocks.  The                   
              results will be integrated with related studies along the strike               
              of the orogen to provide fundamental new understanding of plate                
              boundary processes.
