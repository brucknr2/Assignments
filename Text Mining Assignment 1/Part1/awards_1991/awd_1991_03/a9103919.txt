Abstract    :
              The Hess Deep, in the eastern equatorial Pacific, is a rift                    
              valley providing an exposure of young crust produced by fast-                  
              spreading on the East Pacific Rise. In the walls of the rift                   
              valley a section of normal ocean crust is available for sampling               
              and study. The presence of lower crustal rocks in the basal wall               
              and rift valley floor suggests that drilling within the Hess Deep              
              will provide rocks from the plutonic layers of the crust and                   
              shallow mantle. A proposal for drilling these deep crustal rocks               
              has been highly ranked by JOIDES.                                              
                                                                                             
              The present award will support a detailed geophysical study to                 
              constrain the crustal structure in the region proposed for                     
              drilling. Specifically the project will undertake  sea-floor                   
              seismic and gravity experiments to elucidate velocity and density              
              structure in the region surrounding the proposed drilling                      
              locations. These measurements will help to test differing models               
              for exposure of deep crustal layers in Hess Deep by serpentine                 
              diapirism or by low-angle detachment faulting. Additionally, a                 
              short survey will be done of the west flank of the East Pacific                
              Rise on crust which is conjugate to Hess Deep to define the                    
              history of spreading when the Hess Deep crust was formed.
