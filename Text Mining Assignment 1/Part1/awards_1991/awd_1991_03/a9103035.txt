Abstract    :
              This award supports a Gordon Research Conference on the Population             
              Biology and Evolution of Microorganisms.  This will be the fourth              
              meeting of this Gordon Conference, which has met biennially                    
              starting in 1985.  This is an interdisciplinary conference that                
              brings together scientists from both population biology and                    
              molecular biology.
