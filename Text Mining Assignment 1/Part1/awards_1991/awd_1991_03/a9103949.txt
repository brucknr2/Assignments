Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue her study of                     
              extremal functions and extremal Sobolev inequalities in the                    
              context of problems in Fourier analysis, nonlinear partial                     
              differential equations and spectral analysis.  In the past three               
              years she has applied Sobolev inequalities to problems involving               
              prescribing the Gaussian curvature on the 2-sphere and the scalar              
              curvature on the n-sphere and to isospectral problems on compact               
              manifolds.  In this project the principal investigator will study              
              the following four problems using extremal Sobolev inequalities:               
              Szego's projection theorem, the logarithm determinant formula                  
              for the conformal Laplacian on the n-sphere, further work on                   
              prescribing curvature and the Uniformization Theorem for compact               
              2-manifolds.
