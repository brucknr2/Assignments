Abstract    :
              The general objective of this project is to fully explore the                  
              "change-Pumping network (CPN)" concept, and to transform it into               
              a very densely integrable family of microelectronic neural                     
              networks.  The CPN, in its generic form, is the simplest                       
              interconnected array of MOS gated-diodes.  It is capable of                    
              performing inner product and thresholding operations in one                    
              direction and weighted averaging in the opposite in a simultaneous             
              fashion over the same synaptic matrix.  Yet, no visible feedback               
              path exists in the array.  This creates a very rich bidirectional              
              neural functionality in a very compact network.  The research plan             
              includes the development and refinement of network synthesis                   
              procedures, a search for self-learning ability and the entire                  
              design/fab/test cycle for implementing five different target                   
              architectures.  The goal is to extend the knowledge base in neural             
              network synthesis by offering a general procedure for non-negative             
              synaptic matrix design, and to help develop a knowledge base in                
              collective multistability Through an analysis of this fundamental              
              concept.
