Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for a small grant for exploratory research               
              (SGER): a pilot study of buried soils to attempt to detect                     
              mobilization of heavy trace metals, decalcification and                        
              podzolization that should have accompanied the nitric acid rain                
              predicted by some scenarios of extraterrestrial impact at the                  
              Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.  A suitably complete sequence of                 
              buried soils across this geological boundary has been located and              
              sampled in Bug Creek, eastern Montana.  Analyses of selected                   
              paleosols will be performed by AA (major and trace elements),                  
              isotopic dilution mass spectrometry (for Pb) and Walkley-Black (for            
              organic carbon) techniques.  Petrographic studies also will be                 
              undertaken in order to complete documentation of the subsurface                
              clayey (Bt) horizons and other paleoenvironmentally significant                
              features of the paleosols.  Nitric acid rain would be indicated by             
              strong depletion of the paleosol at the boundary in Pb and other               
              heavy metal trace elements, compared to the depth function for                 
              these elements in paleosols above and below the boundary that are              
              otherwise similar petrographically, chemically and in burial                   
              history.  Should this research prove to indicate acid rain, then               
              full scale search of other sequences of paleosols across the                   
              Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary would be warranted.  Should this                  
              research be unsuccessful indicating acid rain, it may nevertheless             
              add paleoenvironmental information for reconstructing events at                
              this place and time in Earth history.
