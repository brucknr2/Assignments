Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professors J. Carlson                
              and D. Toledo to work in algebraic geometry.  They will                        
              work on fundamental groups of complex manifolds and their                      
              representations.  They intend to study the representation theory               
              of the recently constructed examples of manifolds with                         
              non-residually finite fundamental groups.  They also intend to                 
              apply the theory of harmonic maps to enlarge the class of groups               
              for which the Shafarevic conjecture is known to be true.                       
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                
              to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems               
              that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures                 
              defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                      
              polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from                      
              algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it                
              is extensively used in those fields.  Moreover, it has proved                  
              itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical                     
              computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
