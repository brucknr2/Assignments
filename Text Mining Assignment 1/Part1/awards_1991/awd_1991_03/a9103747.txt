Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Deepwater rice is grown in large areas of Southeast Asia,  e.g.                
              Bangladesh,  where chronic flooding during the monsoon season makes            
              the cultivation of other crop plants impossible.  This rice type               
              responds to partial submergence by a rapid increase in growth.                 
              This permits the rice to keep part of its foliage above the rising             
              flood waters and to avoid "drowning."  The signal for enhanced                 
              growth is reduced oxygen tension in the submerged plant.  This                 
              promotes ethylene synthesis which in turn activates a hormone                  
              called gibberellin.  The hormone promotes rapid stem elongation.               
              The molecular processes underlying this complex series of events               
              will be studied using state of the art genetic probes.//
