Abstract    :
                   Professor Thomas will work on problems related to Wagner's                
              conjecture and Hadwiger's conjecture.  He will also investigate                
              whether there is a theory of directed graph minors as well as                  
              working in the theory of quasi-ordered sets.                                   
                   Graph Theory goes back perhaps two hundred years, but only in             
              the last half-century has the field become an active, fertile, and             
              flourishing branch of mathematics.  A graph is a network of lines              
              ("edges") joining points ("vertices"), thus the language of graphs             
              becomes a natural way of describing interrelationships among                   
              separated objects.  Graph Theory figures most prominently as an                
              essential tool in Communications Theory and Computer Science.
