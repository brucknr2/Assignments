Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will do research on dynamical phenomena             
              of electron systems at surfaces including vibrational line shapes,             
              non-adiabatic charge transfer, atom-surface scattering, and                    
              sticking.  Also, the behavior of electron gas correlation functions            
              and their implications for non-uniform systems.  The principal                 
              investigator plans to develop theories of what the various                     
              experimental problems of particle motions actually measure and to              
              discover fundamental principles concerning their motion.
