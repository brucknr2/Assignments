Abstract    :
              The morphological transitions involved in the origin of                        
              mammals, and the composition changes in tetrapod faunas                        
              during the Late Triassic, are the foci of this research.                       
              This award supports the retrieval of material critical to                      
              addressing the problem of mammalian origins in association                     
              with fossiliferous, continental sediments; such an                             
              association has been discovered in the Late Triassic Fleming                   
              Fjord Formation of Jameson Land in East Greenland, an area                     
              that offers a greater range of stratigraphic and lithologic                    
              exposures than those in which Late Triassic mammals have                       
              previously been found.  Several localities with dense                          
              concentrations of well preserved bones of smaller                              
              vertebrates have been identified.  This award will support                     
              field investigations of microfaunal localities which may                       
              provide evidence critical to understanding mammalian origins                   
              as well as evaluating current hypotheses of vertebrate                         
              faunal evolution during the Late Triassic.
