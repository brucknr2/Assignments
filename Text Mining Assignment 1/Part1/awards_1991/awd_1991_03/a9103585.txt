Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his study of                     
              questions involving functions of several complex variables                     
              related to potential theory, dynamical systems and holomorphic                 
              mapping.  With regard to potential theory, he will study                       
              properties of the complex Monge-Ampere operator and its                        
              relationship to the stability of the Dirichlet problem and to the              
              pluri-complex Green function.  With regard to dynamical systems,               
              he will study the behavior of invertible polynomial mappings of                
              complex Euclidean space, especially the equilibrium measure of                 
              the analog of the Julia set.  And with regard to holomorphic                   
              mappings, he will try to classify the smoothly bounded domains                 
              that have noncompact automorphism groups.
