Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Transgenic mice will be made using a site-specific yeast                       
              recombinase, FLP, under direction of either the insulin or the hox             
              promoter to permanently activate expression of beta-galactosidase              
              in specific cells.  Those cells, as well as their progeny, that                
              transiently express insulin or hox during development of the                   
              nervous system will be marked.  This method also has the potential             
              for introducing an FLP site into cells so that DNA an be integrated            
              into predetermined chromosomal locations in specific cell types.               
              Through the use of various promoters, this method has enormous                 
              potential for mapping gene expression patterns during development              
              and for studying effects of gene deletion and gene function.                   
              Transgenic mice developed with this technology will be particularly            
              valuable to studies of development of specificity and function in              
              the nervous system.
