Abstract    :
                   The continued convergence of India northward into Asia                    
              requires that intraplate shortening be taken up by crustal                     
              thickening along major thrusts and lateral extrusion of crustal                
              blocks along strike-slip faults.  Assessment of the relative                   
              contributions of these two mechanisms requires detailed measurement            
              of vertical and horizontal motions on the major faults.  The Ailao-            
              Shan Red River fault in Yunnan, PRC is a Tertiary ductile strike-              
              slip zone with up to 500km of left-lateral motion.  This study will            
              date the time of the end of left-lateral motion and start of the               
              present regime of right-lateral and normal fault motion.  It will              
              also resolve the uplift rate during faulting by 40Ar/39Ar analysis             
              of the exhumed fault rocks.  The results of this study will                    
              significantly add to our understanding of the lithospheric response            
              to crustal collision.
