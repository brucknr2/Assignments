Abstract    :
              Ultra high speed signal processing on silicon is a key requirement             
              in applications such as computer vision, three-dimensional                     
              graphics, and phased array radar.  The majority of these advanced              
              algorithms require the use of nonlinear functions such as the                  
              reciprocal,the square-root, and trigonometric functions.  This                 
              project is to research the development of Reduced Cycle Nonlinear              
              Multi-Function Chips to meet these critical needs and to gain new              
              knowledge in this key area.  The proposed approach would reduce                
              such nonlinear computations for 32-bit data to two clock cycles,               
              or even a single cycle at the expense of increased complexity the              
              approach is also function independent.  It offers the potential of             
              providing multi-function capability on a single chip/cell.                     
                                                                                             
              The functions chosen for the proposed research, based upon a study             
              of signal processing algorithms, are the reciprocal, square-root,              
              sine/cosine, and the arctan functions it will also study two-                  
              argument functions.  The specific functions chosen are complex (and            
              thus two-argument) magnitude, phase, reciprocal, and logarithm                 
              functions.
