Abstract    :
              Development of new polymeric materials involves new arrangements of            
              monomers as much as it does development of new monomers.  Recently,            
              interest has focused on polymeric surfactants adsorbed on surfaces.            
              Block copolymers or end-adsorbing polymers have amphiphilic                    
              character, meaning that they tend to form aggregates or                        
              microstructures such as micelles, microemulsions, lamellae and                 
              monolayers.  Chains are tethered in these structures in that they              
              are attached by their ends.  The aim of this workshop is to bring              
              together researchers from many countries with experimental and                 
              theoretical experience in all aspects of tethered polymer chains to            
              discuss the latest issues and advance the state of understanding of            
              this important category of polymeric materials.  Proceedings of the            
              workshop will be published.
