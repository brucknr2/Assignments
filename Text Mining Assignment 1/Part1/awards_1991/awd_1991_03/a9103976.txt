Abstract    :
                   This project will develop a unified approach to existence,                
              uniqueness and stability of solutions to equations arising in                  
              magnetohydrodynamics and the dynamics of incompressible fluids.                
              The main problems involve nonlinear eigenvalue problems                        
              formulated from basic physical principles.  Analytic and                       
              numerical studies will be undertaken to solve such problems.                   
                   This project attempts to explain fundamental questions                    
              concerning fluids of interest to geophysics, oceanography, and                 
              nuclear fusion.
