Abstract    :
                This project will focus on the distributions and physical                    
              properties of molecular and atomic clouds in galaxies and their                
              relations to star formation.  The molecular clouds are traced                  
              by millimeter wave emission from carbon monoxide, and the                      
              atomic gas is seen via 21-cm radiation from neutral hydrogen                   
              (HI).  The distributions of star forming regions will be                       
              determined by observations of ionized hydrogen.  This research                 
              will address the specific problems of: (1) the effects of                      
              spiral density waves on the molecular clouds and the local star                
              formation efficiency; (2) the physical properties of the                       
              molecular gas in the nuclei and disks of late-type galaxies;                   
              (3) the evolution origin of the interstellar medium in                         
              lenticular galaxies; and (4) the role of HI in molecular cloud                 
              shielding within dwarf irregular galaxies.                                     
                This work will lead to an improved understanding of the                      
              global and local processes which regulate the star formation                   
              histories of galaxies.  The project also furthers VPW program                  
              objectives to provide opportunities for women to advance their                 
              careers in science or engineering through research, and to                     
              encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas through                 
              the investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the                   
              host campuses.  In this project, the proposed activities which                 
              contribute to the second objective include: leading an advanced                
              topics seminar on radio astronomy; teaching, "Galaxies and                     
              Cosmology", an astrophysics course for junior and senior                       
              physics majors; involving at least one student per semester in                 
              some aspect of the research; teaching Introductory Physics                     
              laboratories; and delivering general colloquia.
