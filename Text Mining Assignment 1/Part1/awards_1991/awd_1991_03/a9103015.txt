Abstract    :
                   Data from small-angle scattering in collisions between                    
              helium projectiles and rare gas target atoms will be analyzed to               
              yield accurate determinations of the ground state potential                    
              energy of these systems as a function of internuclear separation.              
              Results will be obtained by fitting a realistic potential model                
              (HFD) to published keV-energy collision data using a least                     
              squares minimization procedure.  The focus of this study is the                
              repulsive barrier at energies greater than 0.1 eV, a region which              
              at present is poorly characterized relative to our understanding               
              of the interaction potential at lower energies.                                
                   The work will be carried out primarily by undergraduate                   
              students and will provide excellent training for them on a                     
              project that is well suited for undergraduate participation and                
              will train them the techniques of computer based reduction of                  
              experimental data.
