Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will continue her              
              important work on the well-posedness of systems of partial                     
              differential equations that can change type.  Such systems have                
              solutions of shock-wave type that serve as mechanisms for the                  
              propoagation of waves, even in parts of the domain where the                   
              system is no longer hyperbolic.  These types of problems occur in              
              the transonic flow of gases and in the flow of multi-phase fluids              
              through porous media.  In particular, the principal investigator               
              will study the stability of shock waves in systems of equations                
              that undergo changes from hyperbolic to elliptic type using                    
              regularization and perturbation methods.                                       
                   The behavior of fluids (liquids and gases) under unusual                  
              conditions such as in the upper atmosphere or in the earth is                  
              governed by a complicated system of partial differential                       
              equations that can under go what is called a "change of type".                 
              Basically this means that the system has solutions of different                
              kinds in different parts of the domain.  As an illustration,                   
              think of the behavior of a seismic wave generated inside the                   
              earth by a earthquake.  The wave passes through regions that are               
              in liquid, solid or composite states.  In this project the                     
              principal investigator will examine certain solutions of a system              
              of model equations that exhibit change-of-type behavior that are               
              known as "shock waves".  The study of shock waves arises in such               
              technologically important areas as transonic flow and flow                     
              through porous media.
