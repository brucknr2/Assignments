Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Pacific-Antarctic ridge is the key link in the plate                  
              circuit describing the relative motion of the plates of the Pacific            
              basin and the surrounding continental terranes.  this project                  
              involves a shipboard survey of a critical flowline, at high                    
              latitude, crossing the Pacific-Antarctic ridge.  the objectives of             
              the program are to : (1) construct a high resolution plate                     
              kinematic model of the South Pacific for the past 50 Ma; (2)                   
              analyze the temporal evolution of both ridge parallel and fracture             
              zone crustal morphology; (3) model the deep structure of fracture              
              zone FZ XII using combined Geosat, Hydrosweep, and gravity data;               
              and (4) evaluate the contributions of chemical remnant                         
              magnetization and thermo-viscous magnetization to the source of                
              marine magnetic anomalies.
