Abstract    :
                   The matrix generalization of the Euler product has been                   
              introduced in previous work, and it has been shown that                        
              the Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to the convergence question               
              for related products of Moebius transformations.  The present                  
              project is an estimation theory of such products which would                   
              be sufficient to answer the question posed by Riemann.  In order               
              to accomplish this it is proposed to construct disks that are                  
              mapped into each other by successive Moebius transformations of                
              the matrix product.                                                            
                    The solution of the Riemann Hypothesis is indeed the Holy                
              Grail of analysis, and the principal investigator is by most                   
              accounts the most capable person in the world to attempt                       
              a solution.  Even if a complete resolution does not result from                
              this work the results that are obtained will be of tremendous                  
              value.
