Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     This study actually consists of two research programs. The             
              first, and probably most important, is an attempt to corroborated              
              the possibility that the maximum sediment thickness in the Bengal              
              basin exceed 22km, rather than the 16km generally cited. The                   
              second is the study of two aseismic ridges aligned about N.S in                
              the Bay of Bengal, the Ninetyeast Ridge and the 85 E Ridge.                    
              Existing magnetic and seismic reflection data will be combined                 
              and extended with gravity network to understand the state of                   
              isostasy in the region.
