Abstract    :
                   The Fellow will examine the degree of which natural                       
              amphibolite- grad metamorphic rocks have been infiltrated by                   
              external fluids during prograde P-T evolution.  The critical tools             
              are modeling and measurement of oxygen isotope zonation in garnets             
              whose cation zonation and P-T paths are well determined.  The                  
              measured isotopic variation in garnets and inclusion phases will               
              there be compared with that predicted by the closed system models              
              to determine whether the rocks have been infiltrated by an                     
              extensional fluid of different isotopic signature.  The Fellows'               
              host institution will be the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
