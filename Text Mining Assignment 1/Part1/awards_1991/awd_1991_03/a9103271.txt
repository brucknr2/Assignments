Abstract    :
                This project looks at the work of small-firm and solo legal                  
              practitioners as they confront new opportunities to market and                 
              advertise services, incorporate innovative ways to computerize                 
              offices, and respond to the entry of women into the labor                      
              market.  In various and complicated ways, each of these                        
              developments captures essential themes of the late twentieth                   
              century and challenges traditional professional practices.  The                
              ways in which these legal practitioners describe and understand                
              their life-style, values, aspirations, expectations, and                       
              commitments provide an entry point for examining contemporary                  
              economic, political, and social values of urban America.                       
                This effort addresses a significant and little-studied issue                 
              in law and social science, how developments in marketing,                      
              technology, and the participation of women in the law labor                    
              force have affected small and solo practitioner firms. It                      
              furthers VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for                   
              women to advance their careers in science or engineering                       
              through research, and to encourage other women to pursue                       
              careers in these areas through the investigators' enhanced                     
              visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In this                       
              project, the proposed activities which contribute to the second                
              objective include:  teaching a graduate course in the sociology                
              department, and giving seminars at the law school, sociology                   
              department, and Center for the Study of Women.
