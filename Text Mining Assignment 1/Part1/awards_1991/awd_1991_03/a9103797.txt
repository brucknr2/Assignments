Abstract    :
                   Ciscoes of the Laurentian Great Lakes once represented the                
              most diversified incipient species flock of Coregonus in North                 
              America.  Though the taxonomy of the coregonine fishes has always              
              been difficult to resolve, the extensive extirpations and                      
              extinctions of ciscoes which have occurred throughout the Great                
              Lakes system within the last few decades have hampered efforts to              
              classify remaining stocks of fish and to understand the                        
              evolutionary process involved in their speciation.  The proposed               
              study would involve restriction fragment length polymorphism                   
              (RFLP) analysis of nuclear DNA and restriction site mapping                    
              analysis of mitochondrial DNA, later followed by polymerase chain              
              reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of rapidly-evolving                
              nuclear and mitochondrial genes from fresh and museum specimens                
              of Laurentian, Artic, and Eurasian ciscoes.  Cladograms                        
              constructed from DNA-level homologies will be compared to those                
              derived from morphological data to deduce genetic relationships                
              among these fishes.  Results of this research may lead to a                    
              better understanding of the evolution of the Coregoninae, reveal               
              underlying genetic principles behind the evolution of fish                     
              species flocks, and enable genetically sound management of                     
              remaining stocks of ciscoes in the Great Lakes.
