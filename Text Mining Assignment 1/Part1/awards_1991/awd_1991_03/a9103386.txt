Abstract    :
                   This project continues studies in near-integrable systems,                
              concentrating on four main problems:  solution of the                          
              small-dispersion KdV equation, the Toda shock problem, the                     
              small-dispersion long-time limit of the nonlinear Schrodinger                  
              equation, and relations of inverse scattering theory to nearly                 
              integrable evolution equations. Integrable systems of partial                  
              differential equations often have solutions whose properties can               
              be exactly established.  This is quite unlike the usual case for               
              nonlinear partial differential equations.  What is important                   
              here is that often the properties remain when the system is                    
              perturbed.  Thus one can tell a great deal about                               
              otherwise intractable problems.                                                
                   Such problems arise in nonlinear optics (for example, in                  
              the design of long-distance communication networks using                       
              fiber optics), in the motion of waves in nonlinear acoustic                    
              media, and in flows around thin wings.
