Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigators will work with                
              graduate students on the subject of rational interpolation in the              
              complex domain by Pade' approximants and continued fractions.                  
              These topics are intimately related to moment theory, orthogonal               
              polynomials, Laurent polynomials and Gaussian quadrature.  The                 
              principal investigators and their students will apply their                    
              results to the computation of special functions and to problems                
              in digital signal processing.                                                  
                   The field of rational approximation is one of the oldest                  
              areas of classical analysis and one with many important                        
              connections to other fields of science and engineering.  In this               
              project the principal investigators will work with graduate                    
              students to study the location of zeros of polynomials for use in              
              developing quadrature formulas, studying the convergence                       
              properties of continued fractions (Pade' approximants) and                     
              determining hidden periodicities in a given digital signal.
