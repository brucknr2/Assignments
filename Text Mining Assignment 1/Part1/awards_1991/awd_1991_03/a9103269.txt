Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out in                       
              fundamental electroweak interactions in nuclear systems.  The                  
              experimental studies will be conducted at TRIUMF in Canada and                 
              involve radiative muon capture in hydrogen and ordinary muon                   
              capture in sd-shell nuclei.  Improved experimental                             
              verification of the partially conserved axial current                          
              hypothesis is sought, as well as are new limits on the                         
              possibility of medium effects on the induced axial currents.                   
              Simulations, data analysis, interpretation, and other related                  
              activities will be carried out at the University of Kentucky.
