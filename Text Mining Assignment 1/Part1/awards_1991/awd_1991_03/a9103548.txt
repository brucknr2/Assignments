Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This work will provide a coherent data set consisting of                  
              bathymetry, geophysics petrology, and hydrothermal activity for a              
              substantial length of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge affected by the                   
              Azores hotspot.  The overall aim to find the links among the                   
              diverse types of data in order to contribute to more                           
              comprehensive models of ocean crust formation. Petrologic                      
              sampling of a diversity of segment types will reveal the scale of              
              petrological segmentation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the                       
              relationships between petrological variations and segment type,                
              and provide data to test geophysical models of the organization                
              and mechanism of melt segregation and supply to the crust.  Also,              
              sufficient sampling to define the fractionation trends for                     
              individual segments and to investigate the relationship between                
              major and trace element variations should reveal far more about                
              the nature of the Azores hotspot. Hydrothermal studies are                     
              designed to inventory as completely as possible the amount of                  
              geothermal mass and heat stored over this redge section, and to                
              establish the number and location of any hydrothermally active                 
              areas on this section of the ridge.
