Abstract    :
                This study will seek to understand the dynamics of the Cuban                 
              upper class as a central factor in the origins of the 1959                     
              revolution.  Upper class failure to coalesce class alliances,                  
              direct state policies, and define relations with the United                    
              States is a much neglected dimension of how radical revolution                 
              was possible in Cuba.  The study of Cuba has been largely                      
              marginal to the literatures on Latin America development and                   
              revolutions.  It is hoped to integrate Cuba into these                         
              literatures by focusing on the Cuban upper class and society                   
              before 1959.  The study will be delimited by 1868 and 1960 for                 
              two reasons.  The struggle for national independence is central                
              to the Cuban historical experience and the first war against                   
              Spain began in 1868.  The sugar industry is likewise central                   
              to Cuban development and its more capital-intensive                            
              transformation occurred after 1868.  How the upper class (sugar                
              and non-sugar) related to other classes, the state, and                        
              economic development is crucial for the processes of class                     
              formation and state-building before 1959.  The origins of the                  
              revolution need to be placed within the dynamics of the society                
              that failed to sustain capitalism--not in some notion of                       
              "betrayal" by Fidel Castro once in power.  The study will be                   
              closed in 1960 when the old order unraveled.                                   
                The study will examine one country in Latin America that has                 
              served as a model of development, both theoretically within the                
              dependency literature and empirically with the high quality-                   
              of-life indicators, and contribute to understanding of how                     
              social class coalitions and state interventions interact to                    
              produce eventual revolutionary outcomes.  Results will be used                 
              by those trying to synthesize and reconstruct explanations of                  
              Third World (and particularly Latin American) order and                        
              breakdown politically.  The project furthers VPW program                       
              objectives to provide opportunities for women to advance their                 
              careers in science or engineering through research, and to                     
              encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas through                 
              the investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the                   
              host campuses.  In this project, the proposed activities which                 
              contribute to the second objective include:  teaching a seminar                
              on Latin America revolutions (Mexico, Bolivia, Cuba,                           
              Nicaragua); attending two advance research seminars (on Latin                  
              American and state formation and collective action); and                       
              coordinating the monthly Latin American colloquium at the                      
              Center for Studies of Social Change.
