Abstract    :
                   This project will develop a variety models of diffusion in                
              heterogeneous media as nonlinear systems of partial differential               
              equations.  These diffusion processes include heat conduction                  
              with phase change, diffusion through porous or fissured media,                 
              absorption from a flowing medium by granulated substance, and the              
              macroscopic description of semiconductors modelled as distributed              
              layered systems.                                                               
                   These studies are motivated by the need to recognize the                  
              correct mathematical formulation of phenomena arising in areas                 
              ranging from oil reservoir simulation to semiconductors.  The                  
              underlying theme is the understanding of the nature of the                     
              corresponding microstructure.
