Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study Ricci deformation of the            
              metric on Riemannian manifolds. This technique was introduced by               
              Hamilton in 1982 and has since become a useful and well known                  
              method in differential geometry. The goal of the research supported            
              by this award is a better understanding of the topology of                     
              manifolds which satisfy restrictions on curvature and Ricci                    
              curvature in particular. The theory of parabolic partial                       
              differential equations will be used to obtain estimates on the                 
              solution of the Ricci deformation which should then lead to                    
              additional topological information.                                            
                   A physical example of parabolic deformation of curvature is               
              the deformation a stretched rubber band would experience if it were            
              immersed in a viscous fluid such as oil. It is possible to show                
              that the band would asymptotically deform to a circle if the                   
              enclosed area were renormalized to one. This method can be used to             
              study the topology of a surface or manifold in more complicated                
              situations. The principal investigator will try to obtain precise              
              estimates for the size of the deformations and use that information            
              to obtain topological information.
