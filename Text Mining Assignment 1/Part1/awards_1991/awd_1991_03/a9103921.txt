Abstract    :
              This proposal describes an electron diffraction study of the                   
              structure of free-standing smectic liquid crystal films that                   
              exhibit novel hexatic ordering.  Special attention will be given to            
              the behavior near crystal-hexatic and hexatic liquid phase                     
              transitions, and the dependence on sample thickness, and the                   
              occurrence of surface induced phase transitions will be studied.
