Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A pilot study is propoosed to evaluate the usefulness of                       
              15/N/14N ratios for studying the sedimentary nitrogen cycle.                   
              Denitrification in marine sediments, particularly on                           
              continental shelves, is a principal sink for combined nitrogen                 
              from the ocean and in addition to nitrification is known to                    
              strongly fractionate nitrogen isotopes.  For sediments, coupled                
              nitrification-denitrification and transport control of fluxes                  
              are likely to strongly modify these fractionation effects.                     
              Initial objectives will be to determine whether nitrogen                       
              isotopic signals are sufficiently large such that they are both                
              coherent and interpretable.  Model analysis suggests that this                 
              will be the case.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Sites in Buzzards Bay-MA, along a transect between the Gulf of                 
              Maine and Bermuda will be studied.   15N values for pore-water                 
              NO3-, NH4+, and sediment PN will be determined downcore and                    
              flux chamber experiments will be carried out to determine the                  
              net isotopic effect with respect to the water column.                          
              Incubation experiments of core slices will be carried out to                   
              determine microbial fractionation factors.
