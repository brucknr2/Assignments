Abstract    :
                   Fifteen of the 26 sporadic simple groups have now been                    
              characterized in terms of flag-transitive actions on k-fold                    
              extensions of locally polar spaces and generalized polygons.  The              
              problem of classifying these types of geometries is closely                    
              related to the problem of classifying 1 - arc transitive graphs                
              with a given local structure.  The principal investigator will                 
              continue his work in this area and on related problems involving               
              presentations for the sporadic groups, the amalgam method and the              
              Moufang property for generalized polygons.                                     
                   A group is an algebraic structure with a multiplication                   
              defined on it.  One of the major mathematical accomplishments of               
              the past 15 years was the classification of the finite simple                  
              groups.  There are 26 exceptional groups, called the sporadic                  
              simple groups, which did not fit into the classification scheme.               
              These had to be handled individually.  This research is aimed at               
              a unified approach to the sporadic simple groups.
