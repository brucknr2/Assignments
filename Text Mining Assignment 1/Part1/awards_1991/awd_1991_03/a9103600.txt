Abstract    :
                   This project will investigate optimal control of partial                  
              differential equations and viscosity solutions for Hamilton                    
              Jacobi systems.  Iterative schemes, maximum principles, and                    
              apriori estimates are the main techniques to be used.                          
                   The questions to be studied have been motivated by and are                
              applicable to models in population dynamics such as optimal                    
              trapping strategies for diffusing beaver populations and                       
              biodegradation of hazardous chemicals.
