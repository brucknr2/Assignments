Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the study of some interrelated             
              questions of local cohomology, etale cohomology and the number of              
              defining equations of algebraic varieties.  Some progress has been             
              made on these problems recently, but much remains to be done.  It              
              is still unknown whether every non-singular subvariety of affine               
              space is a set-theoretic complete intersection.  The structure of              
              local cohomology modules remains a mystery.  The relationship                  
              between the cohomological dimension and the etale cohomological                
              dimension is still unclear.  Some technical questions about local              
              etale cohomology remain open.  The principal investigator will                 
              study these questions using methods that have been successful in               
              the past as well as developing some new methods.                               
                   Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects                  
              arising from the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial equations.             
              This is one of the oldest and currently one of the most active                 
              branches of mathematics.  It has widespread applications in                    
              mathematics, computer science and physics.
