Abstract    :
              The project focuses on three major efforts.  First, a                          
              mechanistic study on Co-Rh mixed metal catalyst systems will be                
              carried out to probe catalysis by Co-Rh bimetallic di- and                     
              tetranuclear complexes with regard to the highly regio- and                    
              stereoselective silylformylation and hydrosilylation of                        
              1-alkynes.  Second, applications of the silylformylation                       
              reaction to the silylformylation-annulation of alkynyl amines                  
              and silylformylation-carbocyclization will be examined as a                    
              route to functionalized heterocycles.  Third, approaches to                    
              effective asymmetric induction will be studied by the use of                   
              chelation-directed regio- and stereocontrol in carbonylations.

              With this award the Synthetic Organic Program renews support of                
              the research of Dr. Iwao Ojima of the Department of Chemistry                  
              at the State University of New York, Stonybrook.  The ultimate                 
              goal of the work is to design and develop multi-functional                     
              multi-catalyst systems that will enable the chemist to carry                   
              out multi-step synthesis in one reaction vessel in a highly                    
              organized manner.  The research wiil provide new and efficient                 
              synthetic methods, and an improved understanding of both                       
              bimetallic catalysis and regio- and stereocontrol mediated by                  
              transition metal complexes.
