Abstract    :
              The proposed investigation will develop a methodology to determine             
              the worst shape of imperfection for any lattice type structure, as             
              well as a simple relationship between the magnitude of the                     
              imperfection and the corresponding drop in a load carrying capacity            
              that is a asymptotically exact for small imperfections.  This will             
              be achieved by means of the Lyapunov-Schmidt-Koiter decomposition              
              followed by asymptotic results, as well as by an iterative                     
              numerical technique which allows the limit point for the imperfect             
              structure to be traced while changes in the size and/or shape of               
              the imperfection (or other design parameter) are made.
