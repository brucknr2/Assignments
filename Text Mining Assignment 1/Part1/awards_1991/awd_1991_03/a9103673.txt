Abstract    :
                   Variation in nucleotide sequence in the gene rbcL will be                 
              used to study phylogeny within the green algal order                           
              Coleochaetales (class Charophyceae).  Because of an apparent                   
              close relation between Coleochaetales and plants (embryophytes),               
              this project has the potential to clarify the longstanding                     
              problem of the nature of the algal ancestor to plants.  The taxa               
              involved are small and difficult to obtain in large biomass; the               
              polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will be used to amplify rbcL in                
              order to obtain adequate quantities of DNA for analysis.  Data                 
              will be analyzed with a variety of parsimony (and distance)                    
              methods.
