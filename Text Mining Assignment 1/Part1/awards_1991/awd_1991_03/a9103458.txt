Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will experimentally determine the                   
              equilibrium solubilities of several geologically important silicate            
              minerals at elevated temperatures and pressures. Measurements will             
              be made in aqueous solutions containing either salt, argon, or                 
              carbon dioxide. Resulting data will be used to model fluid-rock                
              interactions that occur during metamorphism of the Earth's crust.
