Abstract    :
                   This project concerns theoretical and practical aspects of the            
              Homeomorphism Problem for 3-manifolds (to algorithmically recognize            
              the topological type of a given 3-manifold).  In its full                      
              generality, the solvability of this problem is still an open                   
              question, but for a large class of 3-manifolds, the corresponding              
              problem has been solved.  Typically, those algorithms which                    
              completely solve a Recognition Problem are slow (i.e., of                      
              exponential time-demand), while the fast (polynomial-time)                     
              algorithms give only partial results.  Recently, the investigator              
              found a complete algorithm for recognizing the "unknot" which is               
              also fast; however, the proof that the worst-case time-demand is,              
              indeed, polynomially bounded, is not yet complete.  The                        
              investigator intends to complete the work on the fast recognition              
              of the unknot, and to extend the result to some related recognition            
              problems.  He also intends to simplify the older theory by means of            
              recently discovered results.
