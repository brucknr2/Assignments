Abstract    :
                   Microzooplankton (protozoans and micrometazoans) are                      
              abundant in the sea and play significant roles in pelagic food                 
              webs.  Estimating microzooplankton biomass, however, is a tedious              
              and relatively specialized process.  Techniques are needed to                  
              augment traditional approaches.                                                
                   It is known that algal pigment content is roughly                         
              proportional to biomass.  The hypothesis of the present study is               
              that carotenoid pigment content in microzooplankton is also                    
              correlated with biomass.  The objectives of this research are to               
              test this hypothesis and to identify environmental forcing                     
              functions responsible for variability in the relationship.                     
              Findings, to date, support the hypothesis, but elaboration is                  
              necessary.  Experiments will be undertaken to identify the                     
              influence of food availability, light intensity and spectral                   
              characteristics, and population growth on the pigment:biomass                  
              relationship.  In addition, the analytical method, which involves              
              HPLC, will be modified to increase carotenoid resolution.  The                 
              improved method will provide data at higher rates than presently               
              possible, and may allow discrimination between micrometazoan and               
              protozoan biomass.
