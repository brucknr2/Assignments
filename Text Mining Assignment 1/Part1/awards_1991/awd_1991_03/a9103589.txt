Abstract    :
              The proposed research will focus on the numerical simulation of                
              localized failure in the form of discontinuous bifurcation.  A                 
              unified approach will be developed to capture spatial                          
              discontinuities within fixed grid and moving grid methods using                
              mesh re-alignment.  The computational framework to be developed                
              will provide (i) singularity-enriched finite elements with the                 
              ability to transmit localized failure within a fixed grid lay-out,             
              (ii) grid re-alignment strategies in order to capture                          
              discontinuities of the first order via nodal re-location.  The                 
              proposed work will also encompass theoretical and computational                
              developments to regularize softening formulations via nonlocal                 
              fracture energy concepts.
