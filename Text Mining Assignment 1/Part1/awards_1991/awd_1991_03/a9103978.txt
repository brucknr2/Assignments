Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the melting behavior of                  
              primitive meteorites at high pressures and temperatures. The                   
              experiments will be designed to simulate conditions which may                  
              have existed at depth in a growing proto-Earth as it reached                   
              maximum radius. The results of this study will help scientists                 
              understand how the Earth developed during its earliest stages as               
              a planet.
