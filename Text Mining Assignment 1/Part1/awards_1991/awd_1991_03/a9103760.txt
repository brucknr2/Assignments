Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                The single cells of Phycomyces blakesleeanus have been studied              
              by many scientists during the past four decades.  These large plant            
              cells, which can grow up to twenty centimeters in length, can                  
              detect and respond to many different environmental and sensory                 
              stimuli (such as light, gravity, mechanical stretching, and wind)              
              with a change in growth rate (which is relatively easy to measure).            
              Some scientists hope that these studies will provide a better                  
              understanding of how the environmental and sensory stimuli are                 
              processed by the cell (sensory transduction), and how the plant                
              cell regulates its growth rate.  The goal of the present work is               
              to establish equations which describe the growth rate of these                 
              plant cells, so that a more detailed, comprehensive, and                       
              quantitative understanding of growth rate regulation is obtained.              
              These equations may also provide the framework by which the                    
              biochemical events, which occur in sensory transduction, may be                
              related to the measurable changes in the growth rate of the plant              
              cell.
