Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research to determine the                          
              technical feasibility of a process for removal of organic                      
              substances of potentially toxic significance from water.                       
              The process involves passage of contaminated water through                     
              a fixed-bed, adsorbing medium and regeneration of the                          
              exhausted adsorbing medium by a photocatalytic process                         
              based on use of n-type semiconductor photocatalysts such                       
              as titanium dioxide.  Regeneration of the adsorbing medium                     
              and destruction of the adsorbates are expected to be                           
              accomplished by radical species formed when the catalysis                      
              is subjected to illumination with ultra- and near-ultra                        
              light radiation.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Adsorption processes are recognized as being effective for                     
              removal of organic pollutants from water.  Economic                            
              feasibility of adsorption depends largely on ability to                        
              regenerate the adsorbing properties of the adsorbing                           
              medium and to deal effectively with the organic substances                     
              released during the regeneration process.  Results of this                     
              research are expected to be used for devising mathematical                     
              models that can be used in potential selection and                             
              engineering design of processes and systems for use in                         
              decontamination of water for municipal and industrial                          
              needs.
