Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator and his students               
              will work on a number of problems in complex variable theory                   
              centered around the distribution of values of complex functions.               
              In particular, they will study the ramification and value-                     
              distribution properties of quasi-regular mappings, the                         
              exceptional set in the Gross star theorem and in Plessner's                    
              theorem, and the error term in the Nevanlinna theory.  In                      
              addition,  the principal investigator and his students will                    
              explore the application of some of this work to problems in                    
              differential equations and complex iteration.                                  
                   The area of complex variable theory has had a long and                    
              distinguished history, and the principal investigator is one of                
              the leaders in the subarea of complex variable theory concerned                
              with the distribution of the values of complex functions.  In                  
              this project the principal investigator will work with graduate                
              students to extend our knowledge of the value-distribution                     
              properties of various classes of functions that arise as                       
              solutions of differential equations in the complex plane.
