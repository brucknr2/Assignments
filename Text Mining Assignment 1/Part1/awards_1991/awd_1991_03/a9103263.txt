Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor S. Rallis and               
              Professor D. Ginzburg to work in automorphic functions.  Professor             
              Rallis intends to work on the relation of the Rankin Selberg                   
              integral representation of L functions to various problems in the              
              theory of automorphic forms.  Professor Ginzburg intends to work on            
              applications of the Rankin Selberg method to Langland's conjecture.            
                   Modular forms arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the                  
              middle of the nineteenth century.  Both mathematicians and                     
              physicists have thus long realized that many objects of fundamental            
              importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.  This field is             
              principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but              
              in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its              
              historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge             
              theory in theoretical physics and coding theory in information                 
              theory.
