Abstract    :
                   This research will develop a relative Hodge theory of                     
              families of complex algebraic varieties.  More precisely, there is             
              associated to any variety a category of objects called stratified              
              variations of Hodge structure.  Given an algebraic map, the data of            
              the cohomology along the fibers together with their mixed Hodge                
              structures should give rise to such an object.  The principal                  
              investigator will examine this situation, as well as consider the              
              category of polarizable mixed Hodge structures.                                
                   This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, which is             
              one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics.  In its origin, it              
              treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest             
              equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of                
              methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology.            
              It is finding application in those areas of mathematics as well as             
              in theoretical computer science and in robotics.
