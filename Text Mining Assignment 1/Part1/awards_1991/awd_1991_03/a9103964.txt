Abstract    :
                   Many structural geometries used to determine the sense of                 
              shear in deformation zones are not well understood and cannot be               
              used to obtain shear strain magnitudes.  A computer code will be               
              developed to quantify the relative importance of rigid objects and             
              foliations to the development of shear zone fabrics.  The code will            
              simulate shearing deformation using a range of kinematic variables.            
              At each stage of the project the model predictions will be compared            
              with naturally deformed sheared rocks from well-constrained sites.             
              The results will help clarify the relationships among many                     
              structures developed in shear zones and identify practical criteria            
              for estimating shear-strain magnitude in rocks.  These findings                
              will be of practical value to structural geologists working in a               
              great numbers of different tectonic environments.
