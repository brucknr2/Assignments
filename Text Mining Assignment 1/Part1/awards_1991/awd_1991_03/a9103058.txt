Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks to elucidate the coarsening effects in                     
              miscibility-gap alloy solidification owing to thin-film                        
              effects.  The NSF funding sought will support the experimental                 
                                                                                             
              phase of a joint experimental/analytical investigation where                   
              the analytical part is being supported by NASA.  In the                        
              experimental study, the directional solidification of the                      
              succinonitrile-camphene system via video imaging through a                     
              transparent cell utilizing a gradient stage microscope                         
              facility will be done.  This will provide important                            
              information on the repulsion and capture of ultra-fine                         
              particles and droplets by advancing solidification fronts.                     
              Utilizing a Rame-Hart pendant drop apparatus, component                        
              interfacial tensions will be measured.  The data obtained will                 
                                                                                             
              be used to validate the analytical model being developed under                 
                                                                                             
              NASA funding.  In particular, validation will hinge on                         
              predictions of the critical droplet size with measurements of                  
              the largest droplets rejected by the advancing solidification                  
              front determined from the video imaging data.  This work will                  
              provide the first experimental data for droplet rejection in                   
              directional solidification.  All prior studies involved solid                  
              particle rejection.
