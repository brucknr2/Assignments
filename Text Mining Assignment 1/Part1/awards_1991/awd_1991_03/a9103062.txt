Abstract    :
              Kamchatka arc provides a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis             
              that adakites are derived from the melting of subducted oceanic                
              crust and/or lower continental crust.                                          
              The southern section of the Kamchatka arc consists of active and               
              inactive volcanoes with mantle derived magmas.  The northern                   
              section (north of the Bering F.Z.) volcanism includes both normal              
              and adakite geochemistries.  The adakites are associated only with             
              the subduction of the young crust in the Komandorsky basin.  The               
              first objective will be to compare and contrast "normal" arc                   
              volcanism in the southern section of the arc with the adakite                  
              volcanism found in the northern section.                                       
              There are several xenoliths found among the adakites including                 
              granulites, cortlandites, amphibolites, hornblendites, pyroxenites,            
              and gabbros.  The large range of xenoliths in the samples may                  
              enable the PIs to document the source of the adakites.  They will              
              use a microprobe and  an ion microprobe to document the                        
              geochemical signatures and P-T conditions of the xenoliths which               
              should make it possible to choose between the lower crust or                   
              subducted slab as the source of the adakites.
