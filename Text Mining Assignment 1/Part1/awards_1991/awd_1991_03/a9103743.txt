Abstract    :
                   A closed aspherical manifold is a compact connected manifold              
              whose universal cover is contractible.  Let M and N be closed                  
              aspherical manifolds, and let F be an isomorphism of their                     
              fundamental groups.  Borel conjectured that F is always induced                
              by a homeomorphism f of the manifolds.  The investigator, in                   
              collaboration with L. E. Jones of SUNY-Stony Brook, intends to                 
              try to settle this conjecture.  Partial results by the                         
              investigator and Jones were the main results of the previous                   
              N.S.F. grant (DMS-8801312).  The project also relates to problems              
              in differential geometry and algebraic K-theory; e.g., does Wh(G)              
              vanish for every torsion-free group G?                                         
                   Manifolds are locally Euclidean spaces, which makes them                  
              very natural objects of study.  For example, the physical world                
              in which we live has three space dimensions and (in some                       
              contexts) a time dimension, making it either a three-dimensional               
              or four-dimensional manifold.  Thus the instant project to                     
              understand better the structure of manifolds might even have                   
              cosmological significance.
