Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will conduct research in several               
              areas of stochastic differential equations.  This area of                      
              stochastic calculus is a field within probability theory which                 
              has impact on several disciplines:  electrical engineering,                    
              mathematical physics, finance and economics.  In particular, the               
              investigator will study weak convergence of stochastic integrals               
              and stochastic differential equations, with investigations into                
              numerical schemes for approximating solutions of stochastic                    
              differential equations driven by general semi-martingales.  In                 
              addition he will study a new type of forward-backward equation                 
              which arose in finance theory.  Finally, he has proposed a new                 
              type of Stratonovich stochastic differential equation for general              
              semimartingales which allows approximation of the jumping                      
              differentials by continuous processes in a Wong-Zakai manner.                  
                   The principal investigator will conduct research in several               
              areas of stochastic differential equations.  This area of                      
              stochastic calculus is a field within probability theory which                 
              has impact on several disciplines:  electrical engineering,
