Abstract    :
                   The project will involve the study of problems in "fractal                
              spectral asymptotics", i.e., the asymptotic behavior of spectral               
              expansions of objects arising in fractal geometry.  This work                  
              unites two important areas of mathematical research: harmonic                  
              analysis-spectral theory and fractal geometry.  The principal                  
              investigator has found a proto-type fractal Plancherel formula                 
              for Fourier transforms in Euclidean space, he has given a more                 
              refined analysis for self-similar fractals and he has generalized              
              the results to heat equation expansions on Riemannian manifolds.               
              The proposal research will extend this work in a number of                     
              directions.                                                                    
                   In particular, the principal investigator will obtain more                
              precise information on Fourier expansions, and he will generalize              
              his previous results to stratified nilpotent Lie groups, wavelet               
              expansions and expansions arising from boundary value problems.
