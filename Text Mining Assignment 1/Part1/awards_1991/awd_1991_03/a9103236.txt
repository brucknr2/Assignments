Abstract    :
              This proposal is an extension of the PI's previous theoretical                 
              work on the response of bone to mechanical stresses.  The intent               
              is to extend the mathematical theory to describe the changes that              
              occur at the bone-implant interface.  A computational procedure                
              known as boundary element method will be used to analyze the                   
              microstructural remodeling of bone and to determine the variation              
              in mechanical stability as a function of time.  If the theory is               
              proven correct, the work will lead to the improved design of bone              
              protheses.
