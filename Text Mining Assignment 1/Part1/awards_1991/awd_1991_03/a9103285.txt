Abstract    :
              This project concerns complexity theoretic aspects of numeric and              
              algebraic computation.                                                         
                                                                                             
              One topic is problem solving using approximate data, as occurs if the          
              actual data must be either approximated through experimentation or             
              rounded for computation.  Attempts will be made to lay some                    
              foundations for a complexity theory which incorporates approximate             
              data, in contrast to traditional complexity theory where exact                 
              rational data is required.  Some emphasis will be given to devising            
              efficient algorithms for solving certain problems using approximate            
              data, most notably linear programming problems.                                
                                                                                             
              Another topic is computational real semi-algebraic geometry, e.g.,             
              quantifier elimination methods for the first order theory of the               
              reals.  Attention will be given to a few well-known open problems in           
              this area as well as to the common ground between it and numeric               
              computation.  This common ground is a natural place to build a general         
              theory of condition numbers as well as to study extensions of standard         
              problems in numeric computation such as solution approximation.
