Abstract    :
              This research will focus on interactions of phospholipases A1, A2,             
              and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C(PI-PLC) with                 
              lipid membrane systems.  These enzymes play key roles in the                   
              production of bioactive lipids (prostaglandins, leukotrienes,                  
              platelet activating factor), in signal transduction across                     
              membranes, and the release of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored            
              proteins from membranes.  Major points to be addressed are the                 
              mechanisms of action, substrate specificities, interactions with               
              lipid interfaces, and the nature of the activation by the lipid                
              interface.  Kinetics will be studied using thiolester substrate                
              analogs in continuous spectrophotometric assay systems with mixed-             
              micelles of detergent and substrate, with vesicles of anionic                  
              phospholipids, and in monolayer systems.  Protein-lipid                        
              interactions will be studied by fluorescence spectroscopy, and by              
              penetration of proteins into monolayers of non-hydrolyzable                    
              phospholipids.  The kinetics of recombinant PI-PLC from Bacillus               
              cereus will be studied in micellar systems using a continuous                  
              spectrophotometric assay with thiophosphate ester substrate                    
              analogs.  Minimal substrate requirements will be determined.  A                
              comparison of phosphoinositide phosphotransferase (production of               
              inositol 1,2-cyclophosphate) and inositol 1,2-cyclophosphate                   
              phosphohydrolase (production of inositol-1phosphate) activities                
              will be made.  Recombinant hepatic lipase (phospholipase A1) and               
              mutants (at the putative lipid-binding and active sites), and                  
              recombinant placental phospholipase A2 will also be studied. //
