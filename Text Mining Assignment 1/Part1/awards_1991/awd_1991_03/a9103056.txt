Abstract    :
                   This project spans a variety of fields in ergodic theory.                 
              Professor Bergelson will concentrate on the study of multiple                  
              recurrence and mixing in dynamical systems.  The problems to be                
              researched are closely related to combinatorics and number theory.             
              Professor Rosenblatt research will be in the area of almost                    
              everywhere convergence of various averaging methods.  This award               
              will also support Dr. Ward, a postdoctoral researcher.  His work               
              involves the relationship between positive entropy, mixing of all              
              orders, exponential recurrence, and the action of the integer                  
              lattice on compact groups.                                                     
                   Because dynamical systems can display extremely complicated,              
              even chaotic behavior, it is impossible to follow the time                     
              development of such a system in complete detail.  Ergodic theory               
              involves methods of studying certain average properties of these               
              systems which contain enough information to nevertheless be useful.
