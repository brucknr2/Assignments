Abstract    :
                   Set theory underlies all of mathematics.  The two main avenues            
              to laying the foundations of set theory rely either on axioms                  
              postulating large cardinal numbers or on various axioms about the              
              determinacy of so-called set theoretic games.                                  
                   Woodin will investigate the relationship between large                    
              cardinals and determinacy, descriptive set theory in the context of            
              determinacy, and the possibilities for the definability of the                 
              well-ordering of the reals in the presence of very large cardinals.            
              He also intends to investigate the global structure of the Turing              
              degrees and of more general degree structures.  The basic question             
              concerns rigidity.
