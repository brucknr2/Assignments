Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Proposed is a one day symposium on "Neuropeptides:  Synthesis,                 
              Release, Action and Evolution" at the annual meeting of the                    
              American Society of Zoologist (ASZ), December 27-31, 1991,                     
              sponsored by the Division of Comparative Physiology and                        
              Biochemistry and co-sponsored by the Division of Comparative                   
              Endocrinology.  The Symposium is designed to bring to comparative              
              biologists who work with a diverse array of organisms, some of the             
              new insights and approaches now being used to elucidate the mode               
              of action of neuropeptides and the roles that they play in the                 
              regulation of physiological processes.  The topics will include the            
              evolution and roles of neuropeptide families, genetic approaches               
              to neuropeptide synthesis, neuropeptide processing and release                 
              (including evolution of release sites), conformation and regulation            
              of neuropeptide receptors, and neurophysiological and behavioral               
              actions of neuropeptides.  Both invertebrate and vertebrate model              
              systems will be discussed.  The 10 speakers include both                       
              established and young investigators.  The highlights of the                    
              Symposium will be summarized by the organizers and published in the            
              American Zoologist.//
