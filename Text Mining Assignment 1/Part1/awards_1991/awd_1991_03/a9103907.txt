Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal involves use of small angle neutron scattering                   
              techniques to allow for measurements of the bacterial cell wall                
              (murein sacculus) undere conditions where it (at least) approaches             
              its native state of being fully hydrated.  Determinations of the               
              thickness of the E. coli cell wall at lateral vs. polar cell                   
              regions, the thickness of the wall at stationary vs. exponential               
              growth phase, and the number of murein layers should lead to needed            
              insights as to just how such cells increase the size of their                  
              sacculi, and thus enlarge our understanding of basic aspects of                
              growth and morphogenesis of these and other bacteria.   //
