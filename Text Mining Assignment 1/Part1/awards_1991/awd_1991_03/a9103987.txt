Abstract    :
                   Professor Carey will continue his work in operator theory                 
              concerning principal currents, local index, and Fredholm                       
              reciprocity in multivariable spectral theory.  For operator rings              
              of type II, this work involves relationships between determinant               
              theory in operator algebras and plurisubharmonic functions.                    
                   This project concerns Hilbert space operators which can be                
              thought of as infinite matrices of complex numbers.  Professor                 
              Carey's project will focus on a more geometric way of looking at               
              these operators.  The ultimate goal is to be able to classify and              
              obtain a deeper understanding of large families of these objects,              
              for they are important in almost all branches of pure and applied              
              mathematics.
