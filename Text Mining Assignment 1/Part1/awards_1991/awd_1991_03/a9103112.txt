Abstract    :
              This is joint work with Dr. Vladimir Lifschitz, at the University              
              of Texas, Austin.  The goal of this research is to develop, study              
              and implement formalisms for representing properties of actions                
              in declarative extensions of logic programming.  The theoretical               
              part of the project is based on the mathematical theory of                     
              nonmonotonic reasoning.  The experimental part uses deductive                  
              database systems.  The specific aims are (1) to develop methods                
              for representing properties of actions using both negation as                  
              failure and classical negation, and to study their relation to                 
              the representations based on circumscription and other                         
              nonmonotonic formalisms, (2) to implement these representations                
              using deductive database systems, (3) to extend this work to the               
              models of action that include continuous time and concurrency,                 
              (4) to investigate the possibility of using abductive logic                    
              programming for the automation of reasoning about the past.
