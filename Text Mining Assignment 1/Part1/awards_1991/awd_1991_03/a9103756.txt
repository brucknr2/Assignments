Abstract    :
                   A fundamental question for pre-Cambrian tectonics is the                  
              timing and amounts of extraction of crustal material from the                  
              mantle and its addition to the crust.  However, it has been                    
              difficult to distinguish new additions from recycled older crustal             
              material.  This project will employ isotopic technique to establish            
              Nd-model ages and fix the time since the parental material of the              
              rocks separated from the earth's mantle.  Coupled with U-Pb ages,              
              these data will allow the estimation of new materials to the                   
              Northeastern Appalachians during late proterozoic time (1300-1000              
              Ma).
