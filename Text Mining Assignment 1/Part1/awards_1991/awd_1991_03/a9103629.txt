Abstract    :
                      This effort is to drop expendable probes to measure the                
              velocity gradient in the upper ocean at sufficiently high                      
              resolution to describe the shear field responsible for the                     
              generation of ocean mixing and turbulence.  The work will be done              
              of an Australian vessel in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.                  
              The results will be related to the evolving theories relating                  
              shear on small scales to the level of dissipation and therefore,               
              mixing.
