Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The overall objective of this research is to provide further                   
              understanding of the mechanism controlling renin secretion at the              
              intracellular level.  The relevant techniques for initiating this              
              project have been developed and used in Dr. Fray's laboratory.                 
              Recent evidence suggests that renin granules and plasma membrane               
              contain key molecules which are regulated in the renin secretory               
              process.  The specific aims of this project are:  1) to isolate                
              juxtaglomerular cells and determine their renin content; 2) to                 
              isolate renin-containing granules, determine their renin content               
              and compare their renin responsiveness to several factors which                
              stimulate renin secretion; and 3) to isolate plasma membrane                   
              vesicles from juxtaglomerular cells and compare their storage,                 
              release and transport capabilities in response to several factors              
              known to stimulate renin secretion.  These studies will shed light             
              on the cellular mechanism of renin release.//
