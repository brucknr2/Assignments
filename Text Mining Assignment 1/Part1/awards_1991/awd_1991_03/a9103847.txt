Abstract    :
              This award supports collaborative activities in physics                        
              research between U.S. and Latin American physicists.  There                    
              are three principal investigators: Leon Lederman, President                    
              of AAAS, Leo Falicov of the University of California at                        
              Berkeley and Roy Rubinstein at Fermilab.  The award will                       
              foster international research collaboration and the interchange                
              of scientific information among scientists and engineers in                    
              the U.S. and several Latin American countries.  It will                        
              provide funds for attendance at conferences, to support                        
              workshops, for journal subscriptions and to have access to                     
              experimental materials.                                                        
                                                                                             
              These funds for such activities will be catalytic support to                   
              qualified scientists in Latin America to help them to                          
              contribute effectively to international and thus to U.S.                       
              science.  Clearly this kind of support will have a direct and                  
              positive effect on the infrastructure of Latin American                        
              physics.  Thus the mutual benefit to the U.S. and Latin                        
              America is evident and the goals of the Science in Developing                  
              Countries program will be fulfilled.
