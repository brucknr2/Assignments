Abstract    :
              A group of about 20 organic chemists will be selected to                       
              receive travel assistance to attend the Sixth IUPAC Symposium                  
              on Organometallic Chemistry directed towards Organic Synthesis                 
              in Utrecht, the Netherlands which will be held August 25-29,                   
              1991.  The U. S. chemists will present technical talks and have                
              the opportunity to interact with specialists from all over the                 
              world.  The possibility of travel support will be advertised                   
              and the applications will be reviewed by a panel of scientists.                
              Professional and geographic factors will be considered in the                  
              final selection of participants.  This travel grant is being                   
              funded by the Organic Synthesis Program.
