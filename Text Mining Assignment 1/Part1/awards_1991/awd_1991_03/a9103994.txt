Abstract    :
              Dr. David VanVranken has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                  
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. VanVranken's doctoral degree was                 
              from Stanford University under the supervision of Professor                    
              Barry Trost. Dr. VanVranken intends to continue his research at                
              the University of California at Berkeley under the sponsorship                 
              of Professor Peter Schultz. The postdoctoral experience will                   
              train him in antibody catalysis, protein modification via                      
              site-directed mutagenesis, and protein and antibody structure                  
              and modification. Longer term, he plans to develop antibody                    
              catalysts for the cleavage and transfer of phosphate esters.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new PH.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
