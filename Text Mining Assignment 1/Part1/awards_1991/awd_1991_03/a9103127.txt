Abstract    :
              Elliptic boundary value problems occur in many                                 
              disciplines.  In cases where the boundaries are                                
              complex and irregular, these problems are recast as                            
              integral equations and solved by boundary integral                             
              equation methods.  This technique requires the                                 
              solution of a linear system.  In many problems of                              
              practical interest these systems are large enough                              
              that the computational effort required for their                               
              solution is prohibitive.  In recent years, vector                              
              supercomputers have expanded the range of                                      
              problems which may be solved numerically but                                   
              there remains a significant number of problems                                 
              which lie beyond current capabilities.  The                                    
              combination of parallel supercomputers and                                     
              powerful iterative methods holds the promise of                                
              expanding the territory of solvable problems.  This                            
              SGER project addresses both aspects of this                                    
              combination.  An O(N) algorithm which was                                      
              recently implemented on serial and vector machines                             
              will be implemented on a parallel architecture, and                            
              the existing repertoire of iterative methods will be                           
              expanded to uniquely augment the power of the                                  
              O(N) algorithm.
