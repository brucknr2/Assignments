Abstract    :
              A joint theoretical and experimental study will be made of defects             
              in materials.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigations will            
              be carried out in amorphous semiconductors, hydrogen-metal systems,            
              and in very small samples at high pressures.  The NMR measurements             
              will be correlated with studies via infrared spectroscopy, electron            
              scattering, mass spectrometry, electrical conductivity, etc.  A                
              principle goal is to examine the role of hydrogen rearrangements in            
              changing the properties of amorphous semiconductors and metallic               
              alloys.  The theoretical work still include first principles                   
              molecular dynamics simulations of large supercells of amorphous                
              silicon, hydrogenated amorphous silicon, and amorphous silicon with            
              a range of dopants.  These experimental and theoretical studies are            
              intended to provide information that will allow a microscopic                  
              understanding of degradations of photovoltaic properties which                 
              accompany exposure to light of a dark-annealed amorphous                       
              hydrogenated silicon film.  These degradations currently limit the             
              wide commercial usage of hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar                  
              cells.
