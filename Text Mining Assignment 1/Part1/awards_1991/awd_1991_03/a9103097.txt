Abstract    :
              Structural biologists have been triggered to evaluate their                    
              current and future needs for synchrotron radiation by                          
              construction of new facilities at Argonne and at Berkeley.  At a               
              time when major requests will be submitted for funding of new                  
              instrumentation, it has become apparent that scant documentation               
              exists on either the current or future needs of the structural                 
              biology community for synchrotron radiation.  The Structural                   
              Biology Synchrotron Users Organization proposes to conduct an                  
              intensive, two-day workshop in order to document and assess these              
              resources and needs and to advise the National Science Foundation              
              in its role as sponsor of structural biology research.  The                    
              proposed study group would 1) analyze data gathered from                       
              synchrotron users and synchrotron facilities that describe                     
              current resources and needs; 2) evaluate how scientific                        
              developments in the fields of genetic engineering, low-angle                   
              scattering, X-ray spectroscopy, x-ray microscopy,                              
              crystallography, computational technology, and instrument                      
              development affect structural biology today; 3) project future                 
              demand and capabilities; and 4) produce a document detailing                   
              these findings.  The document, reviewed by major scientists in                 
              these fields, would be available to funding organizations,                     
              government bodies and the scientific community to facilitate                   
              planning for the future.
