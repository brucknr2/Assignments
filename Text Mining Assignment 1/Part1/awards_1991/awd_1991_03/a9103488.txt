Abstract    :
              This is a request for partial support of a conference "Regulation              
              of Eukaryotic mRNA Transcription"  to be held at Cold Spring Harbor            
              Laboratories, New York from August 28-Sept. 1, 1991. The meeting               
              will bring together scientists of all ages working with many                   
              different organisms and cell types in an atmosphere conducive to               
              intellectual interaction.                                                      
                                                                                             
              In the past, this meeting has been enthusiastically received by the            
              scientific community and it is expected that the enthusiasm                    
              generated this year will be at the same high level.***
