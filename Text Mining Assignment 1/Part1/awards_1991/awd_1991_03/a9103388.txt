Abstract    :
                  The Principal Investigator will attack two research problems               
              dealing with convective systems over the Amazon basin.  The first              
              is an attempt at estimation of evapotranspiration using                        
              satellite-based techniques.  Evapotranspiration in the rain                    
              forest is an important component of the hydrologic cycle, but is               
              inadequately understood in this region.  This portion of the                   
              research is a continuation of work begun under a previous award.               
                  The second objective is to investigate the characteristics of              
              convection and compare these to environmental conditions.  While               
              this has been done extensively in North America, similar studies               
              have been lacking in South America.  Such contrasting studies are              
              useful for understanding the important physical factors for                    
              convection on both sides of the equator.  The PI will use a                    
              combination of ground-based and satellite data in this research.//
