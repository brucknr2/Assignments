Abstract    :
                The traditional story of the Scientific Revolution of the                    
              seventeenth century is currently undergoing extensive revision,                
              with some arguing that the concept of a scientific revolution                  
              in the seventeenth century should be abandoned altogether.  A                  
              study of the early work on mathematical probability theory of                  
              Jacob Bernoulli, a professor at Basel, Switzerland, his nephew                 
              Nicolaus Bernoulli, who taught at the University of Padua, and                 
              their relations to John Bernoulli, Jacob's brother, who worked                 
              at Groningen, in Holland, can help to shed a new perspective                   
              on seventeenth century scientific developments.  The largest                   
              part of the research will concern early mathematical                           
              probability theory and its social context.  There will also be                 
              consideration of proposed new interpretations of what happened                 
              in seventeenth century science from the feminist perspective.                  
                The project is expected to provide new insights about the                    
              scientific revolution.  It furthers VPW program objectives to                  
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              science or engineering through research, and to encourage other                
              women to pursue careers in these areas through the                             
              investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the host                  
              campuses.  In this project, the proposed activities which                      
              contribute to the second objective include:  teaching a course                 
              on the Scientific Revolution and/or a course on the history of                 
              women in science, through which the investigator will examine                  
              and test new feminist interpretations against the evidence; and                
              participating in the support activities of the Douglass Project                
              for Rutgers Women in Math, Science, and Engineering.
