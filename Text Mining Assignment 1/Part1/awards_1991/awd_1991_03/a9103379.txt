Abstract    :
                     Three areas of computationaly efficient algorithms for  design of IC's
              are under investigation.  1.     Algorithms for display of VLSI artwork:
              Sequential and  parallel algorithms to quickly display collections of polygons 
              and lines on popular display devices are being investigated.  2.     When a
              VLSI design can be modeled by graphs, it is often  required to split or delete
              a set of vertices so that the  resulting graph will satisfy design criteria. 
              Classes of graphs  for which the problems are polynomially solvable and methods
              for  minimizing the number of components in the resulting digraph are  being
              determined.  3.     Module orientation and rotation problems for a variety of 
              design styles are being examined to determine which are NP-hard  and
              polynomially solvable.  Approximation algorithms, heuristics,  and polynomial
              algorithms are being developed for the NP-hard  problems.
