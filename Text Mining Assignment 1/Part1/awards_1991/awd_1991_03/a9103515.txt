Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University                
              will purchase computer workstations, a compute/file server, and                
              graphics equipment which will be dedicated to support research in              
              the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for                     
              several research projects, including in particular: Estimation                 
              and Inference for Noisy Chaotic Systems, Exact Conditional Tests               
              for Contingency Tables, Numerical Methods for Bayesian Analysis,               
              Inference in the Presence of Nuisance Parameters, and                          
              Probabilistic Neural Firing Models.
