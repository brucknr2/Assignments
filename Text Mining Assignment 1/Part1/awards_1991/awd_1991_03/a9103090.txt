Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An international workshop, "The Measurement of Dissolved                       
              Organic Carbon in Natural Waters," will be convened in late                    
              spring of 1991 to critically compare currently available                       
              methods for the quantification of DOC in natural waters.                       
              Specifically, this workshop will address recent evidence that                  
              high-temperature catalytic oxidation (HTCO) techniques measure                 
              a major component of DOC in natural waters that is not                         
              quantified by conventional UV/persulfate (UV/PP methods.  The                  
              main goals of the workshop will be to:  (1) define consistent                  
              trends among DOC measurements by HTCO versus UV/P and other                    
              methods (based both on existing data and results for a small                   
              set of representative samples analyzed by workshop                             
              participants; (2) critically evaluate procedures for                           
              collecting, processing and preserving water samples for DOC                    
              analysis; (3) identify possible mechanisms for consistent                      
              differences in DOC measurements (as they relate both to                        
              handling and analytical methodology; and (4) recommend                         
              guidelines for future research on problems related to accurate                 
              DOC quantification as well as interim procedures for DOC                       
              measurements in ongoing field studies.  Considerations will                    
              also be given to that analogous measurement of dissolved                       
              organic nitrogen.
