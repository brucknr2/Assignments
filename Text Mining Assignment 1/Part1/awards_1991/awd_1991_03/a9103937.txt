Abstract    :
              This project will focus on problems of multiple instance combinatorial         
              optimization, particularly two types of multiple instance network flow         
              and cut problems, and combinatorial problems that are solved by such           
              multiple instance computations.  Many non-trivial combinatorial                
              problems are solved by solving a sequence of network flow or minimum           
              cut problems, where each successive problem instance differs from its          
              predecessor in a highly structured way.  The similarity of the problem         
              instances allows the sequence to be solved much more efficiently than          
              by solving each instance independently.  This project will                     
              concentrate on multiple instance network flow and minimum cut                  
              problems that are generated either by changing the choice of source            
              and sink nodes, or by systematically changing edge capacities.  An             
              important approach to these problems is to understand the structure of         
              the set of solutions to the space of all problem instances that might          
              be encountered in the sequence, and to use this structural                     
              understanding to efficiently represent, in some compact implicit form,         
              the set of solutions to all potential instances.  Then once a                  
              particular instance is specified, it can be expanded and retrieved             
              from the representation faster than by solving the instance from               
              scratch.  Hence a large part of the project is directed towards                
              developing such structural understanding and compact representations.
