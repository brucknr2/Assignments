Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research activity are, firstly, to develop              
              some very general, all purpose, algorithms to help study groups                
              given by generators and defining relations; secondly, to compile               
              computer-generated libraries of examples, references and the                   
              like, pertaining to the general subject Combinatorial Group                    
              Theory; and thirdly to provide a vehicle for the dissemination of              
              new results and advances in the field.  In the main, the program               
              that will be developed will be designed to provide information                 
              about a wide variety of properties of groups.                                  
                                                                                             
              Combinatorial Group Theory is an important in abstract algebra,                
              and with close connections to topology, logic and wide variety of              
              other disciplines as well. Its study leads to a deeper                         
              understanding of structures underlying many aspects of science.
