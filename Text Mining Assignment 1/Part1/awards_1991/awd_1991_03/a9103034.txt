Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A comparative analysis of eastern boundary currents using                      
              previously collected data on flow and hydrography is proposed.                 
              Emphasis will be on the large scale and long-term variability. A               
              synthesis of many previous experiments will result allowing                    
              broader conclusions about eastern boundary systems.
