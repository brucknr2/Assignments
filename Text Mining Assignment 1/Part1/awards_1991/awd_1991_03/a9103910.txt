Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will study                     
              several problems in the geometry of functions of a complex                     
              variable.  One of his major goals is to find simple geometric                  
              conditions that can be used to determine if a domain in Euclidean              
              space supports the Poincare inequality.  This work has                         
              applications to the study of boundary value problems for partial               
              differential equations, and it would provide information on the                
              geometry of univalent mappings of a disk.  The principal                       
              investigator will also study the influence of differentiation on               
              the distribution of zeros of entire functions and problems                     
              involving the integrability of harmonic functions.                             
                   Many problems involving the properties of functions of a                  
              complex variable can be studied from a geometric point of view,                
              since such functions are, after all, mappings of the Euclidean                 
              plane into itself.  In this project the principal investigator                 
              will use various geometric ideas to study problems in complex                  
              variables that relate to the solvability of boundary value                     
              problems, the properties of univalent mappings of a disk and the               
              integrability of harmonic functions.
