Abstract    :
                   The central limit theorem is the most fundamental result in               
              mathematical statistics.  It states that the partial sums of a                 
              sequence of independent identically distributed random variables               
              with finite variance can be normalized so that they converge in                
              distribution to a normal law.  In the case of infinite variance,               
              convergence is still possible, and the limit is either normal or               
              a nonnormal stable law.  For random vectors it is known that                   
              similar results hold, but there does not yet exist a practical                 
              method for construction of the norming operators.  The principal               
              investigator intends to develop such a method.  This work will                 
              bring the existing theoretical results on multivariable                        
              generalizations of the central limit theorem one step closer to                
              practical applications.                                                        
                   The principal investigator will work in the area of                       
              mathematics concerning limits of random vectors.  This research                
              is in the center of the field of probability and mathematical                  
              statistics.  The principal investigator is working at a small,                 
              liberal arts college, and this award is being made via the                     
              Research in Undergraduate Institutions program.
