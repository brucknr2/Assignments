Abstract    :
                   The Fellow will test for the presence of lithospheric roots               
              beneath Archean cratons in the southern African subcontinent by (1)            
              investigating crustal and upper mantle seismic velocities, (2)                 
              determining earthquake source depths, and (3) integrating new                  
              seismic observations with existing seismic, gravity, heat flow and             
              petrologic observations into a unified model.  The Fellow will work            
              at the Pennsylvania State University during his tenure.
