Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to ssek funds for the support of an            
              International Symposium which is entitled "Physics and Chemistry of            
              Finite Systems - From Clusters to Crystals" to be held in Richmond,            
              Virginia October 8-12, 1991.  The conference will focus on                     
              structural and electronic properties of clusters, nano-scale                   
              particles, and quasicrystals with the emphasis on particles                    
              composed of metallic elements.  Contributions from the physics,                
              chemistry, and materials science communities will stress the                   
              interdisciplinary aspects of these emerging fields.  Applications              
              of these fields in designing atomically engineered materials will              
              be included.
