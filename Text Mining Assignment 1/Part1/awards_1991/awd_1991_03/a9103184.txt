Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will study three               
              conjectures related to the embedding of CR manifolds in complex                
              Euclidean space.  The first conjecture involves embedding a                    
              smooth, compact, pseudoconvex CR manifold.  The second conjecture              
              involves embedding a neighborhood of a point of a smoothly                     
              bounded, integrable, almost complex manifold at which a Levi form              
              has at least two negative eigenvalues.  The third conjecture                   
              involves embedding a relatively compact, open set in a Stein                   
              manifold in an affine algebraic variety.                                       
                   The subject of several complex variables has deep and                     
              important ties with the geometry of n-space.  Mathematicians can               
              often exploit these connections in their study of classical                    
              problems in the theory of several complex variables.  In this                  
              project the principal investigator will attempt to answer three                
              important conjectures regarding whether various types of                       
              manifolds can be embedded in complex Euclidean space.
