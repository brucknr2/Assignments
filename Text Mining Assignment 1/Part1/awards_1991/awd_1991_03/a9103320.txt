Abstract    :
                Knowledge of the distribution and potential availability of                  
              mineral resources in the ground is fundamental to many                         
              political and investment decisions that will be made, placing                  
              economic geology at the interface between science and society.                 
              This study propose to examine the effects of recent political                  
              changes on the economic importance of non-fuel mineral                         
              resources in the affairs of both developed and developing                      
              countries.  Mineral endowment trends in substitution and                       
              recycling, and policy strategies are preeminent concerns.                      
              Procedure will entail consultation with international scholars                 
              in political science, mineral economics, history, and geology,                 
              in addition to archival research.                                              
                Results of this study should provide guidance both for                       
              resource policy decisions and for ore deposit research.  The                   
              project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                             
              opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                 
              engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                  
              pursue careers in these areas through the investigators'                       
              enhanced visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In                   
              this effort, the proposed activities which contribute to the                   
              second objective include:  developing and teaching a course on                 
              minerals and world affairs; presenting a seminar on science and                
              policy, giving lectures on a scientist's role in government;                   
              and serving as a counselor and mentor to students.
