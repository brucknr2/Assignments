Abstract    :
                This grant is to support the travel of two U.S. graduate students            
              to the U.S.S.R., and the travel of two Soviet graduate students to             
              the U.S. as a supplement to a Soviet-American Senior Scientist                 
              exchange funded by the National Academy of Sciences and the                    
              Akademia Nauk.  The purpose of the exchange grant is to compare                
              state-of-the-art techniques in paleoseismology, a critical tool for            
              the evaluation of the seismic hazard of active faults.  Fault                  
              trenching will be done in Utah and in the Baikal rift zone of the              
              U.S.S.R.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake              
              Hazard Reduction Program.
