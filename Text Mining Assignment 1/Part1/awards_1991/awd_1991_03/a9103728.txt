Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the higher Chow groups of                  
              algebraic varieties over various fields.  The principal                        
              investigator will study the kernel of the Albanese map for a                   
              smooth, projective surface over various fields.  He will also                  
              consider the question of computing the torsion subgroup of CH2(X)              
              when this is known to be finite.                                               
                   This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics.  In its origins, it                    
              treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the                      
              simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field                   
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but analysis and                   
              topology.  It is finding application in those fields as well as                
              in theoretical computer science and robotics.
