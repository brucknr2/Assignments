Abstract    :
                   The Fellow will study the relationship between macroscopic                
              mineral reactivity and microscopic mechanisms of interfacial                   
              reactions.  Such studies are now possible with the availability of             
              techniques of accurately measuring the kinetics of surface                     
              controlled interfacial reactions and the recent development of in-             
              situ spectroscopic and microscopic technologies.  The mineral                  
              reactivities observed in geologic systems, coupled with microscopic            
              surface processes, can lead to fuller understanding of mineral                 
              solution systems in weathering, pollutant migration and geochemical            
              cycling of the elements.  The Fellow will work at Stanford                     
              University during the tenure period.
