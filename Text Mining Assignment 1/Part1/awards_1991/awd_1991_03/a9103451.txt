Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the development of software                     
              implementing new matrix decomposition algorithms which have been               
              formulated for solving the systems of linear algebraic equations               
              arising when orthogonal spline collocation (that is, spline                    
              collocation at Gauss points) is applied to certain separable, second           
              order, linear problems on rectangular regions.  Two classes of                 
              algorithms will be examined.  In the first, the approximate solution           
              is a piecewise Hermite bicubic defined on a uniform mesh, while the            
              second provides approximations of arbitrarily high order on nonuniform         
              partitions.  The new algorithms, which are modular and possess a great         
              deal of natural parallelism,  also have application in the solution of         
              nonseparable boundary value problems, problems on general regions, and         
              time dependent problems.  The new software will be written in Fortran          
              and developed for use on various shared memory machines.
