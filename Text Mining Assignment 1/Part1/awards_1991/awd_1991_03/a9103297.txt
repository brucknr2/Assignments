Abstract    :
                   The problems addressed in this research project are in the                
              area of differential topology.  Their common theme is to develop               
              relations between the geometry and topology of group actions and               
              foliations, their cohomology invariants, and the analytic                      
              invariants of differential operators naturally associated with                 
              their geometry.  Steven Hurder will work on rigidity of Anosov                 
              actions of "large" groups; on the "topology-at-infinity" of open               
              manifolds, based on K-theory invariants of differential                        
              operators; on the classifications of low-dimensional Anosov                    
              diffeomorphisms, using secondary classes and moduli spaces for                 
              quasi-symmetric maps; and on the spectrum of elliptic operators                
              on leaves of foliations, using the dynamics of the geodesic flow               
              of the foliation.                                                              
                   This collection of problems concerns natural objects,                     
              manifolds, i.e. locally Euclidean geometric spaces.  The                       
              properties dealt with are such things as symmetry of these                     
              objects and flows defined on them, all to be investigated by a                 
              variety of techniques from algebra and analysis.
