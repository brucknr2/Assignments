Abstract    :
                The investigator will develop statistical methods for testing                
              for patterns in multilinear models, methods applicable even                    
              when the parameters of the patterned model cannot be                           
              identified.  Statistical methodology for incorporating                         
              nonparametric smoothing and covariates when several vectors are                
              measured on each subject will also be developed.  Detailed real                
              examples will be analyzed to illustrate the methods and                        
              demonstrate their applicability.                                               
                The fitting of a low-rank model to a three-way data array                    
              containing noise is an active area of research with important                  
              applications in chemometrics and psychometrics.  The project                   
              furthers VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for                   
              women to advance their careers in science or engineering                       
              through research, and to encourage other women to pursue                       
              careers in these areas through the investigators' enhanced                     
              visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In this                       
              project, the proposed activities which contribute to the second                
              objective include:  actively participating in and giving                       
              lectures for the Biostatistics Workshop (a joint enterprise                    
              between the Department of Statistics and the School of Medicine                
              which meets twice weekly during the Fall Quarter); giving                      
              lectures on her research to the Statistics Department's faculty                
              and graduate students as part of a biweekly lecture series;                    
              participating in the Department's program of collaborative                     
              research with active research scientists from around the                       
              University; and meeting with undergraduate majors to discuss                   
              career opportunities in Statistics.
