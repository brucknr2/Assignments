Abstract    :
                   Regression diagnostics and robust procedures are two areas                
              in statistics that have exhibited rapid growth in the last                     
              decade.Diagnostic procedures for judging fits of models fitted by              
              robust procedures will be investigated.                                        
                   Properties of residuals from models fitted by R and M                     
              estimates, bounded influence GR and GM estimates, and high                     
              breakdown estimates, will all be studied.  Graphical procedures                
              for assessing the fit will be also developed.
