Abstract    :
                   This work in theoretical nuclear structure physics will                   
              carry out research on an improved calculation of an effective                  
              shell-model interaction; configuration mixing within the IBM2                  
              model to address shape coexistence, superdeformation and F-                    
              spin analog states in nuclei; and tests of fundamental                         
              symmetry violations in compound-nuclear reactions.
