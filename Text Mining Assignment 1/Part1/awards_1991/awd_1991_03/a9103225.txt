Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Hochstrasser will study ultrafast                   
              molecular dynamics in condensed phases using femtosecond laser                 
              pulses to obtain spectra in the visible and infrared.  Energy                  
              flow in molecules which are subject to collisions in a liquid                  
              and the flow of the energy out of the molecule into the                        
              surroundings are the subject of these experiments.  Three areas                
              of study are torsional relaxation of polyenes, proton transfer                 
              reactions, and reactive and nonreactive vibrational relaxation.                
              The collisionally induced processes are examined in the liquid                 
              phase on the time scale of collisions themselves.

              The study of the transformation of energetically excited                       
              molecules in condensed phases from one molecular isomeric                      
              configuration to another will significantly expand our                         
              knowledge of how a complex molecule undergoes internal                         
              rearrangements and how these are mediated by a surrounding                     
              solvent.
