Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project's aims are to focus on the novel cyclic glucans                   
              produced by Bradyrhizobium, a group of legume-nodulating bacteria              
              involved in symbiotic dinitrogen fixation.  Detailed structural                
              characterization of the glucans, elucidation of the mechanisms of              
              biosynthesis, assessment of their potentials in regulating osmotic             
              adaptation, and as inducers of phenylpropanoid metabolism will be              
              undertaken.  These studies should enlarge our understanding of the             
              roles played by these molecules in the free-living bacteria and                
              during the process of leguminous plant nodulation.
