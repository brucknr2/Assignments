Abstract    :
              Working with Dr. John Beatty of the University of Minnesota, Dr.               
              Swetlitz is seeking to delineate the historical factors responsible            
              for the public controversy between Julian Huxley and Theodosius                
              Dobzhansky regarding the definition of "fitness" in the early                  
              1960s.  This controversy reflected important social factors shaping            
              the meaning and defense of key concepts in post-World War II                   
              evolutionary biology:  efforts by geneticists to distance "fitness"            
              from eugenic considerations, the rise of population genetics as the            
              central field in evolutionary biology, and reactions in opposition             
              to both of these developments.  This research will contribute to               
              a number of areas of scholarship within the history and philosophy             
              of biology including the growing literatures on the evolutionary               
              synthesis, the relationship between genetics and society, and on               
              Huxley and Dobzhansky in particular.  It will also complement the              
              philosophical literature by emphasizing the historical                         
              contingencies that affect how terms take on meaning.
