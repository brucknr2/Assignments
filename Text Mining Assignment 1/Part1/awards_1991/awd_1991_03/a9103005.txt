Abstract    :
              This grant is to investigate and develop a working                             
              example of a new class of signal channel                                       
              demultiplexers that are intended for use in fiber                              
              optic communication systems.  The proposed                                     
              demultiplexers employ the dynamics of                                          
              photorefractive elements to separate the channels                              
              through a competitive interaction among modes of                               
              a collection of ring oscillators.  The most                                    
              remarkable property of the proposed systems is                                 
              their ability to separate channels through a self-                             
              organizing process: unlike most other techniques,                              
              these optical circuits need to "know" very little                              
              about the incoming signals; in particular, one need                            
              not specify or know the frequency (or wavelength)                              
              of the incoming optical channels.  By their very                               
              nature, the photorefractive circuits will tend to                              
              track drifts in the frequency of the signal source.                            
              They furthermore can accommodate spatial                                       
              information and may therefore be applied to                                    
              multimode fiber communication systems.
