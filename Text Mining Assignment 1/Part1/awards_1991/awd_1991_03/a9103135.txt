Abstract    :
              Optimal parallel algorithms are those whose total work                         
              (total number of operations) matches the serial complexity of the              
              problem, corresponding to optimal (often linear) time sequential               
              algorithms.  The recent trend of designing fast and processor-                 
              efficient algorithms has produced important new parallel techniques            
              and paradigms.  The main goal in this research is to pursue a research         
              effort in this direction with a particular emphasis on a sample of             
              specific problems in arithmetic computations, graph theory, and VLSI           
              routing.
