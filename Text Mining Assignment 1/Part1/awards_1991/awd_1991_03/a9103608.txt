Abstract    :
                   This project supports research in several areas of algebra and            
              number theory.  One principal investigator will study the analytic             
              and geometric construction of lattices of Lie groups.  Another                 
              principal investigator will investigate analytic and number                    
              theoretic questions with particular emphasis on L-functions of                 
              automorphic forms.  The third principal investigator will develop              
              invariant theory in order to apply it to the study of explicit                 
              structure of infinite dimensional representations of semisimple Lie            
              groups.  The postdoctoral associate will study several questions               
              about representations of groups over local fields with a view                  
              toward applying these results to L-functions and automorphic forms.            
                   This is a broad research program centered around the theory of            
              Lie groups.  The applications will be in geometry, number theory               
              and physics.
