Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at the University of Arizona will                 
              purchase UNIX workstations for research in the mathematical                    
              sciences.                                                                      
              The equipment will be used for several research projects, including            
              in particular:                                                                 
                                                                                             
              1) Group Sequential Methods for Clinical Trials;                               
                                                                                             
              2) Spatial Spread of Epidemics and Their Control;                              
                                                                                             
              3) Critical Values for Markov Random Field Percolation.
