Abstract    :
                   Professor Rumely will work on sectional capacity for adelic               
              sets on projective varieties of arbitrary dimensions.  He will                 
              develop properties of sectional capacity and attempt to prove the              
              homogeneous form conjecture that on a variety of dimension d, the              
              sectional capacity is determined by a homogeneous form of degree               
              d+1.                                                                           
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
