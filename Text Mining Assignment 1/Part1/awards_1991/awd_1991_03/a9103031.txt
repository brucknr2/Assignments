Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new Materials Research Group is established to investigate                   
              surface kinetic processes such as adsorbate diffusion, faceting,               
              crystal growth, and etching by explicitly addressing the role of               
              surface steps in these processes.  The experimental techniques                 
              being utilized include scanning tunnelling microscopy, surface                 
              infrared absorption spectroscopy, high-resolution low-energy                   
              electron diffraction, and low energy electron microscopy.  Theory              
              being applied includes molecular dynamics and energy minimization              
              with semi-empirical potentials, Monte Carlo simulation, dynamic                
              modeling of step motion and reaction rate theory.  Simple atomic               
              adsorbates such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are being                    
              studied on vicinal nickel (100) and silver (110) single crystal                
              surfaces.  The research is organized in three integrated general               
              areas: equilibrium  structure and energies of surfaces,                        
              adsorbate- and self-diffusion on surfaces, and dynamics of step                
              motion.
