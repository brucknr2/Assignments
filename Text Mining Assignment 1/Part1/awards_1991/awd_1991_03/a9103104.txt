Abstract    :
                   Professors Osher, Engquist, and others will continue their                
              individual and joint research on the development analysis and                  
              applications of numerical methods for nonlinear partial                        
              differential equations.                                                        
                                                                                             
                   Specific methods to be studied include: essentially                       
              nonoscillatory shock capturing techniques, front capturing                     
              algorithms, multiresolution and wavelet based methods, numerical               
              homogenization, effective boundary conditions, kinetic models,                 
              spectral and viscosity methods, particle methods, and stochastic               
              difference methods.                                                            
                                                                                             
                   Engineering and physical applications to be studied include:              
              aerodynamical properties of high speed vehicles, hydrodynamic                  
              device models, miscible flow in porous media, combustion,                      
              reacting gas flows, shock turbulence interactions, microwave                   
              scattering, Boltzmann equations, nuclear fusion reactors, and                  
              core-annular flows.                                                            
                                                                                             
                   This broad range of activity has value both in its own right              
              and with regard to extensive applications.
