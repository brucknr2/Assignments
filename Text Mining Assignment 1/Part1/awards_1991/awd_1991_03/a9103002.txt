Abstract    :
                   Scientists and engineers often encounter data in the form of              
              a relatively dense collection of points on or near the surface of              
              the object of interest; and one objective is to reconstruct the                
              surface of the object.  Examples come from medical imaging,                    
              machine vision, industrial engineering, statistical analysis for               
              high-dimensions, and geometric modelling.  This research will                  
              develop algorithms for such problems when neither the topology                 
              nor the geometry of the surface are known a priori; both must be               
              inferred in automated fashion from the data points.
