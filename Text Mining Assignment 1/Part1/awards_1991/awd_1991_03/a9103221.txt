Abstract    :
                 The principal investigator will study the geometry of                       
              submanifolds of symmetric space through polar actions on the                   
              symmetric space. A polar action is an invariant group action on the            
              symmetric space such that the submanifold meets the orbits of the              
              action orthogonally. The orbits of such an action play a role in               
              the submanifold geometry and in Morse theory on the manifold. This             
              tool is expected to find application in the infinite dimensional               
              case as well as the standard finite dimensional case.                          
                Symmetric spaces, such as the plane or the sphere, are among the             
              most important spaces in geometry and physics. The principal                   
              investigator will study subspaces of symmetric spaces, for example             
              a curve on the sphere. The major tool will be a study of the                   
              invariant motions of the symmetric space, such as the rotations of             
              the sphere, which have a particular geometric relationship with the            
              subspace. An understanding of this special set of motions will                 
              provide details about the geometry of the subspace itself.//
