Abstract    :
                   The research consists of three projects in the topology of                
              4-dimensional manifolds.  The first project is a continuation of               
              joint work with R. Lee (Yale University) in which the                          
              investigations are focused on: (a) the least genus problem for                 
              embedded surfaces, (b) obstruction theory for embeddings, and (c)              
              topological rigidity of simple embeddings.  The second project                 
              concerns finite group actions on 4-manifolds, with emphasis on                 
              the question of smoothability and methods of classification.  The              
              third project concerns nonorientable 4-manifolds and their exotic              
              smooth structures.                                                             
                   Manifolds are very natural geometric objects, being the                   
              locally Euclidean ones.  Answering questions about four-                       
              dimensional manifolds, in particular, may have cosmological                    
              significance, for we live in a manifold of three space dimensions              
              and one time-dimension.
