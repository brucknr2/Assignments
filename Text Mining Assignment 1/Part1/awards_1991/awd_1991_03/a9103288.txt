Abstract    :
                The primary objective of the proposed research is to study                   
              the structure and dynamics of chemisorption through He atom                    
              scattering on crystalline surfaces using the relatively new                    
              experimental technique, He atom-surface spectroscopy (HAS).                    
              Surfaces formed when a series of long-chained hydrocarbons,                    
              alkylthiols, are chemisorbed onto a gold (111) surface are to                  
              be examined.  The low energy He atoms, since they do not react                 
              with or charge the surface, are the probe of choice for these                  
              systems.                                                                       
                An understanding of the structure and dynamics of the                        
              surfaces to be studied has implications in many areas including                
              catalysis, models for biological interfaces and membranes,                     
              corrosion protection, and adhesion problems.  The project                      
              furthers VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for                   
              women to advance their careers in science or engineering                       
              through research, and to encourage other women to pursue                       
              careers in these areas through the investigators' enhanced                     
              visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In this                       
              project, the proposed activities which contribute to the second                
              objective include:  organizing a Garvin Medalist Symposium                     
              series of outstanding women chemists; serving as a guest                       
              lecturer in "Science, Technology, and Society" course; and                     
              interacting with the HAS research group, an interdisciplinary                  
              group, through daily research contact and formal seminar                       
              presentations.
