Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of              
              New Mexico will purchase hardware and software to equip a                      
              visualization and animation laboratory dedicated to the support                
              of research in the mathematical sciences.  The laboratory will be              
              used by several ongoing research projects including:                           
              1. Numerical Analysis of Dynamical Systems                                     
              2. Techniques in Automatic Grid and Code Generation                            
              3. Investigations of the Dynamics of Wall-Bounded Flows                        
              4. Analysis and Computation of the Flow of Mixtures.
