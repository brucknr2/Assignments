Abstract    :
                   This research uses geometric insights to examine classical and            
              fundamental statistical concepts and also to develop modern                    
              techniques for effective simulation.  The work depends upon                    
              understanding basic statistical ideas in differential geometric                
              and/or algebraic topologic terms.
