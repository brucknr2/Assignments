Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A continuation of the study of evolution of Indian Oceanmonsoon                
              and Arabian Sea upwelling. The record of the development of this               
              system will be extended from the present 1 m.y.B.P. to 3.5                     
              m.y.B.P. in order to determine the relative importance of solar                
              radiation, uplift and glaciation for the monsoonal system.                     
              Modelling results for the same interval will be compared to                    
              faunal and isotopic results to test the influence of global                    
              climate models and compare these records with those from Pacific               
              and Atlantic Oceans.
