Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research project supports a socio-linguistic                 
              anthropologist in Bethel, Alaska.  The research will study how                 
              Yupik Eskimo and non-native men in this small rural community                  
              establish their identities through conversation and discourse                  
              related to subsistence.  In Alaska, Native American subsistence                
              patterns of hunting and fishing are critical definers of an                    
              appropriate lifestyle.  Methods include participant observation                
              during subsistence hunting and fishing, recording and analysis of              
              conversations during daily life, and extended life history                     
              elicitation during formal interviews.                                          
                                                                                             
              This research is important because Native Americans are one of                 
              the fastest growing census categories in U.S. society. Increased               
              understanding of how Native Americans understand themselves in                 
              relation to non-Native others will help society decision makers                
              to design programs that deal with issues of importance to Native               
              Americans.
