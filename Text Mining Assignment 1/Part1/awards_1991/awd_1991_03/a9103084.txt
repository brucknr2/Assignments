Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Solid State Sciences Committee (SSSC) of the Board on Physics              
              and Astronomy, together with the National Materials Advisory                   
              Board (NMAB), will co-host the 1991 SSSC Forum on February 27,                 
              1991.  The Forum will be followed on February 28-March 1, 1991,                
              by a technical meeting organized by the Materials Research                     
              Society (MRS) and sponsored by several other materials societies.              
              The technical themes of the Forum and the MRS program will be                  
              superconductivity and the science of semiconductor processing.                 
              The policy theme of the Forum will be the results of the National              
              Coordinating Meeting on Materials, held November 29- 30, 1990.                 
              The National Coordinating Meeting on Materials culminated the                  
              regional meeting process that was initiated to follow up the                   
              National Research Council study "Materials Science and                         
              Engineering for the 1990s."  In addition, the Forum will                       
              give special attention to the role of consortia in materials                   
              science and engineering.
