Abstract    :
                   The focus of this research is on the formulation and                      
              development ofnovel, effective techniques for distributed,                     
              network-wide resource allocation and connection management in                  
              broadband integrated services digital networks (BISDN) within the              
              framework of fault-tolerant operation.  The focus of these                     
              techniques is to optimize the utilization of network switch and                
              transmission resources in meeting user demand and service  quality             
              requirements, especially under heavy usage and/or operation under              
              network faults.  In addition, the focus includes development of                
              alternative, novel fault tolerant switch architectures, network                
              topologies and transmission facilities. Relative to other research             
              on resource allocation and connection management for BISDN, the                
              approach here is unique in that fault tolerance is incorporated not            
              only within the resource allocation and connection  management                 
              algorithms, but also into the network switches, topography and                 
              transmission capabilities.
