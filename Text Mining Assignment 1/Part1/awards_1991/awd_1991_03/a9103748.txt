Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The basic goal of this research is ice formation in the                   
              atmosphere.  The basic approach includes experiments performed with            
              an instrumented cloud chamber and simulations using a numerical                
              model.  Experiments will focus on ice initiation by natural                    
              aerosols from -5 to -40 degrees C, and for a range of humidity                 
              conditions, both subsaturated and supersaturated with respect to               
              water.  Results from these and previous studies of artificial ice              
              nuclei will be incorporated into numerical simulations of natural              
              and seeded clouds, for comparison to atmospheric observations.
