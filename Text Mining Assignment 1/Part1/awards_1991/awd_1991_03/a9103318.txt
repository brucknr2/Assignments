Abstract    :
                In projects (1) and (2) the focus is on obtaining bounds on                  
              the number of integral solutions of certain classes of                         
              diophantine equations over function fields which depend only                   
              on the number of monomials of the equation.  This problem which                
              seemed so inaccessible a few years ago, has recently made                      
              significant progress and the success is largely due to the abc-                
              inequality.  The proposed research in project (3) is to                        
              investigate Siegels conjecture over complex number fields.                     
              Project (4) deals with Thue's equation F(x,y)=1 over the                       
              rational.  The object here is to show that the number of                       
              integral solutions can be bounded in terms of the number of                    
              large coefficients of F only.                                                  
                The project is in an area of number theory where the methods                 
              of proof are extremely complicated and technical.  It furthers                 
              VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for women to                   
              advance their careers in science or engineering through                        
              research, and to encourage other women to pursue careers in                    
              these areas through the investigators' enhanced visibility as                  
              role models on the host campuses.  In this project, the                        
              proposed activities which contribute to the second objective                   
              include:  teaching a graduate course, co-sponsoring the Number                 
              Theory seminar, and organizing a new seminar.  The aim of the                  
              last project is to offer women mathematicians greater                          
              stimulation in research and interaction with other                             
              mathematicians.
