Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two closely spaced profiles of heat flow measurements will be made             
              across the forearc of the Tonga-Kermadec arc with the objective to             
              constrain the shear stress on the thrust fault between Pacific and             
              Australian plates.  Variations of heat flow over short distances               
              will allow the PIs to constrain the extent to which pore water                 
              advection transports heat through the forearc.
