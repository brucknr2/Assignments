Abstract    :
                   This research attempts to gain a better understanding of the              
              intrinsic properties of complete sets for many natural complexity              
              classes.  The research will explore how the complexity-theoretic               
              properties of complete sets are affected by the strength of the                
              reducibilities defining them, and the relationships between these              
              properties and the central problems in complexity theory.  One such            
              property is immunity, which examines whether all complete problems             
              have larger subproblems which are easier to solve than the full                
              problem.  This research bears upon the existence of certain types of           
              approximations to these intractable sets.  Another area of study is            
              the strength of efficient reductions between pairs of complete sets            
              and the possibility of reductions from complete sets to sparse sets or         
              other sets with a particular structure.  The relationships between the         
              complexity-theoretic results in these areas and other current research         
              problems such as the isomorphism problem and the existence of certain          
              types of one-way functions are a central focus of this work.
