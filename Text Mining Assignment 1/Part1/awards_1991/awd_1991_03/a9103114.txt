Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project provides support for participation of               
              two University of Miami scientists, in an on-going research                    
              project in Karachi, Pakistan, at the Pakistan Council of                       
              Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR) under the direction of              
              Dr. M. A. Beg.  The project aims at finding optimum methods to                 
              remove pollutants from industrial waste water so that it can be                
              reused.  The research has been underway for three years, and at                
              the stage of moving from laboratory studies to pilot plant                     
              treatment.  The work deals with small tanneries as well as                     
              textile mill waste waters.  For small tanneries the treatment                  
              covers high pH, high solids, biological aeration, and for textile              
              mills it is based on ultrafiltration.  It is anticipated that the              
              existing pilot plant will be modified, and additional, more                    
              representative, types of tannery and textile wastes will be                    
              collected from various plants.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This project brings two U.S. specialists and well known                
              researchers in environmental sciences with an active senior                    
              Pakistani scientist to collaborate in finding viable solutions to              
              one of the most common and damaging problems in urban areas of                 
              developing countries.  The results can have wide application in                
              many countries where both the scarcity of water and the                        
              pervasiveness of contamination from low-tech industries cause                  
              severe degradation of the quality of life.  The project fits well              
              within the guidelines of the Science in Developing Countries                   
              Program.
