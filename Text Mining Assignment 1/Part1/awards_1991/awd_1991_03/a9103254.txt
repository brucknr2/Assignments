Abstract    :
                   The investigator will study differential equations with                   
              symmetry and applications to solid mechanics.  The applications                
              involve geometrically exact formulations of nonlinearly elastic                
              and viscoelastic solids and structures.  The goals of the work                 
              are to detect new phenomena and to further develop and exploit                 
              the connection between symmetry and nodal properties of solutions              
              of elliptic equations, particularly in the context of global                   
              bifurcation and continuation problems.                                         
                   The way that structures bend can be described                             
              mathematically as the solution of equations describing the                     
              structure.  Often the bending depends on a parameter, for                      
              instance the load on the structure,  If as the load varies the                 
              structure can bend in different ways for the same load, then the               
              solutions are said to bifurcate at that value of the load.                     
              Global descriptions of the bifurcations are generally hard to                  
              get, but are very valuable. When the structure is symmetric,                   
              those symmetries can be used to get a better grip on the global                
              behavior.  Applications arise not only in analysing structures                 
              but also in studying the behavior of materials themselves.
