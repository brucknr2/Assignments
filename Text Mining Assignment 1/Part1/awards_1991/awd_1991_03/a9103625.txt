Abstract    :
                   This project will study boundary value problems for wave                  
              equations, spectral properties of Schrodinger operators,                       
              pseudodifferential operators in connection with nonlinear partial              
              differential equations, and index theories.  The techniques to be              
              used incorporate noncommutative harmonic analysis, spectral                    
              theory, and K-homology.                                                        
                   The questions to be analysed have been motivated both by                  
              mathematical and physical problems.  Results from this project                 
              will in turn help our understanding of areas such as wave                      
              propagation and quantum mechanics.
