Abstract    :
              In this project the PI's will collect and interpret high-quality               
              and high-resolution conductivity, temperature, depth, oxygen and               
              nutrient data in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, along a line                     
              designated as P-17N by the World Ocean Circulation Experiment                  
              (WOCE), and running generally parallel to the coast from San                   
              Francisco to the Shumagin Islands, with an intersecting leg into               
              Sitka, Alaska.  Specific science issues to be addressed include                
              heat and fresh water divergences, exchange of properties between               
              the Alaska Gyre and the Subtropical Gyre, spreading and ventilation            
              rates of North Pacific Intermediate Water, and bottom boundary                 
              interactions as seen in silica distributions.
