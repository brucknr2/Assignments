Abstract    :
                   Professor Koch will continue his investigations of models                 
              relevant to the theory of critical phenomena, and of neural network            
              models related to disordered systems in statistical mechanics.                 
              This includes the development of new techniques in renormalization             
              group analysis, which connects his work to constructive quantum                
              field theory, where similar methods are being used.                            
                   Professor Koch's work is in the area broadly known as                     
              mathematical physics where a deep mathematical understanding of                
              physical models is sought.  One of his projects involves an                    
              investigation of the renormalization group, where an attempt is                
              made to understand interactions at all length scales                           
              simultaneously.  This is one of the most important and least                   
              understood problems in statistical mechanics and quantum field                 
              theory today.
