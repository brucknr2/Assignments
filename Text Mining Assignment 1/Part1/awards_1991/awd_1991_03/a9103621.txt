Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will study the                 
              phase transition between the Haldane phase and the dimerized                   
              phase in the spin-1 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic, one-dimensional              
              quantum spin system.  In particular, he will prove that this                   
              phase transition does indeed exist by showing that an order-                   
              parameter proposed for this transition is zero in one phase and                
              nonzero in the other.  In addition, the principal investigator                 
              will continue his rigorous study of the majority rule                          
              renormalization group transformation for Ising-type systems.                   
              Finally he will study the existence of continuous spectra for the              
              infinite volume limit of the Hamiltonian of a quantum spin                     
              system.                                                                        
                   The behavior of matter at the microscopic scale is very                   
              often what determines the behavior of matter at the macroscopic                
              or observable scales of ordinary life.  For example, what we call              
              the temperature of a liquid or gas is simply the macroscopic or                
              cumulative effect of the motion of countless atoms and molecules               
              on the microscopic scale of the material.  In this project the                 
              principal investigator will study various mathematical models of               
              the behavior of atoms at the microscopic or quantum level, in                  
              order to establish connections between microscopic and                         
              macroscopic properties of matter.
