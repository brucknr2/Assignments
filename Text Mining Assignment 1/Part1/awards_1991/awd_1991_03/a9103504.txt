Abstract    :
                   Researchers commonly have assumed that petrographically and               
              mineralogically pristine aragonitic fossils represent original                 
              chemical compositions which, therefore, can be used to obtain                  
              paleoenvironmental information.  However, a recent study indicates             
              that substantial chemical changes have occurred in pristine-                   
              appearing, Holocene-age fossils prior to any aragonite/calcite                 
              transformation.  Given the occurrence of these chemical changes,               
              information is needed regarding both the chemical diagenetic                   
              effects of specific environments and the chronologic progression               
              of such chemical changes.  To delineate the chemical effects of a              
              common diagenetic environment, to provide a detailed chronologic               
              framework for early diagenetic changes, and to characterize the                
              diagenetic integrity of various chemical species in aragonite,                 
              intraspecies comparisons will be make of the stable isotopic and               
              elemental compositions of dated, wholly aragonitic Holocene corals             
              that have been exposed only to the submarine diagenetic                        
              environment.  Coral samples already have been obtained from                    
              submarine cores, taken off the coasts of St. Croix and Puerto Rico,            
              providing a unique opportunity to study a progressive record of the            
              exposure of aragonite to submarine conditions over the past 10,000             
              years.  This detailed information regarding progressive chemical               
              changes in wholly aragonitic fossils will contribute not only to               
              the understanding of early chemical diagenesis, but will provide               
              critical information for improving the reliability of                          
              paleoenvironmental interpretations based on the chemical                       
              compositions of fossils.
