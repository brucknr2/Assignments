Abstract    :
                   Professor Milne will work on Shimura varieties.  He hopes to              
              extend the results on the conjugation of Shimura varieties to                  
              mixed Shimura varieties; to extend the proof of the conjecture of              
              Langlands and Rapapport from Shimura varieties of PEL-type to                  
              other Shimura varieties.  He also hopes to see whether the                     
              properties conjecturally defined by motives hold.                              
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
