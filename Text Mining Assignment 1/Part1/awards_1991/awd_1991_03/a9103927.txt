Abstract    :
                   Professor Barefoot will study 4 and 5 connected Halin graphs              
              as well as amalgams that generalize Halin graphs.  In particular,              
              he intends to study their Hamiltonian properties.                              
                   Graph Theory goes back perhaps two hundred years, but only                
              in the last half-century has the field become an active, fertile,              
              and flourishing branch of mathematics.  A graph is a network of                
              lines ("edges") joining points ("vertices"), thus the language of              
              graphs becomes a natural way of describing interrelationships                  
              among separated objects.  Graph Theory figures most prominently                
              as an essential tool in Communications Theory and Computer                     
              Science.
