Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study the fundamental                     
              properties of hypergeometric series, especially basic (q-) and                 
              multibasic hypergeometric series.  He will also work on the                    
              harmonic analysis of Racah, q-Racah and Askey-Wilson orthogonal                
              polynomials.  In particular, the principal investigator will study             
              summation, transformation and expansion formulas, product formulas             
              and integral representations for basic hypergeometric series.                  
              Previous work on convolution structures, multipliers, product                  
              formulas and generating functions for certain systems of orthogonal            
              polynomials will be extended to other classes of polynomials.  In              
              addition, he will employ his methods involving sums and integrals              
              of squares of real-valued functions to investigate the location of             
              zeros of entire functions.
