Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In October 1989, the principal investigators began a study of the              
              extent to which Devals bound discrete magmatic and tectonic units              
              of the East Pacific Rise.  They used a 'rock coring' sampling                  
              technique, as well as dredging and a new precussion core rock                  
              sampler to collect samples at 198 sites.  Bottom photographs and               
              videos were also obtained.  The result is an unprecedented data set            
              that includes very precisely located samples, both along and across            
              the East Pacific Rise, over nearly fifty kilometers of ridge.
