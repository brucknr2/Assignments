Abstract    :
              We have constructed a transformation-competent, Arabidopsis ecotype            
              Columbia strain GH50 nuclear genomic library in Agrobacterium host             
              strain AGL1 and cosmid vector pLZO3, both specially engineered for             
              these purposes.  This genomic library comprises some 22,000 random             
              clones gridded onto 225 96-well microtiter dishes and, if random,              
              carries some five Arabidopsis genomic equivalents.  Arabidopsis                
              strain GH50 carries a dominant acetolactate synthase (als) allele              
              conferring chlorsulfuron resistance.  We shall develop high                    
              efficiency Arabidopsis whole-plant DNA transformation of newly                 
              germinated seedlings as a tool for gene rescue.  By a "successive              
              approximation" method, we shall conduct seedling transformation so             
              as to be able to infer individual clones in the genomic library                
              giving rise to transformants.  We shall use the transformation-                
              competent Arabidopsis GH50 genomic library constructed in                      
              Agrobacterium to rescue the ahs1-1 allele conferring resistance to             
              the sulfonylurea herbicide chlorsulfuron.                                      
                                                                                             
              If successfully developed, this technology will allow the                      
              expeditions isolation of genes central to plant growth and                     
              development.  This gene rescue technology will allow us to                     
              efficiency integrate Arabidopsis physical genomic and genetic                  
              maps.***//
