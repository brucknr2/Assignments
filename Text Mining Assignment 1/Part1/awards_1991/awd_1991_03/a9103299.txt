Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division Professor Yarkony will investigate                      
              several problems in spin-forbidden and electronically                          
              nonadiabatic chemistry. These processes play a major role in                   
              determining the rate of a number of industrially important                     
              chemical reactions.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Professor Yarkony  will develop computer algorithms which will                 
              include: (1) the capability for determining relativistic                       
              wavefunctions using large scale configuration state function                   
              expansions based on quasidegenerate perturbation theory within                 
              the Breit-Pauli approximation, and (2) the use of analytical                   
              gradient methods for locating regions of significant electronic                
              nonadiabaticity, that is, allowed, avoided and actual crossings                
              of potential energy surfaces, and for determining derivative                   
              couplings in these regions.  He will consider nonadiabatic                     
              electronic quenching reactions such as that between Na+HCl                     
              which has been the object of recent experimental and                           
              theoretical studies. He will focus on the nature of the                        
              adiabatic-diabatic state transformations. Other areas to be                    
              investigated include: (1) photochemical dissociation processes,                
              (2) a characterization of the global potential energy surfaces                 
              and derivative couplings for the He-H2 system, and (3)  a study                
              of spin-forbidden dipole-allowed radiative decay processes in                  
              the molecules NO+ and O2+, which are candidates for energy                     
              storage intermediates in energy transfer in chemical lasers, as                
              well as the molecules SiCl2, SiH2, and SiHCl which play a role                 
              in semiconductor fabrication through vapor deposition.
