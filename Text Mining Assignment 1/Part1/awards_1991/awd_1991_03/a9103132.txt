Abstract    :
                   This project is a study of the dynamics and spectra of                    
              optically driven atoms in the case that they are exposed to a                  
              perturbed electromagnetic mode density.  It involves the design                
              and construction of cavities whose perturbation of the                         
              electromagnetic mode density is particularly strong.  Optical                  
              trapping techniques will be employed to eliminate transit-time                 
              limitations on the size of optical cavities or their active                    
              regions.  Owing to the fundamental changes in driven atom                      
              dynamics that can occur in the presence of a perturbed                         
              electromagnetic mode density, the present studies may lead to the              
              operation of optical devices in hitherto unaccessible regimes.  A              
              secondary objective of this work will be to investigate the                    
              response of free-space atoms to complex, for example bichromatic,              
              excitation fields.
