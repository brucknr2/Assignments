Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Jaffe will continue to explore the roles of free cytosolic                 
              calcium pulses, waves and gradients in the development of                      
              embryological pattern, in cytokinesis as well as in                            
              fertilization. His broad purpose is to discover and describe                   
              spatiotemporal calcium patterns which have been conserved in                   
              evolution and to explore their developmental roles and                         
              mechanisms. His main method for visualizing these patterns will                
              be to inject chemiluminescent, calcium specific proteins called                
              aequorins. He will also use vibrating calcium specific electrodes              
              to explore patterns of calcium currents through cell surfaces. He              
              will continue this exploration in fucoid, ascidian, Xenopus and                
              medaka eggs as well as in some other systems. One of the main                  
              methods for modifying, and thus for exploring the role of, these               
              calcium patterns will be to suppress them by injecting                         
              appropriate calcium buffers. Dr. Jaffe will also modify such                   
              patterns via appropriate applications of calcium channel blockers              
              and agonists as well as calcium ionophores. This enterprise                    
              should prove to be of broad value in understanding cell                        
              development because calcium ions are among a relatively small                  
              class of small substances (like hydrogen ions, ATP, cyclic AMP,                
              IP3, etc.) whose intracellular patterns are central to the                     
              physiological control mechanisms within cells.
