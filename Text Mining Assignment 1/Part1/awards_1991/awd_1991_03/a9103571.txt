Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will allow the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State                   
              University at University Park to acquire a mini-super class                    
              computer system.  The research studies to be performed include                 
              the following:  Protein Crystal Structures, Molecular Dynamics                 
              Simulations of Solvation, Quantum Chemistry by Random Walk,                    
              Computer Simulation of Macromolecular Structure and Function,                  
              Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Surface Reactions,                           
              Simulations of Molecular Liquids and Physisorbed Layers and                    
              Computer-Assisted Studies of Structure-Property and                            
              Structure-Activity Relationships Using the ADAPT computer                      
              software system.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The computational demands of modern chemical research require                  
              the proper computing system that would avoid wasteful                          
              bottlenecks by balancing a variety of computational                            
              capabilities with individual workstations, networks, hardware                  
              and software maintenance, support personnel and training in all                
              areas of computational chemistry.  Many new insights into the                  
              kinetics of chemical reactions can be developed through                        
              theoretical studies with use of mini-supercomputers when the                   
              experimental data are inaccessible.  In addition, the most                     
              cost-effective computers are the mini-supercomputers.
