Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this travel award is to allow Academician                       
              N. A. Shilo, member of the Presidium and Councillor to the                     
              President of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Science, to visit Dr.                     
              Patricia Anderson at the University of Washington-Seattle                      
              and Dr. Paul Colinvaux at the University of Ohio-Columbus                      
              to discuss the possibility of initiating a new research                        
              program on the paleoclimatic and paleovegetational history                     
              of the northern Urals and Novaya Zemlaya Island.  He would                     
              also be able to participate in a small workshop to be held                     
              in Seattle on "Paleoclimates of Beringia" with the group                       
              involved in cooperative research since 1989 that included                      
              pollen and geochemical analysis of lake sediments                              
              collected on two field expeditions.                                            
                                                                                             
              The Soviets expect to sponsor an American team in 1991 to                      
              core lakes in the northern Urals, an area with little                          
              knowledge of the past climate or vegetation.  That would                       
              complement the ongoing project in the Soviet North East.                       
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine                                  
              complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                      
              mutual interest and competence in the field of basic                           
              scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,                     
              and mutuality of benefit.
