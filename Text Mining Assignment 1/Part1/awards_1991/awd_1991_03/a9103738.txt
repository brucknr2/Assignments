Abstract    :
                   The investigators will study a collection of problems in                  
              combinatorial analysis of stochastic structures on trees.                      
              Specific topics include random fields and discrete spatial                     
              processes, Markov properties of random fields, critical random                 
              walk in random environment on trees, and random fields on trees                
              and conditioned branching processes.  These topics are in the                  
              field of probability theory.
