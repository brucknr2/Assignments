Abstract    :
                   In singularity theory, topological methods have come to play              
              an important role, both in the classification of singularities,                
              as well as in determining the properties of mappings.  In turn,                
              these topological properties can be used to answer fundamental                 
              questions about nonlinear problems.  Professor Damon has been                  
              developing topological analogues of the infinitesimal methods of               
              Mather for answering questions about the topological                           
              classification of singularities.  He has also discovered that the              
              methods used for these results are closely related to quite                    
              different questions concerning the topology of discriminants and               
              symmetry breaking problems in bifurcation theory.  He hopes to                 
              develop further results for topological equivalence questions, to              
              use recent developments to explore topology of discriminants and               
              symmetry breaking for compact Lie groups, and to investigate the               
              application of classification results for singularities of                     
              solutions of differential equations.                                           
                   Singularity theory has obvious relevance to other areas.                  
              Some of the most interesting solutions to systems of equations,                
              both ordinary and differential, are the singular ones.  In                     
              applications, it is often impossible to confine attention to the               
              regular solutions to problems, and knowledge about the nature of               
              singularities and about symmetry breaking is fraught with                      
              physical significance.
