Abstract    :
                   Advances in separation science are critical to future U.S.                
              economic competitiveness in the industries and the I/UCRC Program.             
              The objectives of the Center for Separations Using Thin Films at               
              the University of Colorado, Boulder are to:  (a) conduct basic                 
              research and related development activities for the use of thin                
              film technology in separation processes and b) provide rapid                   
              technology transfer between Center research projects and industrial            
              participants.  Thin films such as ceramics and polymers offer new              
              separation possibilities with a resulting impact on the capital,               
              operating costs, and energy consumption in industries that can use             
              the technology such as the chemical, petro chemical and gas                    
              separation industries.                                                         
                   The proposed center plans to work on acid/gas separation using            
              ion-exchange membranes and separation of olefin isomers using novel            
              transport membranes.  It will also focus on membrane fouling in                
              liquid phase cross-filtration, modeling, and laboratory studies for            
              control of solvent-cast membrane morphology in gas separation                  
              applications, etc.                                                             
                   This Center is being cost-shared with the Separations and                 
              Purification Program of the Division of Chemical and Thermal                   
              Systems (E.I. Frances, Program Director).                                      
                   The Program Director recommends that the University of                    
              Colorado, Boulder be awarded $60,000 per year for a five year                  
              continuing grant.                                                              
                   Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                  
              and/or the Director of the Engineering Center Division will review             
              the progress of the center on a number of criteria, including the              
              following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                    
              interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) The extent to                 
              which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                 
              robust research program is developing.  If the review is                       
              satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend support of the               
              next period of this continuing grant.
