Abstract    :
                   Electric power is an important factor in the Nation's                     
              competitiveness.  Research on the industrial use of electric power             
              and instrumentation will benefit a very large cross section of                 
              industries.  This planning grant will study the potential for                  
              forming an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                 
              Electric Power and Instrumentation at the University of New                    
              Orleans.                                                                       
                   This planning grant is studying the research, organization and            
              policies, as well as the potential for industry support for an                 
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Electric Power             
              and Instrumentation at the University of New Orleans.                          
                   The Principal Investigator is qualified and has the resources             
              to undertake this planning grant.                                              
                   The project has been coordinated with Dr. Kevin Clements,                 
              Program Director, Power Systems.                                               
                   The Program Manager recommends the University of New Orleans              
              be awarded $25,000 for one (1) year for this planning grant.
