Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to use archived data of the western north Atlantic              
              to constrain an inverse, general circulation model. The inverse                
              model will utilize time-averaged estimates of temperature,                     
              salinity, dissolved oxygen, potential vorticity, float tracks and              
              current meter data for an improved description of the mean                     
              circulation in the vicinity of the gulf stream. This technique                 
              should be applicable to other ocean basins, such as the South                  
              Atlantic in the future.
