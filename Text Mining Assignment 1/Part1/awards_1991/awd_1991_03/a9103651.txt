Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Political talk, whether in elections campaigns, legislative                    
              debates, public meetings, or elsewhere, is vital to the political              
              process. Yet very little is understood about the circumstances                 
              under which talk affects political outcomes.  This research will               
              develop game theoretic models which explore the role of debate and             
              explanation in political decision making.  Specifically, the                   
              project will examine talk in two circumstances: within legislatures            
              and committees as members debate policy choices, and during                    
              elections as legislators attempt to explain and defend their                   
              actions to constituents.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The principal analytic tool used will be the theory of games with              
              incomplete information -- specifically games involving costless                
              signals or communication. This is because political talk is                    
              frequently cheap. It is easy for individuals to make claims that               
              are not true and are know to be untrue.  This feature generates a              
              fundamental credibility problem that lies at the heart of cheap                
              talk models.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              When completed this project will help us better understand the                 
              impact of political communication on political outcomes.
