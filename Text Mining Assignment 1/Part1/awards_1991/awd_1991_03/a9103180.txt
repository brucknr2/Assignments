Abstract    :
              Aggregation procedures are of critical importance to a large                   
              number of the sciences, including engineering, computer science,               
              decision science, statistics, economics and other social                       
              sciences.  The purpose of this research is to develop a                        
              mathematical, information theory foundation for several central                
              classes of aggregation processes.  The idea in the development of              
              this foundation is that the theory may be able to characterize                 
              the kinds of faults and paradoxes, as well as the kinds of                     
              desired traits that can occur.  It is expected that the theory                 
              will be able to determine the best choice of procedures subject                
              to specified sets of criteria.  This theory will be applied to                 
              several specific classes of procedures coming from diverse                     
              disciplines.  Thus, it is expected that several new kinds of                   
              results will emerge for computer science and engineering,                      
              decision and choice theory, economics, statistics, ect.
