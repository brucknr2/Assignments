Abstract    :
                   This project will investigate new eigenvalue algorithms based             
              upon the idea of homotopy continuation.  These consist of deforming a          
              simple matrix into the matrix in question, while following the easily          
              found eigenpairs of the simple matrix to the eigenpairs being sought.          
              The issues to be studied include:                                              
                                                                                             
                     -  Further exploration of a recently developed                          
                        continuation algorithm for eigenvalue problems of                    
                        symmetric triadiagonal matrices.                                     
                                                                                             
                     -  Continuation algorithms for eigenvalue problems of large             
                        sparse matrices.                                                     
                                                                                             
                     -  Parallelization and vectorization of such algorithms                 
                        for a variety of advanced architectures.                             
                                                                                             
                     -  Continuation algorithms for eigenvalue problems of                   
                        nonsymmetric matrices.                                               
                                                                                             
                   The emphasis will be on the development of efficient                      
              computational algorithms and their numerical implementation.                   
              Hopefully, the work will lead to software packages that can be applied         
              to practical eigenvalue problems, especially those of large, sparse            
              matrices.
