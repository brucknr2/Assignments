Abstract    :
                   The project will develop and extend the Scalar Component                  
              Model approach to time series analysis. This method is                         
              particularly valuable in time series in which there is                         
              considerable variability.  Investigation will be carried out on                
              nonlinear time series.  The investigation may throw some light on              
              the connection between the threshold models and chaos.
