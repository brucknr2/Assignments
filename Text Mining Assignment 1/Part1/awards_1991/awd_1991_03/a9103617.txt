Abstract    :
              The questions of the value of scientific research and the proper               
              role of this research versus teaching are hotly contested.                     
              Stanford University, for example, is this year trying a new                    
              approach to shift the emphasis more toward teaching and,                       
              implicitly, away from research in evaluating faculty for critical              
              tenure decisions.  Working with Dr. John Heilbron of the History               
              of Science and Technology Program of the University of California              
              at Berkeley, Dr. Assmus is examining the history of the growth of              
              physics research, and more generally scientific research, from the             
              1920's to the 1950's from the perspective of a major state                     
              university.  Specifically, she is examining the growth of research             
              and its balance with teaching through a biographical study of                  
              Raymond T. Birge.  Birge, a physicist, was chair of the department             
              of physics at the University of California, Berkeley during                    
              critical years (1932-1955) before and immediately after World War              
              II.  A look at the historical development of the research                      
              university and its relation to national life should shed light on              
              decisions about the proper balance between research and teaching.              
              The Birge papers are kept at Berkeley.  John Heilbron, with his                
              extensive knowledge of the history of quantum physics and American             
              science, and his skill at writing scientific biographies, is an                
              ideal mentor for this project.
