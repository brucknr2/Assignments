Abstract    :
                   Spatial and temporal patterns of recruitment can strongly                 
              influence both the abundance and distribution of animals, as well              
              as the evolution of life history characteristics.  Larvae of most              
              benthic and demersal fishes arrive on reefs with well-developed                
              swimming and sensory capabilities and therefore, have the                      
              potential to strongly influence the pattern of recruitment by                  
              controlling where and when they settle.  This research will                    
              experimentally examine the role of larval behavior in                          
              determining the pattern of settlement of a benthic fish common to              
              oyster reefs.  The naked goby was chosen because its larvae                    
              undergo a demersal schooling phase prior to settlement.  Larvae                
              of this species are extremely abundant and can be easily                       
              observed.                                                                      
                   Dr. Palmer and collaborators will focus on two aspects of                 
              larval behavior (1) how larval behavior influences pre-settlement              
              distribution and dispersion patterns, in turn, influence spatial               
              patterns of settlement.  These two processes are extremely                     
              important to the ultimate patterns of recruitment because they                 
              can determine which other species influence larval survival and                
              movement, the spatial distribution of recruits, the need for                   
              post-settlement dispersal and the importance of density-dependent              
              interactions.
