Abstract    :
              By combining ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface analysis with                      
              electrochemistry, ex situ studies offer a new, vastly detailed                 
              route for examining electrochemical phenomena.  This approach                  
              is applied to the study of methanol and formic acid                            
              electrocatalysis on single crystal, metal electrodes.  These                   
              reactions are important in fuel-cell applications, but the                     
              lack of mechanistic understanding, particularly of spontaneous                 
              poisoning, inhibits further development.  This work applies                    
              concepts from gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis to build a                     
              paradigm for understanding electrocatalytic behavior.  The                     
              mechanistic details of the reactions, individually and in the                  
              presence of modifiers, are studied with a combination of UHV                   
              and electrochemical cross-characterization experiments and                     
              post-electrochemical analyses in UHV.  The growth modes and                    
              surface chemistry of metallic and nonmetallic modifiers are                    
              examined as well.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The research directly address the important issues that stand                  
              in the way of development of direct methanol fuel cells.                       
              However, of perhaps equal importance to the advancement of                     
              this important (because of energy resource limitations and                     
              environmental considerations) technology is the development                    
              and refinement of the ex situ methodology for the study of                     
              electrochemical systems, which could have a major impact on                    
              industrial process work.
