Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor J. Rush to work             
              in coding theory, the geometry of numbers and the relationship                 
              between the two.  He will work on dense lattice packings, thin                 
              lattice coverings and multiple packings and coverings.                         
                   This research falls in the interface between combinatorics                
              and number theory.  Number theory and combinatorics both started               
              from attempts to systematize the very first of all mathematical                
              activities, counting.  These fields have had an explosive                      
              development in the past few decades because of their importance in             
              communications and information technology, for example the design              
              of cellular networks.
