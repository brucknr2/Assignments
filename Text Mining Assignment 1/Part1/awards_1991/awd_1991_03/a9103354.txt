Abstract    :
              The surface structure, composition and molecular                               
              characteristics of electrode surfaces will be investigated                     
              using a range of powerful surface science methods.  In addition                
              to the widely used methods of Auger electron spectroscopy, low                 
              energy electron diffraction (LEED), Fourier transform infra-red                
              spectroscopy (FTIR) and electron energy loss spectroscopy                      
              (EELS), the new method of angular distribution Auger mapping                   
              (ADAM) will be employed.  This experiment obtains the intensity                
              information over a wide range of angles of emission using a                    
              unique apparatus.  ADAM has the promise to provide important                   
              spatial information about electrode surfaces. Systems to be                    
              studied include the effects of immersion of electrodes into                    
              ionic solution; the electrodeposition of metals, alloys and                    
              chemical compounds; anodization and electrodissolution;                        
              electrosorption of organic molecules; and chemical vapor                       
              treatment at atmospheric pressure.                                             
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on the use of surface science to investigate                
              electrochemical problems.  The work promises to lead to an                     
              enhanced understanding of the chemical and electrochemical                     
              reactivity of electrode surfaces.  This understanding is                       
              necessary to properly utilize electrochemistry in many                         
              practical applications such as catalysis and corrosion.
