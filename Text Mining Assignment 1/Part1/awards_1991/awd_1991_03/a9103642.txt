Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will document the chemical, mineralogic,            
              and physical processes of xenolith disaggregation, and will                    
              characterize the mechanisms by which heterogeneous contaminants are            
              assimilated in adjacent magma. To do so he will study granodiorite             
              xenoliths in the Watts Point and Monmouth Creek complexes of                   
              southwestern British Columbia. The results will provide geologists             
              with a better understanding of magma contamination mechanisms in               
              the upper part of the Earth's crust, and with new insights into                
              contamination processes at greater depths.
