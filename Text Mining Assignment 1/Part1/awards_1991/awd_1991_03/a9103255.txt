Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds for a microscope and image analysis               
              system that will allow analysis of a wide variety of images from               
              many different biological system.  The microscope is an old but                
              very powerful instrument for the study of living organisms.  Few               
              other biological tools allow subcellular structures, whole cells,              
              or even small organisms to be studied in an aqueous environment,               
              frequently in a living state.  New probes for cells structure and              
              function such as fluorescently labelled antibodies, DNA probes,                
              and calcium and pH dependent fluorophores provide even more                    
              powerful implements for exploring cells.  The computer in                      
              combination with the microscope has proven to be a particularly                
              powerful means for acquiring and analyzing data from images.  The              
              research projects described in this proposal encompass a variety               
              of biological systems including plant-virus interactions,                      
              cyanobacterial development, nerve regeneration, optical pathways,              
              leech development, and wasp evolution.  These projects share a                 
              need for a system to acquire, enhance, and analyze images.
