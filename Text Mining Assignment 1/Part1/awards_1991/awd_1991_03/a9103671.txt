Abstract    :
                   The proposed project represents a synthesis of classical                  
              ecological stream research and the use of new applications of                  
              remote sensing to detect an important ecological response                      
              variable, attached algae.  A series of laboratory experiments                  
              will be conducted where artificial stream pools with natural                   
              bottom substrates will be manipulated to determine the effects of              
              water depth, surface reflectance, turbidity, and phytoplankton                 
              density on attached algal spectral reflectance.  Also, an in situ              
              stream experiment will be conducted to determine the effects of                
              benthic complexity and nutrient availability on the cascading                  
              trophic patterns, which controlled benthic algal biomass in the                
              laboratory experiments. Spectral reflectance from all experiments              
              will be measured using a narrow-band spectroradiometer and                     
              ground-truth samples will be taken for periphyton chlorophyll                  
              content and pertinent water quality variables.  Two similar in                 
              situ stream experiments conducted by other researchers in                      
              different geographic locations will be sampled in the same way.                
              In collaboration with remote sensing experts from the University               
              of Kansas, University of Nebraska, and Creighton University (NB),              
              spectral reflectance data from this project will be used to                    
              develop and refine a spectral reflectance model for periphyton in              
              streams.
