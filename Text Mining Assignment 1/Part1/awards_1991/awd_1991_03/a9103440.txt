Abstract    :
                   This grant is to continue a coordinated program of                        
              theoretical modeling and analysis of existing satellite data                   
              directed toward an improved understanding of the interaction of                
              the solar wind with the terrestrial magnetosphere-ionosphere                   
              system.  Key elements of the work include:  (A) quantitative                   
              time-dependent modeling of the open magnetospheric field                       
              configuration and the resultant mapping of the solar-wind                      
              electric field to the polar caps; (B) empirical study of polar-                
              cap convection patterns and of the polar-cap potential drop under              
              time-variable solar-wind/IMF conditions; and (C) empirical study               
              of thermal and suprathermal electron populations above auroral                 
              acceleration regions and their mapping to the magnetotail plasma               
              sheet.  The modeling efforts combine the flexibility and physical              
              clarity of analytical formulations with the computational power                
              of modern supercomputers.  The data analysis efforts combine                   
              multiple spacecraft datasets to address specific questions posed               
              by theory.  The close coordination of modeling and data-analysis               
              activities has a synergistic effect on understanding the complex               
              solar-terrestrial system.
