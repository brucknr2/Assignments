Abstract    :
                   This project will study the solvability of nonlinear                      
              elliptic boundary value problems.  Main emphasis will be placed                
              in the cases where either the problem is semilinear but the                    
              spectrum of the linear part is not known, or the nonlinear part                
              interferes with the spectrum.  Recent developments on                          
              abstractions of the mountain pass lemma are expected to render                 
              information on the issue of existence and multiplicity of                      
              solutions for these problems.                                                  
                   The problems to be studied are basic questions arising in                 
              equations that model problems in areas such as mathematical                    
              physics, biomathematics, and chemistry.
