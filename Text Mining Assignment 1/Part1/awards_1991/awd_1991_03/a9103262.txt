Abstract    :
              Three principal investigators will continue their present                      
              achievements of multidimensional images of chemically                          
              interesting system by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)                    
              imaging.  The work will focus on obtaining a decrease in the                   
              data acquisition time, on developing improved algorithms for                   
              image reconstruction, on preventing magnetic field gradient                    
              interference with magnetic field control, and on pulsed EPR                    
              imaging.  These studies promise to enhance the possibilities                   
              for the application of EPR imaging to a number of important                    
              systems in chemistry, materials, and medicine.                                 
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on an extension of the investigators                        
              previous work on electron paramagnetic resonance imaging.  The                 
              usual electron paramagnetic resonance experiment reports a                     
              spectrum averaged over the sample and the magnetic field.  The                 
              spectrum provides information about the unpaired electron spin                 
              density in the sample.  In imaging experiments this spin                       
              density is mapped over the sample to give a three dimensional                  
              image showing the location and intensity of the paramagnetic                   
              molecules.   The approach has potential in materials science,                  
              biometical studies and in the chemistry of non-uniform                         
              materials.
