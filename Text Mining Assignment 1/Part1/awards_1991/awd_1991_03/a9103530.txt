Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the chemical compositions of             
              fluid inclusions using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence techniques.              
              Precise fluid inclusion analyses will eventually enable well-                  
              constrained pressure-volume-temperature and thermodynamic modeling             
              of rock-fluid systems. Ultimately this will provide geologists with            
              important tools needed to unravel the geologic history of rocks.
