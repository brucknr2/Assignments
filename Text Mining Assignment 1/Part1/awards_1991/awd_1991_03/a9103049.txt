Abstract    :
              This project involves detailed field, geochemical and                          
              petrographic study of old supracrustal rocks associated with the               
              Ancient Gneiss Complex in Southern Africa, in order to identify                
              protoliths, to characterize the mantle sources of mafic igneous                
              rocks, and to determine the composition of sediment sources.                   
              Investigation will involve lithologic analyses of mapped                       
              supracrustal successions in Swaziland; petrographic studies;                   
              major and trace element analyses of terrigenous metasediments and              
              metavolcanics; and Nd isotopic studies of metasediments.  Results              
              should be important in constraining the tectonic setting of                    
              these rocks, as well as enhancing our understanding of the origin              
              and evolution of the early continental crust in southern Africa.
