Abstract    :
              Oxidation of metal hydride compounds will be used as a method                  
              for the systematic synthesis of coordinated dihydrogen.  Both                  
              one- and two-electron oxidations are anticipated, both in non-                 
              coordinating solvents and in the presence of potential ligands.                
              For transient products, chemical oxidation will be complemented                
              with rapid scan electrochemical studies using microelectrodes.                 
              As an alternative source of dihydrogen formation or facile                     
              creation of unsaturation in a polyhydride compound, the intro-                 
              duction into the coordination sphere of a strong pi-donor                      
              ligand (alkoxide) will be explored.  Preliminary results with                  
              an iridium compound support the utility of this concept.                       
              Finally, a method for combining hydride and alkoxide ligands in                
              the coordination sphere of an early/late transition metal                      
              heterobimetallic compound will be investigated.

              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                    
              metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Kenneth G.                     
              Caulton of Indiana University will explore ways to create                      
              coordinated dihydrogen and determine its chemical reactivity.                  
              These studies should have important implications for how                       
              various catalysts function in hydrogenation reactions, one of                  
              the most important industrial processes currently in use.
