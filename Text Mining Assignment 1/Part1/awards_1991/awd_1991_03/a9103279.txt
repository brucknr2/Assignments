Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this proposal Dr. McCarty explores the regulatory mechanism                 
              which controls and integrates expression of diverse developmental              
              responses related to seed maturation in maize. Mutations in the                
              Viviparous-1 (Vp-1) gene block much or all of maturation related               
              gene expression in embryo and aleurone tissues of the developing               
              seed. Two seemingly unrelated groups of genes are regulated by                 
              Vp1: 1) An embryo maturation set including various late                        
              embryogenesis abundant genes (LEA's) and the 7s globulin genes.                
              These genes are also regulated by the hormone, abscisic acid. 2)               
              The second set includes the genes of the anthocyanin pathway. Dr.              
              McCarty has shown that Vp1 activates the anthocyanin pathway by                
              activating a second regulatory gene, C1. Thus, these genes                     
              function as a regulatory hierarchy. His results suggest that Vp1               
              is a novel transcription factor. By expressing the Vp1 gene in                 
              maize protoplasts, he is able to characterize regulatory                       
              sequences involved in regulation of C1 and Em, a LEA gene of                   
              wheat. This system also provides a functional assay for the Vp-1               
              protein. His objectives are to 1) Determine how Vp-1 regulates                 
              transcription of target genes, 2) Use mutagenesis to define                    
              functionally important sequences in the Vp1 protein, 3) Identify               
              factors that interact with Vp1, 4) Characterize Vp1's role in                  
              development using ectopic expression and 5) Characterize                       
              transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of Vp-1                    
              expression.
