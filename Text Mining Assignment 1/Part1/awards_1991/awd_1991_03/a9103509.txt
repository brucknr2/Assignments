Abstract    :
                   This award will provide half of the funds needed for the                  
              acquisition of an electron microprobe. This new electron microscope            
              will primarily serve the needs of the Geology faculty and graduate             
              students in the Department of Geological Sciences at The University            
              of Indiana. The University of Indiana is committed to provide the              
              additional funds to make this acquisition possible.                            
                   Seven Geology Department faculty and their students have been             
              identified as primary users. Six other faculty expect to be less               
              frequent or occasional users. This large group of faculty and their            
              students pursue research in diverse areas (e.g. thermodynamic links            
              between mechanical and chemical processes in metamorphism, origin              
              of various types of volcanic and igneous rocks,provenance of                   
              terrestrial and lunar sediments, crystal chemistry and banding of              
              agate). This new microprobe will replace a 19-year old                         
              instrument,and will now make it possible to do elemental micro-                
              analyses  with greater accuracy and precision. In addition to the              
              use of this instrument to analyze minerals and rocks, wide use by              
              materials science researchers on the campus and in the community               
              is expected.
