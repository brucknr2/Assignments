Abstract    :
                The investigator will continue her study of multi-particle                   
              Hamiltonian, with emphasis on those for atomic and molecular                   
              systems.  She will consider problems related to the                            
              monotonicity of energy differences and the variation in the                    
              number of bound states with parameters such as the nuclear                     
              charge.  In addition, she will try to use ideas from wavelet                   
              theory to construct a set of orthogonal functions whose kinetic                
              energy is bounded above by a semi-classical functional of the                  
              one-particle density.                                                          
                The work in this project is of considerable practical                        
              importance since it provides the mathematical foundation for                   
              theoretical atomic and molecular physics, and some is relevant                 
              to practical computations on atomic and molecular systems.  The                
              project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                             
              opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                 
              engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                  
              pursue careers in these areas through the investigators'                       
              enhanced visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In                   
              this project, the proposed activities which contribute to the                  
              second objective include:  teaching an upper division course,                  
              participating in the mathematical physics seminar, and engaging                
              in other activities intended to encourage women students at                    
              Michigan to pursue careers in the mathematical sciences.
