Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Texas A&M University will hire a              
              research scientist to manage the department's computer facility.               
              This position will be dedicated to support research in the                     
              mathematical sciences, and the individual will assist in several               
              research projects, including, in particular: a project on                      
              stabilization and control problems in structural dynamics, a                   
              project on inverse problems in partial differential equations,                 
              and a project on research in computational algebraic and                       
              differential geometry.
