Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with research related to Flag and               
              Schubert schemes.  The principal investigator will work on the                 
              following problems: (1) develop a standard monomial theory for                 
              Kac-Moody groups; (2) determine the multiplicity of a singular                 
              point on a Schubert variety; (3) develop a standard monomial                   
              theory for tangent cones at singular points on a Schubert                      
              variety; (4) determine the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials P(w,t) for              
              w greater than or equal to t; (5) write the equations of the                   
              conormal bundle of a Schubert variety; (6) develop a theory of                 
              quantum Flag and Schubert schemes in the finite and affine cases.              
                   This project is concerned with the study of algebraic                     
              groups.  It combines three of the oldest areas of "pure"                       
              mathematics, algebra, analysis and geometry, yet it is of great                
              interest to physicists working on conformal field theory.
