Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The main objective of this project is to develop,                         
              theoretically as well as computationally, efficient numerical                  
              methods for solving problems in which convection dominates                     
              diffusion.  The solutions of such equations typically exhibit                  
              shocks, whose accurate and efficient computation is difficult.                 
              Special attention will be paid to nonlinear hyperbolic systems,                
              to models of semiconductor devices, and to compressible                        
              Navier-Stokes equations for viscous flows.  Study of numerical                 
              methods will center on the so-called Runge-Kutta Discontinuous                 
              Galerkin method, a parallelizable method that adopts from several              
              finite-difference methods their techniques for evaluating cell                 
              fluxes.  This work will extend to higher dimensions earlier                    
              results on one-dimensional problems.                                           
                   Applications of this research arise in studying and                       
              designing semiconductor devices when using the drift-diffusion                 
              and hydrodynamic models to describe the devices, and in solving                
              flow problems that come from aerodynamics.
