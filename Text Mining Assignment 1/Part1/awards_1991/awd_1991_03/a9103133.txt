Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his research on                  
              dynamical systems. In particular he will study the dynamics of                 
              entire functions, maps associated with Newton's method, and some               
              antiholomorphic maps. The dynamics of these maps will be applied to            
              the problem of trying to understand the automorphisms of the shift             
              map. These techniques will also be applied to other families of                
              interest in real dynamics including the Henon map, the standard                
              family, and a family of maps which arise in scattering theory.                 
                   Dynamical systems are playing an increasing role in various               
              subfields of mathematics and in mathematical modeling. One of the              
              applications to be studied in this project is an application to                
              scattering theory. Scattering theory is the branch of mathematics              
              which attempts to reconstruct an operator from a description of the            
              action of the operator on functions. It is a basic tool in physics.            
              The amalgamation of different methods is playing an important role             
              in the solution of many mathematical and scientific problems; this             
              project is one example of cross-disciplinary research at work.
