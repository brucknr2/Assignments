Abstract    :
                   This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to further                   
              develop Theseus, an unmanned aircraft for very high-altitude                   
              scientific missions.  During Phase II, the PI proposes the                     
              following activities:  (1) assemble a scientific advisory group;               
              (2) complete the design and construct an engineering mock-up of a              
              multispecies sampling payload; (3) validate the proposed                       
              powerplant through subscale tests; (4) verify weight projections               
              for cryogenic fuel tanks; (5) develop methods to reduce                        
              structural fabrication costs by 25%; and (6) complete a                        
              preliminary design.
