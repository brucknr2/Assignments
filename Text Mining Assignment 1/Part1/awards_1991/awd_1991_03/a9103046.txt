Abstract    :
                   This project will study parabolic partial differential                    
              equations in domains with rough boundaries.  Using as a frame of               
              reference recent results on the heat equation, efforts will be                 
              made to establish regularity properties of solutions to higher                 
              order parabolic equations and noncylindrical domains.  Main                    
              issues to be dealt with are the spectral properties of the                     
              domains and properties of the trace semigroup.                                 
                   In addition to solving basic questions in differential                    
              equations, the result of this project have implications to                     
              applied areas such as probability, physics and engineering.  In                
              particular problems in colloids and furtive materials might                    
              benefit from this investment.
