Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Weisman will study the kinetics and                 
              spectroscopy of azoalkanes and small aromatic molecules                        
              subjected to nanosecond pulses of uv radiation.  Light-induced                 
              dissociation and isomerization studies of azoalkanes will be                   
              continued and extended, and quantum mechanical calculations                    
              will be conducted to yield a detailed mechanistic understanding                
              of the photochemistry.  Some transient absorption and transient                
              CARS experiments will be performed.                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              The mechanisms by which energetically excited polyatomic                       
              molecules are relaxed down to their unexcited ground energy                    
              state will be explored and clarified in this project.  Some of                 
              the relaxation schemes are complex and challenging to unravel.                 
              Nonetheless, knowledge of the different steps involved in                      
              energy relaxation is important to be able to predict the                       
              relative amounts of dissociations and isomerizations that can                  
              occur in related molecular systems.
