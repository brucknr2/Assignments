Abstract    :
                   Diagenesis will be examined for two large scale sequences in              
              eastern Tennessee:  1) one deposited in a ramp setting during a                
              time of aragonite/high-magnesian-calcite facilitation in the Middle            
              to Late Cambrian, and 2) one deposited on a rimmed platform during             
              a time of low-magnesian calcite facilitation in Middle Ordovician.             
              An understanding of the relationship between diagenetic history and            
              sequence-stratigraphic framework will be developed by:  1) further             
              comparison of similar lithologies occurring in both sequences (eg.             
              oolite), 2) diagenetic studies of lithologies unique to one or the             
              other sequence (eg. subtidal "flat-pebble" conglomerates of the                
              Cambrian), and 3) analyses of diagenetic history through measured              
              sections of both sequences.  Thin-section petrography (polarized               
              light and cathodoluminescent), coupled with analyses, as well as               
              isotopic analysis of microsamples (0.3-0.6 mg) of diagenetic phases            
              and other rock components will be used in all parts of the                     
              research.  The geochemical data will be used to model mass transfer            
              of chemical components to aid in understanding fluid flow during               
              diagenesis.  The long-term objective is to establish a diagenetic              
              framework (stratigraphy + diagenetic processes + time) comparable              
              in detail to the paleoenvironmental and sequence-stratigraphic                 
              framework previously developed, and to determine how the diagenetic            
              history of large scale sequences differ depending on setting and               
              geologic age.
