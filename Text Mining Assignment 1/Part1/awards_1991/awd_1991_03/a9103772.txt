Abstract    :
                   Professor Tate will work on refined conjectures of Birch and              
              Swinnerton-Dyer type.  In particular, he will study a geometric                
              analogue of this conjecture and its possible connections with two              
              dimensional class field theory.  He will also study regular graded             
              associative algebras in dimensions greater than three.                         
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
