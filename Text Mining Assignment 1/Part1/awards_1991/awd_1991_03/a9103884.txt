Abstract    :
                   This project will support a series of meetings and produce a              
              report on the significant contributions, open problems, and                    
              likely future directions of mathematical sciences research and                 
              methods applied to problems in molecular biology, especially                   
              recent intensive work in the areas of genome and protein                       
              structure research.  The objective of the report is to make this               
              work known and accessible to a broad class of mathematical                     
              scientists (particularly graduate students and new Ph.D.'s) for                
              the purpose of increasing the participation of mathematical                    
              scientists in this area of research.  Secondary objectives are to              
              create a useful reference to this work for biologists and to make              
              the fruits of this collaboration more broadly known and                        
              appreciated in the scientific community.                                       
                   The project will produce a report on the significant                      
              contributions, open problems, and likely future directions of                  
              mathematical sciences research and methods applied to problems in              
              molecular biology, especially recent intensive work in the areas               
              of genome and protein structure research.  The objective of the                
              report is to make this work known and accessible to a broad class              
              of mathematical scientists (particularly graduate students and                 
              new Ph.D.'s) for the purpose of increasing the participation of                
              mathematical scientists in this area of research.
