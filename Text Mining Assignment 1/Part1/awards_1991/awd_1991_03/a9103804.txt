Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with research in the area of numerical               
              methods for large-scale continuous optimization.  The work will focus          
              on iterative algorithms for linear/nonlinear/network programming and           
              complementarity problems.  It will cover both the theory (convergence,         
              complexity, etc.) and the practice (implementation, numerical testing,         
              etc.).  Methods to be investigated include (i) coordinate descent              
              algorithms, (ii) approximate gradient algorithms, (iii) residual               
              reduction algorithms, (iv) multiplicative multiplier methods, and (v)          
              operator splitting algorithms.  Particular attention will be paid to           
              the efficient implementation of these algorithms on sequential and             
              parallel machines.  The computer codes produced by the study will be           
              made freely available to the research community for dissemination.
