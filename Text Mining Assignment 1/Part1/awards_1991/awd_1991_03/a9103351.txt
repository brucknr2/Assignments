Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his work in the                  
              general area of interacting particle systems.  In particular he                
              will conduct research in the following specific problem areas:                 
              self-organizing criticality, singular diffusions, catalytic                    
              surfaces, cellular automata.                                                   
                   The principal investigator will continue his work in the                  
              general area of interacting particle systems.  This subfield of                
              probability is motivated by several areas of science, including                
              physics and biology.  The investigator will be working on                      
              problems that impact physics.  In addition, he will develop new                
              techniques in the area of cellular automata which will result in               
              use of both deductive reasoning and computer experimentation in                
              search of new findings.
