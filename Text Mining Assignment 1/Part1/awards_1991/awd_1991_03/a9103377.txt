Abstract    :
              This research project seeks to develop analytical and design                   
              techniques for the control of noise. Two experimental techniques,              
              acoustical holography and structural intensity, will be combined with          
              commercially available modal analysis, frequency response simulation           
              (FRS) and structural dynamic modification (SDM) software. The main             
              goal is to develop means to confidently predict the required structural        
              modifications to a noise source that will cause desired reductions in          
              acoustic field responses. Structural modifications to be considered are        
              the addition of damping materials and stiffeners to a vibrating system.        
              This research is expected to lead to improved diagnostic techniques and        
              design knowledge in noise control engineering***//
