Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop innovative, experimental                
              teaching laboratories through the collaborative efforts of                     
              recent alumni currently enrolled in doctoral programs and the                  
              principal investigator.  Alumni, acting as consultants to an                   
              institution and curriculum that they understand, are                           
              contributing their expertise in cutting edge research to the                   
              development of laboratory exercises in developmental                           
              physiology, mobility, hormonal signalling, ion pumping,                        
              immunology, cancer physiology, and neurobiology.  The equipment                
              acquired includes: laminar flow hoods, an environmental shaker,                
              an incubator, and inverted microscopes for maintaining and                     
              examining tissue cultures, a time-lapse video recorder to                      
              monitor cellular migration, and microplate washer and reader                   
              for ELISA assays done in immunology and cancer biology                         
              laboratory exercises.
