Abstract    :
              General chemistry students in a second semester Quantitative                   
              Analysis laboratory will learn to carry out chemical analyses by               
              working cooperatively in small groups.  The groups will design                 
              experiments that are productive and efficient, carry them out, and             
              report on them.  The students will be assigned cooperative roles               
              and taught technical and personal skills needed to be effective in             
              group activities.  Experimental design including methods of                    
              identifying important experimental factors, optimizing the factors,            
              and collecting appropriate data to characterize the response of a              
              system will be a primary concern.  The teamwork and experimental               
              design activities will provide students a better understanding of              
              what scientists do and a more complete preparation for scientific              
              careers.  Information will be gathered to discover changes in                  
              student attitudes toward cooperative activities and science.
