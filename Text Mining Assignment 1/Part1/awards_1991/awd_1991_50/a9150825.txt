Abstract    :
               Development of Undergraduate Engineering Courses in Computing                 
              and Visualization at the University of UtahA new and innovative                
              method of undergraduate teaching in engineering is being                       
              developed by the Department of Computer Science, with the                      
              cooperation and participation of the undergraduate teaching                    
              faculty of engineering.  Specifically, the departments of                      
              Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science,                     
              Electrical Engineering and Material Sciences are participating                 
              in this course development proposal.  Furthermore, these                       
              engineering departments are planning to coordinate teaching                    
              methods and computer equipment with the Departments of Physics                 
              and Mathematics in the College of Science, who are making                      
              similar upgrades of their undergraduate teaching.  A basic                     
              course in Computer Science is taken by all of the students at                  
              the outset.Next, each of the engineering departments are making                
              coordinated curriculum developments which best suits their                     
              purpose.
