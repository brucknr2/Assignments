Abstract    :
              This project will use computers to construct a new type of                     
              analytical chemistry course at the freshman-sophomore level.                   
              It will focus on trace analysis of metal ions and organic                      
              substances in a toxic waste site that can be "sampled" by                      
              students to obtain uninterpreted analytical data via computer                  
              at many different locations at the site.  Students will carry                  
              out hands-on trace analyses with non-toxic substances in order                 
              to develop their laboratory skills, and to see how the                         
              analytical data from the "site" was obtained.  Applications of                 
              high-end graphics workstations throughout the lower-division                   
              laboratory courses, including the analytical course, will also                 
              be central to this project.  The uses will involve among other                 
              things designing sequesterants for pollution abatement,                        
              exploring host-guest interactions, and examining orbital                       
              interactions.
