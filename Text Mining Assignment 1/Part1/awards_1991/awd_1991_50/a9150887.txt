Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the further refinement of                        
              interactive computer software that simulates a variety of types                
              of experiments in population biology.  By its nature, population               
              biology deals with quantitative aspects of ecology, evolution and              
              behavior.  Examples include the effects of predator/prey or                    
              host/parasite relationships on the success (or extinction) of                  
              particular species, rates of fixation of mutations within                      
              populations of defined size, and others.  Mathematical models in               
              these branches of biology translate known or assumed properties                
              of individual members of populations into predictions about the                
              properties of the population as a whole.  The mathematical                     
              manipulations required are often tedious, difficult, or both.                  
              Thus math anxieties seriously impede the study of more than the                
              simplest basic principles of population biology at the                         
              undergraduate level.  The exemplary software being developed by                
              Alstad and his colleagues will make both simple and complex                    
              population models far more accessible to students at all levels.
