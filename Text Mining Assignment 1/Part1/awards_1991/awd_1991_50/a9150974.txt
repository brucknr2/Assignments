Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is purchasing a FT-IR and a UV/vis                    
              spectrophotometer and rebuilding a 300 MHz FT-NMR to create a                  
              laboratory instrument center for students in biological,                       
              organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry courses. A unique                   
              feature of the program is an upperclassman-freshman mentor                     
              system to offer students intensive hands-on experience with                    
              modern instrumentation as early in the curriculum as possible.                 
              Another feature of the project is the development of                           
              interdisciplinary experiments in the areas of bio-organic and                  
              physical-inorganic chemistry.
