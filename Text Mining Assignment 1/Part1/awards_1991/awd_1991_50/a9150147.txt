Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in                    
              collaboration with the Association of Science-Technology Centers               
              and several science centers, has requested $837,958 in NSF                     
              support of a project to make science museums more accessible to                
              minority groups.  In the project, AAAS and ASTC propose to                     
              provide technical assistance and staff training to science                     
              museums on equity issues, with emphases on institutional self-                 
              assessment, developing effective science education programs                    
              reaching minority audiences, and working effectively with                      
              community organizations and other institutions serving minority                
              groups.  Several museum sites will be involved initially in the                
              development of the four program components:                                    
                                                                                             
                   1.  development of guidelines for an equity self-assessment               
              in museums;                                                                    
                                                                                             
                   2.  science equity training for all museum staff;                         
                                                                                             
                   3.  the development of relationships between museums and                  
              community groups and schools and colleges and                                  
              universities that serve minorities; and                                        
                                                                                             
                   4.  a national effort to create awareness among minority                  
              groups of employment opportunities in science museums.                         
                                                                                             
              Additional dissemination will be provided through training                     
              workshops and sessions at museum conferences.  A "how-to" guide                
              and video will be developed for museums on conducting an equity                
              self-assessment.                                  //
