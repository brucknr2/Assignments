Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a comprehensive plan to deliver elementary science                     
              instruction throughout rural Minnesota schools.  It is                         
              modeled on the MN Public School System plan which provides                     
              teachers with a hands-on, inquiry-based science curriculum                     
              package and a centralized materials distribution network.                      
              Over a period of three years, two teams of Master Teachers                     
              will provide workshops at each of the Minnesota Educational                    
              Cooperative Service Units for approximated 900 elementary                      
              and middle school teachers.  Most of the participants in                       
              the program will then work as District Trainers with their                     
              administrators to provide inservice in science education                       
              within their schools and/or districts.  A number of the                        
              participants will be Regional Trainers who will function as                    
              science resource persons in their respective regions, and                      
              who will work with the District Trainers in providing local                    
              inservices.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This proposal is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                       
              Program because of its systemic plan to enhance the science                    
              teaching of rural teachers in the state of Minnesota.                          
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 2% of the amount                         
              requested from NSF.
