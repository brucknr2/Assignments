Abstract    :
               A computer classroom/laboratory is being established and                      
              classroom materials in discrete mathematics and algebra is                     
              being developed.  Based upon these materials, courses  in                      
              discrete mathematics and algebra are being taught which                        
              emphasize student activity (experimentation, interaction and                   
              discovery) rather than student passivity (listening to                         
              lectures). These courses will serve as models for other upper                  
              division mathematics courses.
