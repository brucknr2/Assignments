Abstract    :
              The Task Force on the general chemistry curriculum appointed by                
              the Division of Chemical Education of the American Chemical                    
              Society is considering three approaches to the reform of                       
              general chemistry instruction:  1.  Laboratory-based revisions                 
              in which new topics in chemistry would first be introduced in                  
              the laboratory.  2.  A subject area approach that selects the                  
              content and method of general chemistry on the basis of the                    
              chemistry one needs to know to grasp socially significant                      
              substances and processes.  3.  A modular approach that teaches                 
              an irreducible core and supplements that with coherent material                
              that is customized for the student audience.                                   
              The Task Force will make recommendations on alternative general                
              chemistry curricula, produce and publicize new materials                       
              through public presentations and publications, provide tested                  
              instructional materials, and conduct workshops on how to                       
              implement new curricula.  The aims of this proposed project are                
              to carry on two symposia at national scientific meetings and to                
              hold a summer 1991 workshop involving the whole Task Force that                
              will produce a report of accomplishments of the first two                      
              years.
