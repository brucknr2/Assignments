Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Mr. Don Herbert, also known as "Mr. Wizard", has entered into a                
              collaborative effort with Nickelodeon Cable Television for                     
              production and broadcast of 70 teacher workshops on elementary                 
              science education.  These 15-minute programs will feature                      
              exemplary hands-on science teaching, and will offer teachers and               
              school administrators current information on teaching methods,                 
              instructional materials, and models for managing educational                   
              change.  The programs will be broadcast over cable television in               
              the early morning hours for videotaping and later use.                         
              Newsletters and teachers guides will be produced and distributed,              
              and a toll-free telephone support system will answer teachers'                 
              questions.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Mr. Wizard's reputation as a science educator will attract a                   
              broad audience, and Nickelodeon will provide the means to reach                
              this audience.  This partnership has the potential to reach                    
              hundreds of thousands of teachers across the country, thereby                  
              improving their understanding of effective science teaching.                   
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing provided by Nickelodeon amounts to 35% of the NSF                 
              support for this project.
