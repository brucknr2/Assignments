Abstract    :
              A general chemistry lecture and laboratory course will be                      
              developed that is more meaningful, useful, exciting, enjoyable                 
              and relevant to today's college students.  These goals will be                 
              accomplished by introducing significant amounts of organic and                 
              polymer chemistry, environmental and descriptive chemistry, and                
              lecture demonstrations.  Several modern educational                            
              methodologies and technologies involving use of computers will                 
              also be employed.  The major effort of the project will be the                 
              design, integration, collection, testing, and writing of the                   
              materials that will comprise new texts for lecture and                         
              laboratory.
