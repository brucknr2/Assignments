Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The museum of Science proposes to travel a 3,000 square foot                   
              exhibit entitled "Bogs".  The exhibit will introduce a poorly                  
              understood habitat, acidic wetlands, in an interdisciplinary                   
              way.  the peculiar physical features of bogs has led to a                      
              popular view of them as fearful and unhealthy places.  This view               
              has led in turn, to their destruction.  To show the value of                   
              bogs, the exhibit will display their unique natural history.  In               
              addition, the exhibit will explore the relationship between                    
              people and bogs in modern and pre-historic times. in Europe and                
              in North America.  The exhibit will debut at the Museum of                     
              Science, and then tour to other museums in North America.
