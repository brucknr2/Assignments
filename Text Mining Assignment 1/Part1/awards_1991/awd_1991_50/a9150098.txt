Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to develop and distribute a                     
              complete kit for starting and conducting an intervention                       
              program for high school students, particularly minorities                      
              and women, considering a career in science and mathematics.                    
              This kit, based on the San Antonio Prefreshman Engineering                     
              Program (PREP), will consist of curriculum materials and                       
              operational materials.  The textual materials will include                     
              modules in Logic and its Application to Mathematics, Problem                   
              Solving, Introduction to Engineering, Computer Science,                        
              Algebraic Structures, Introduction to Physics, Introduction                    
              to Technical Writing, and Introduction to Probability and                      
              Statistics--all of which are academic components in the                        
              first, second, or third year of PREP and were developed by                     
              the PREP writing teams.  These teams consist of college and                    
              high school teachers as well as some of the students who                       
              have gone through the PREP program.  The operational                           
              material will include program brochures, sample application                    
              forms, follow-up survey forms, and statistical table forms.                    
                                                                                             
              Copies of this material will be made available at cost to                      
              those organizations interested in starting such an                             
              intervention program.                                                          
                                                                                             
              There will be a two day workshop and a summer intern program                   
              to help those schools interested in such an intervention                       
              program.
