Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Education Commission of the States (ECS), with the assistance of           
              the Mathematical Sciences Education Board (MSEB), and the Association          
              of State Supervisors of Mathematics (ASSM) plans to link the major             
              reform efforts of the mathematics community with state-level policy            
              makers.  This two-year project will increase the effectiveness of              
              mathematics education reform by preparing mathematics leaders to               
              participate in state education policy making, translating proposed             
              reforms into appropriate state policies and actions, and linking key           
              mathematics educators with networks of state-level policy makers.              
              Although the focus is on mathematics education, the infra-structure            
              will be extended to science education during the course of the                 
              project.  The implementation plan includes components on public                
              awareness, data on education policies and reform efforts by state,             
              enhancement of education leadership activities, networking, and                
              technical assistance to the states.
