Abstract    :
              Oberlin College is developing two laboratory-based introductory                
              courses for the computer science major.  The courses generally                 
              follow the outline suggested by the ACM Curricular Committee on                
              Computer Science, but give more emphasis to algorithms and                     
              conceptual development of the introductory material.  The                      
              Laboratory sections are used to make the courses more realistic                
              introductions to the broad range of topics covered in computer                 
              science, and to speed up and enhance the students' learning of                 
              some technical matters that require hands-on experience.  The                  
              objective is to make the courses more interesting, more useful,                
              and more accurate reflections of the field, and to have a                      
              positive effect on the number of women and minorities majoring                 
              in computer science.
