Abstract    :
              This project develops innovative materials and methods for                     
              teaching communication skills in a variety of engineering                      
              courses from the first through senior years. The project                       
              integrates the teaching of communication skills with the                       
              teaching of the problem solving skills typical in engineering.                 
              Instructional materials that can be used by engineering faculty                
              themselves, including non-native speakers of English, are                      
              produced.  To supplement present methods of teaching                           
              communication skills and to address unmet needs, "communication                
              skills modules" that engineering professors can use in their                   
              courses without significant extra effort on their part and                     
              indeed that will complement instruction in engineering problem                 
              solving skills, are developed. The modules address written,                    
              oral, visual, and interpersonal communication skills.  The                     
              project provides a prototype for modification of the                           
              engineering curriculum to teach communication skills in                        
              engineering courses.
