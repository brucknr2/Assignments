Abstract    :
              This project will develop a series of eight to ten Modular                     
              Experience Units (MEUs) which will replace the more traditional                
              introductory-chemistry laboratory experiences.  The MEUs will                  
              be relatively self-contained experimentally based exercises                    
              requiring several laboratory periods each for completion.  Each                
              MEU will be designed around a topic of current, active                         
              interest, in which chemistry plays a key integrative role.                     
              High interest topics will be developed to stress the                           
              demonstration of the scientific process and to show the                        
              evolving integration of the sciences.//
