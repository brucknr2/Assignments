Abstract    :
              This project will develop interactive computer-based tutorials                 
              at two levels of difficulty for 21 major topics in Introductory                
              Chemistry.  The tutorials, for use by individual students                      
              outside the classroom, will be produced using HyperCard, a                     
              powerful Macintosh program for organizing and interacting with                 
              information and images.  HyperCard integrates high-quality                     
              graphics, sound, animation, and controlled test fields to allow                
              production of sophisticated computer-assisted instructional                    
              software.  Feedback on one such tutorial, "The Mole Concept",                  
              is sufficiently positive that we wish to generalize and extend                 
              the approach.  Aids such as printed cards and lecture materials                
              based on the HyperCard stack can be easily obtained, and the                   
              tutorials can be easily customized by individual instructors.                  
              The tutorials will be made available for the cost of materials                 
              and handling.
