Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The North Carolina Science and Mathematics Alliance proposes a                 
              statewide systemic initiative to bring together the public school              
              sector, the industrial-community sector and the university-                    
              technical college sector to transform science, mathematics, and                
              technology education within the state.  The vehicles of change                 
              will be ten Regional Partnerships which, under the guidance and                
              support of the Alliance, will work with local resources to                     
              address local needs. Cost sharing: 263%.
