Abstract    :
                   Leading experts in polymer chemistry and the teaching of                  
              general and organic chemistry will guide this effort to develop                
              instructional packets for the undergraduate chemistry core                     
              curriculum.  The project will operate in coordination with the                 
              ACS Division of Polymer Chemistry project in polymer education                 
              (POLYED).  Five chemistry faculty will be appointed POLYED-NSF                 
              fellows and will prepare instructional materials involving                     
              polymers for introductory chemistry for non-majors, general                    
              chemistry, and organic chemistry courses.  The packets will be                 
              for use of chemistry faculty who have little or no experience                  
              in the polymer area.
