Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              While at the professional level, the social sciences have a well-              
              defined body of tools to use in experimentation, at the                        
              undergraduate level, the focus remains primarily on the humanistic             
              roots of the disciplines.  The academy has long wrestled with the              
              problem of integrating theory and methods at appropriate                       
              undergraduate levels with scattered success.  Students seldom make             
              the connection between courses like econometrics and intermediate              
              macroeconomic theory.  Indeed, they tend to see econometrics as                
              just another course, rather than the heart of economic scientific              
              inquiry.  Similar stories are heard in geography, sociology and                
              political science.                                                             
                                                                                             
              By taking the method and theory courses separately, students do not            
              use method to reinforce theory and vice versa.  Beginning with                 
              second semester freshmen and sophomores, an introduction to social             
              science methods course would allow students to blend these ideas               
              from the start.  With appropriate laboratory exercises, students               
              would also have a broader understanding of the social sciences as              
              a whole and an appreciation for the similarities and differences               
              between methods used by each discipline.  This course will weave               
              quantitative method into the fabric of the social sciences.
