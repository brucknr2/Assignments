Abstract    :
              The project develops a novel one semester non-calculus based                   
              physics survey course "The Early Universe", designed to expose                 
              students, particularly first-year Barnard women contemplating                  
              a possible major in the natural sciences or mathematics, to the                
              most exciting developments in 20th century physics.  This                      
              course represents an effort by the Barnard physics department                  
              to secure the pipeline against potential losses of talented                    
              women physicists.  The essential subject matter is physics of                  
              the early universe, with the bulk of the course spent on                       
              cosmological and modern theories of elementary particles.  The                 
              final third of the course concentrates on Einstein's Special                   
              Theory of Relativity.  No knowledge of calculus is necessary                   
              nor any previous study in physics, only a willingness to employ                
              algebra, geometry and trigonometry to assist one's critical                    
              thinking about subtle scientific questions.  The laboratory                    
              component of the course is devoted to measuring the fundamental                
              constants of Nature, including the speed of light, Newton's                    
              gravitational constant, the mass and charge of the electron,                   
              and Planck's constant.NSF funds for personnel support, in the                  
              form of stipends for advanced Barnard undergraduates assisting                 
              in the course development during summer 1991 and equipment

              Mathematica-equipped Macintosh computers, permit a much                        
              expanded computational component to the Early Universe course                  
              that manifests itself in innovative laboratory, homework, and                  
              learning assignments.  NSF funds for equipment are matched with                
              funds from non-federal sources.
