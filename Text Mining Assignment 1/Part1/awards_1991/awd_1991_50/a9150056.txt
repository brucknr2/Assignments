Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Rhode Island proposes to create systemic change by establishing a              
              support system consisting of leadership teams in the department                
              of education, a cadre of ten science and mathematics specialists               
              located a five sites in the state, and building level teams in                 
              every school.  Ancillary goals include building a capacity to                  
              initiate and sustain change at the state, district, school, and                
              classroom levels; increasing the interest of women and minorities              
              in science and mathematics; and enlisting the involvement of the               
              community in the schools through the establishment of a                        
              partnership involving business, industry, parents, and the                     
              schools.   Cost sharing: 24%
