Abstract    :
              A prototype "ANEX" facility has been developed that allows                     
              lower division Civil Engineering undergraduates to compare                     
              ANalytical and EXperimental results of small-scale structural                  
              model tests in a portable, personal computer-controlled                        
              environment. This project is to refine and test the existing                   
              ANEX prototype and to develop an expert system that will act as                
              a trouble-shooter for student users when analytical and                        
              experimental results do not correlate acceptably well.                         
              Further, a "RIED" facility is to be developed and deployed in                  
              the ANEX facility to improve student skills related to the                     
              Reading and Interpretation of Engineering Drawings.  The RIED                  
              facility also helps students to correlate idealized small-scale                
              models with real-world engineering structures.  Plans to assess                
              the impact of ANEX/RIED on introductory structural analysis                    
              courses at the University of Missouri-Rolla and at the                         
              University of New Hampshire are to be prepared, and then,                      
              preparation for the disemination of the results will be                        
              initiated.
