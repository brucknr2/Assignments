Abstract    :
              This project is developing and disseminating a set of modern                   
              lab exercises in observational astronomy.  These lab exercises                 
              employ modern electronic imaging detectors (CCDs) and computers                
              to acquire images of a wide variety of astronomical objects,                   
              including the Moon, planets, the Sun, stars, nebulae and                       
              galaxies.  Introductory students will measure brightness and                   
              sizes of the imaged objects to gain an understanding of our                    
              universe, as well as experience the techniques of modern                       
              observational astronomy.  These newly developed lab exercises                  
              are being disseminated to other universities and colleges via                  
              site visits at which the equipment and procedures are                          
              demonstrated.  There is a network of users of this type                        
              equipment allowing the exchange of ideas, astronomical images                  
              and instructional techniques.//
