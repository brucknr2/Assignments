Abstract    :
              The goal of the course being developed in this project is to                   
              integrate mathematics-teaching and computer-learning into an                   
              applied science, meteorology.  The course includes both lecture                
              (three credit hours) and lab (two credit hours) sections for                   
              one semester.  It is being offered to university students at                   
              the freshman or sophomore level to fulfill natural science                     
              requirements.The recently upgraded Meteorology Lab in the                      
              Atmospheric Sciences Program at UNCA as supported by the                       
              National Science Foundation provides a high-tech environment                   
              for students to archive, manipulate, display, and present                      
              satellite/radar imagery and other weather information                          
              interactively.  Three specialized meteorological software                      
              packages (PC-McIDAS, The WXP, and UNAWIPS) allow students to                   
              fully visualize the development and movement of weather                        
              systems.Students have hands-on experience in lab sections and                  
              learn applications of microcomputers in meteorology.This                       
              multidisciplinary course maintains its integrity as meteorology                
              and offers students practical training in mathematics and                      
              computer literacy.
