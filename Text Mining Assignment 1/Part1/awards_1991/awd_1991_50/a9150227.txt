Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Institute of Science and Society at Central Washington                
              University plans a series of six workshops during 1991 on                      
              issues involving science and technology which are of current                   
              interest in the State of Washington.  The purpose of the series                
              is to inform public officials on critical issues where science                 
              plays a central role.  Thus, state legislators, city and county                
              executives, excutives in key state and local governmental                      
              agencies,judges, attorneys, the news media, and corporate                      
              executives will be invited to participate.  The workshops will                 
              be conducted at Central Washington University, the state                       
              capitol in Olympia, or other locations which are easily                        
              accessible or relevant for the workshop topic (e.g., hosting a                 
              workshop on radioactive waste at the Battelle-Hanford Pacific                  
              Northwest Laboratory).
