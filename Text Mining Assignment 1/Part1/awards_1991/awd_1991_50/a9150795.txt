Abstract    :
              The existing experimental work in general chemistry courses                    
              meets the stringent requirements of the discipline, but often                  
              does not induce enthusiasm in students nor motivate them to                    
              further study of science.  This project will reinvigorate                      
              laboratories by producing a guidebook for transforming existing                
              laboratory experiments.  The experiments are placed in a real-                 
              world context appropriate for the local community.  Students                   
              become "chemist employees" in the laboratory of a local                        
              organization (industrial, business, consulting, regulatory,                    
              governmental, etc.) and work on these experiments reformulated                 
              as current projects of that organization's laboratory.                         
              Technical details remain constant, but the "scenarios" give the                
              laboratory work new meaning.  Phase I of this project has                      
              already demonstrated that the idea works to excite students                    
              about chemistry.  Phase II will extend, test, and refine the                   
              approach, explore applicability to high school chemistry                       
              programs, and produce a general guide that will allow other                    
              teachers to transform their laboratory programs.  A workshop                   
              for 20 participants will initiate dissemination of the project                 
              results.
