Abstract    :
                   A national survey of science and mathematics teachers and                 
              principals will be conducted during 1992-93 school year for grades             
              K to 12.  It will obtain information about science and mathematics             
              course offerings and enrollments, teacher background preparation,              
              textbook usage, instructional techniques, and availability and use             
              of science facilities and equipment.  Information provided by this             
              survey will provide a third year measurement of science and                    
              mathematics participation to permit analysis of changes over time.             
              It will also provide new information on qualification of                       
              mathematics and science teachers, the amount of time spent on                  
              instruction, teacher objectives for science and mathematics,                   
              differences in objectives for students in different class                      
              composition, and about the availability of science and mathematics             
              facilities and equipment.  //
