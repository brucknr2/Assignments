Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  In 1988 and 1989, ASTC offered a seven-day institute                      
              for founders of new science centers, funded by the National                    
              Science Foundation.  The impact of these institutes was                        
              profound, making the difference between success and failure                    
              for several, and helping many others clarify and strengthen                    
              their plans.  Since then demand for technical assistance to                    
              new science centers has increased rather than decreased.                       
              Building on its experience, ASTC proposes a 3-1/2 year                         
              multiple-strategy program to provide knowledgeable,                            
              supportive guidance to the founders of new science centers.                    
              The elements are:                                                              
                                                                                             
                        (1)  a 4-day workshop on how to start a science                      
                             center;                                                         
                        (2)  a resource book on starting and operating                       
                             science centers;                                                
                        (3)  a network for new science centers which meets                   
                             at the ASTC annual conference for mutual                        
                             support and information sharing;                                
                        (4)  one-day workshops held in Conjunction with                      
                             the ASTC conference and planned by the                          
                             steering committee of the New Science Center                    
                             Network;                                                        
                        (5)  increased coverage in the ASTC Newsletter;                      
                        (6)  an annual progress report on new science                        
                             centers; and                                                    
                        (7)  on-going, individualized technical                              
                             assistance.
