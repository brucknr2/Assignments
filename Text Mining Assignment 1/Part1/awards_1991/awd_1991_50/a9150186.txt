Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council is                  
              concerned about the state of science education in the Nation's                 
              schools.  This project will address the issue of teacher                       
              enhancement for teachers of biology and the life sciences.                     
                                                                                             
              The Board on Biology will convene an expert committee to                       
              examine selected inservice activities currently available to                   
              secondary-school biology teachers.  Since biology is one of                    
              the most widely offered and most frequently taken courses in                   
              middle and high school, a focus on continuing education of                     
              biology teachers should have an impact on the quality of                       
              science education offered to most, if not all students.  The                   
              committee will consider important recent advances in biology,                  
              links between content and pedagogy, the curricula and teaching                 
              materials currently available, and the possible use of new                     
              technologies to improve teaching and learning.  Emphasis will                  
              be placed on collaborative projects and will consider ways to                  
              maintain linkages between teachers and scientists after the                    
              completion of the formal inservice training.                                   
                                                                                             
              Most importantly, the components of exemplary programs will be                 
              identified that can serve as templates for the development of                  
              future inservice programs for both public and private                          
              organizations.  As such, it will contribute significantly to                   
              the set of materials on biology education already published                    
              and disseminated by the Academy.
