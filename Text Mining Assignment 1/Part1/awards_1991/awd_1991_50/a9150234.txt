Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a three-year project designed to enhance the                           
              physical science instruction in all of the Pueblo, Colorado                    
              city schools, grades K-5, and to achieve a condition of                        
              equity which allows full educational opportunity for every                     
              child regardless of factors which have limited science                         
              achievement in the past.  The Pueblo Public School District                    
              No. 60 is among the highest ten in the nation in the                           
              enrollment of Hispanic children.  Seventy-two Leader                           
              Teachers will participate (1) during the summer in a 1-week                    
              Equity Institute followed by a 3-week Physical Science                         
              Institute, (2) during the academic year in monthly half-day                    
              workshops to prepare for classroom use of kit materials,                       
              (3) during the following summer in a one-day workshop with                     
              their principals to plan for the science inservice of all                      
              the teachers in their schools, and (4) during the second                       
              year of participation, in the implementation of their                          
              school's science inservice plan.                                               
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because it is a district-wide project designed to                      
              enhance in a substantive way the science teaching of Leader                    
              Teachers in all district schools, and because it                               
              effectively addresses equity issues in the teaching of                         
              science to children.  The equity component is modeled on                       
              the successful, NSF-funded SEER project which was conducted                    
              in St. Louis, Missouri.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 21% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
