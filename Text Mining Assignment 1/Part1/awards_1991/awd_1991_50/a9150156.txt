Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The main objectives of the project follow two themes:  1)                      
              the collection and assessment of several hundred life                          
              science microcomputer software programs for use by hearing                     
              impaired students, including examination of the differences                    
              and similarities between hearing and hearing impaired                          
              students using the same programs 2)  the dissemination of                      
              information about the results of these assessments.                            
                                                                                             
              These objectives are closely associated with the objective                     
              of increasing the population of qualified hearing impaired                     
              people going into the field of science.  By encouraging the                    
              use of microcomputers in the life of sciences, students in                     
              the 1000 deaf institutions/programs will benefit from the                      
              use of good quality software.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The project will use as subjects and evaluators hearing                        
              impaired students and professional working with these                          
              students.  The assessments will be made at Gallaudet                           
              University, selected schools for the deaf and some                             
              mainstreamed hearing impaired programs.                                        
                                                                                             
              The assessment will not only select the best programs for                      
              the hearing impaired but it will determine if the results                      
              may be generalized from the deaf to the hearing population.                    
              As data is gathered on these assessments, a wide                               
              dissemination effort will provide information to the science                   
              education community on preferred software programs for both                    
              the hearing impaired and the hearing population.
