Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The state of Florida proposes a three-pronged effort to effect                 
              systemic improvements in the teaching of mathematics and science:              
              (1) a restructuring of K- 8 curriculum around a theme of                       
              "Florida's Fragile Environment"and development of curriculum                   
              resource guides; (2) a restructuring of the state's elementary                 
              and middle school teacher preparation programs through the                     
              development of new approaches to teaching science at the                       
              postsecondary level; and (3) developing teacher and community                  
              support for these ?and other! systemic changes through                         
              interactive communications networks. Cost sharing: 170%.
