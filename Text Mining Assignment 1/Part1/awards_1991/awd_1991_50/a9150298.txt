Abstract    :
              A new formal laboratory environment for the introductory                       
              computer science curriculum is developed.  The infrastructure                  
              for this environment and the focal point of the effort on this                 
              project is a unique software system, DYNALAB, that supports                    
              extensive experimentation in computer science.  DYNALAB                        
              consists of a comprehensive library of expertly constructed                    
              Pascal programs, a program animator, and a user interface that                 
              makes DYNALAB accessible to the novice.  Students are able to                  
              retrieve programs from the library and execute them through the                
              program animator.  Pertinent program execution dynamics are                    
              displayed under user control, including current line of                        
              execution, variable and parameter values, recursive stack                      
              mechanisms, statement counts, memory cell counts, and others.                  
              DYNALAB serves as a national model for computer science                        
              departments that are beginning to incorporate formal                           
              laboratories into the introductory curriculum.  A series of                    
              laboratory manuals replete with experiments based on DYNALAB                   
              and DYNALAB itself are the products of this project.
