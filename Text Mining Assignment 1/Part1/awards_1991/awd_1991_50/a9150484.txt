Abstract    :
              Materials Chemistry will be brought into introductory chemistry                
              courses through the preparation of "A Materials Chemistry                      
              Companion to General Chemistry."  Consisting of text, problem                  
              sets, model kits, software, and demonstration and laboratory                   
              experiments, the "Companion" will show how virtually every                     
              topic typically discussed in general chemistry courses can be                  
              illustrated with examples and concepts from materials                          
              chemistry.  The introduction of materials chemistry promises to                
              revitalize general chemistry.  The new material will broaden                   
              and enhance the scientific and technological literacy of                       
              students as they learn the vital roles played by chemistry and                 
              chemists in our materials-intensive world.  Inclusion of                       
              materials chemistry in introductory courses will increase the                  
              number and diversity of high-quality students who pursue                       
              careers in chemistry and in its many related scientific and                    
              engineering disciplines.
