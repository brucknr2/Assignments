Abstract    :
              This project will develop a new biology curriculum for non-majors              
              which develops the knowledge base, the observational skills, and               
              intellectual study habits of students in an area of science which              
              will allow for continued learning without formal instruction; act              
              as an instrument to change student values; and will lead students              
              to a recognition of the interplay between science and public                   
              affairs.  To achieve these ends the PI proposes an experimentally              
              based curriculum for non-majors which focuses on open ended                    
              laboratory/workshop activities and de-emphasizes lectures and                  
              demonstrations.
