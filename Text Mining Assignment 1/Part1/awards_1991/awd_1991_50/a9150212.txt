Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Institutional and national studies have reported a                        
              diminishing proportion of underrepresented minority college                    
              students entering and completing technical mathematics-based                   
              degree programs during the past two decades.  Research by                      
              Uri Treisman has shown that an interactive workshop model                      
              based on academic excellence rather than remediation greatly                   
              enhances the success for many of these students in first-                      
              year calculus.                                                                 
                                                                                             
                   The present study examines the paths of workshop                          
              students throughout the course of their academic program,                      
              and the effect that the workshop experience may have had.                      
              This effect is measured in two complementary ways.  First,                     
              by the short term and longitudinal institutional data on the                   
              academic success of these students within their technical                      
              major, and second, by the impact that the workshop                             
              experience had on the student's academic career as defined                     
              and interpreted by the individual student.  Primary data                       
              will be collected at the California Polytechnic State                          
              University at Pomona.  Results will be considered within the                   
              context of comparative workshop data from other institutions                   
              nationally, including the City University of New York and                      
              the University of Illinois.  Conclusions and recommendations                   
              will be discussed as they relate to current and future                         
              interactive mathematics programs.
