Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The staff of the Center for Multisensory Learning at the Lawrence              
              Hall of Science proposes a three-year primary school general                   
              science project, the Full Option Science System, Kindergarten                  
              through Grade Two Project (FOSS K-2).  The project will extend                 
              the existing FOSS 3-6 program down to the early childhood years.               
              FOSS K-2 activity development will be guided by the same                       
              philosophy and theory of cognitive development that was used                   
              successfully in the FOSS 3-6 project.  The result will be a                    
              collection of eight topical modules, featuring multi-sensory                   
              activities that are technically and developmentally appropriate                
              for all youngsters in the grades for which they are suggested,                 
              and easy for typical teachers to use.                                          
                                                                                             
              The FOSS K-2 project will develop three major instructional                    
              products in conjunction with Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational              
              Corporation, two school districts (Vallejo and Mt. Diablo), and a              
              national network of test directors (10) and the schools with                   
              which they work.                                                               
                  1.  Eight teacher guides for the eight modules, including                  
              background, objectives, preparation, lesson plans, discussion                  
              questions, language and math extensions, and take-homes.                       
                  2. Eight complete student equipment kits, attractively and                 
              efficiently packaged, including manipulatives, student sheets,                 
              and study posters.                                                             
                  3.  Study posters and science stories to be read to students.              
              Study-poster books and narrative stories will help students                    
              transfer the content of the activities to every-day situations.d               
                                                                                             
              Special attention will be directed to making the FOSS K-2                      
              activities exciting for teachers to use with students.  The end                
              product will be a complete, developmentally sound K-6 program.
