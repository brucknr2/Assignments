Abstract    :
              Introductory, calculus-based physics is offered in a multiple,                 
              small lecture/ recitation section format at Union College.                     
              Through this project the traditional, historically oriented                    
              content of these currently closely linked sections will be                     
              replaced by multiple, unlinked sections whose contents will                    
              have different guiding themes.  Two prototypes are being                       
              developed under this grant: one based on space physics, the                    
              other on molecular biophysics.  The thematic approach is                       
              anticipated to clarify relevance of the basic physical                         
              principles which are the essence of the courses.  Other                        
              important changes from current practice are to lower emphasis                  
              on classical analysis and enhance qualitative reasoning.  To                   
              this end, use of computers, particularly modern multimedia                     
              technology, in classroom and laboratory as essential tools is                  
              a primary focus of the project.  Additionally, laboratory                      
              format is being reworked to encourage discovery work by the                    
              students.
