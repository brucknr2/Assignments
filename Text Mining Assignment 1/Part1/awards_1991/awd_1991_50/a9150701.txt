Abstract    :
              This project develop a new course, Problem Solving for Computer                
              Science.  This course is not a computer literacy course and is                 
              not an introductory programming course.  It addresses problem                  
              solving skills, knowledge of computer organization. and                        
              computer usage skills required for the study of computer                       
              science. The intent of this course is to increase the retention                
              of students who might otherwise be excluded from pursuing the                  
              study of computer science.  The success of this approach could                 
              have a wide impact on undergraduate computer science education.                
               With the development of an appropriate textbook and other                     
              course materials, this approach could be implemented in                        
              virtually any college or university computer science program as                
              it requires no modification to established courses in computer                 
              science.  The accompanying discrete mathematics course is                      
              already a standard requirement of computer science programs.                   
              The project seeks to:1. identify students who are likely to be                 
              unsuccessful in introductory computer science, 2. design a                     
              course which addresses the skills these students lack, 3.                      
              implement this new course, and4. evaluate the value of this                    
              course in increasing the success rate of students who take it.
