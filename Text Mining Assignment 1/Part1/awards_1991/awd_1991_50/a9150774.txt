Abstract    :
              The Introductory University Physics Project (IUPP) is designed to              
              develop and promote new models for the calculus-level introductory             
              physics course.  Key goals are a reduction in the number of topics             
              covered and the integration of contemporary physics into the course            
              content - all of which is organized around a coherent "story line."            
              Phase III of IUPP is directed towards model development and                    
              classroom testing.  Five models are being tested in classrooms of              
              2-year colleges, 4-year colleges, and universities that have                   
              expressed an interest to be test centers.  As these models are                 
              tested, each is being evaluated by a group specifically organized              
              for this purpose.  When the formal activities of the project come              
              to an end, the IUPP Steering Committee will publicize the results              
              and encourage the use of the finished models in other institutions             
              until commercial textbooks and other materials are finished and                
              become available.
