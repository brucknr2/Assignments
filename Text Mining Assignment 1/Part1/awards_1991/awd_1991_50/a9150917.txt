Abstract    :
              Although computer science has its foundations in mathematical                  
              theory, the two disciplines have drifted apart over the last                   
              decade.  Computer science programs place too little stress on                  
              theoretical foundations and mathematics programs emphasize pure                
              mathematics and service courses with little attention to the                   
              computational sciences.  This project brings the disciplines                   
              closer together with a sequence of four introductory courses                   
              that integrate mathematical foundations and algorithmic                        
              computation.  The foundations courses introduce abstract                       
              mathematical concepts that become the basis for algorithm                      
              development in the algorithmic computation courses.  The latter                
              courses use the functional and logical programming paradigms so                
              that students can directly implement and test mathematical                     
              concepts in the laboratory.  By stressing visualization,                       
              concrete examples, and practical applications in the                           
              laboratory, these courses make abstract concepts more                          
              accessible to under-prepared students than current approaches.                 
              This effort is the first year of a three year development; the                 
              first pair of two pairs of courses are being prepared and                      
              taught.  Products include text materials and software for the                  
              laboratory activities.
