Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, PA                 
              requests NSF support for a 5000 sf traveling exhibit on The                    
              Human Brain that is being developed for the Science Museum                     
              Exhibit Collaborative (SMEC).  This exhibit offers an                          
              integrated understanding of how physiological structures in the                
              brain relate to vital life functions and human behaviors.                      
              Senior members of the exhibit development team include                         
              distinguished neuroscientists who are locally available and                    
              committed to The Franklin Institute project; the team is also                  
              advised by a large panel of nationally recognized experts in                   
              brain research.                                                                
                                                                                             
                   Like all SMEC exhibits, The Brain will be seen by over two                
              million Americans during a 32-month tour to eight major cities                 
              across the United States.  During the 1990's -- "The Decade of                 
              the Brain" -- the proposed exhibit project is important and                    
              timely in its ability to inform the public about new ideas and                 
              discoveries in the many sciences of brain research.
