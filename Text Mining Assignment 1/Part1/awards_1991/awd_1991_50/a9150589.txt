Abstract    :
              The Student-Oriented project is improving introductory science                 
              coerces by 1)  developing new microcomputer-based laboratory                   
              (MBL) tools useful in a number of disciplines, 2)  developing,                 
              supporting, disseminating, and evaluating interactive                          
              introductory physics materials of the type developed in the                    
              Tools for Scientific Thinking project at Tufts University and                  
              in the Workshop Physics program at Dickinson College.  The work                
              is being extended to the learning environments found at large                  
              universities.  The flexibility of these materials allows                       
              colleges and universities to incrementally introduce changes in                
              the way they teach.  The project is extensively testing both                   
              individual learning modules and total curricula by working with                
              physicists from Dickinson College, Tufts University, University                
              of Oregon, Boise State University in Idaho, Muskingum College,                 
              Ohio State, Rutgers University, the University of Washington,                  
              and others.  Several criteria which will be considered in the                  
              evaluation of the materials include student attitudes toward                   
              science, level of scientific literacy, and conceptual learning                 
              gains.  Materials are being produced that work well with                       
              underprepared and science-anxious students and with non-science                
              as well as science majors.
