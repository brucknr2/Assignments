Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Activities that encourage middle school students to learn                      
              the concepts of science and mathematics by motivating them                     
              with real world situations or interest to them are to                          
              developed by technology education community.  The activities                   
              will use design under constraint - hands-on technology - (as                   
              different from hands-on science) to motivate the learning of                   
              science and mathematics.  The results will include the                         
              increased ability of students to apply concepts of science                     
              and mathematics to "real-world" situations, increased                          
              communications among science, mathematics and technology                       
              teachers and research findings on the role and effectiveness                   
              of technology-based activities.  The project uses teams of                     
              teachers to produce materials under the guidance of the                        
              principal investigators and science and mathematics                            
              educators.  Administrators will be part of the team to help                    
              work out logistical problems.  The materials will be                           
              disseminated by a commercial publisher.
