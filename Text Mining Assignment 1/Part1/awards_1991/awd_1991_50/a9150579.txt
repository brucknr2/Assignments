Abstract    :
              The proposed project provides an option for fulfilling general                 
              education requirements which is an alternative to traditional                  
              General Biology/General Chemistry/Pnysical Science courses.  Ferrum            
              College will institute a series of courses called the Science 2000             
              Progra designed primarily to help non-science majors develop                   
              confidence and competence in dealing with scientific issues.  The              
              approach recognized the importance of incorporating knowledge of               
              student learning styles and motivation into science teaching.  For             
              the general education science requirement represents the capstone              
              of a student's science education, not an introduction to a                     
              scientific discipline.  The student should leave such courses                  
              understanding nature of scientific inquiry and the ability of                  
              scienc eto address meaningful issues and concerns.  This grant will            
              assist faculty in developing and implementing the philosophy of the            
              course through summer workshops and release time to concentrate on             
              course development and to interact and assist each other in                    
              developint the new approach.
