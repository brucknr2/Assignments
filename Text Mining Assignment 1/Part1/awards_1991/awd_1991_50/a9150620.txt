Abstract    :
              This project improves the academic performance and retention of                
              first-year engineering students through the development and                    
              widespread implementation of a model "Introduction to                          
              Engineering" course.  Faculty from ten universities come                       
              together with individuals who have successfully delivered                      
              orientation courses to minority engineering students and other                 
              orientation course experts to develop a model curriculum and                   
              text material for the proposed course.  Each of the faculty                    
              participants  teach this course at their institution to a                      
              randomly selected group of engineering first-year students, and                
              the academic performance and freshman-to-sophomore retention of                
              those students is compared to that of the non-participating                    
              control group.  A disssemination conference involving the                      
              participating faculty and several California community college                 
              engineering faculty is held as a finale to the project.
