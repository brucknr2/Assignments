Abstract    :
              This project will prepare software and associated written                      
              material to introduce computational chemistry into the first                   
              two years of the chemistry curriculum.  Computational                          
              technology is one way to illustrate chemistry as it is                         
              practiced today.  It gives students hands-on experience with                   
              the models that we use at the molecular level in a way                         
              previously unavailable.  The software will enable students to                  
              carry out atomic and molecular electronic structure                            
              calculations on simple atoms and molecules that are discussed                  
              in introductory courses.  IBM PC and Macintosh computers will                  
              operate the software.  The software and written materials will                 
              be disseminated widely via organizations such as Quantum                       
              Chemistry Program Exchange and Project Seraphim.  Work will                    
              also be submitted for publication in JCE:Software and the                      
              Journal of Chemical Education, and to software firms that                      
              market molecular modeling (molecular mechanics) software.  This                
              inexpensive technology could be used by any two-year community                 
              college or four-year undergraduate institution.
