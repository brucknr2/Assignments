Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Minnesota Mathematics Mobilization, in cooperation with                    
              the Minnesota High Technology Council, plans a three-year                      
              effort by the education and business communities to advocate                   
              systemic changes to help implement national standards for                      
              mathematics in Minnesota schools and colleges.  The focus will                 
              be on higher education and its links to school mathematics,                    
              especially in the pre-service and in-service areas.  The                       
              proposed activities include conferences and workshops,                         
              regional meetings, policy summit meetings, and a newsletter.                   
              The proposal builds on the existing 6,000 member Mobilization                  
              which was established through a previous NSF grant.  Cost                      
              sharing is 73% of the NSF contribution to the project.
