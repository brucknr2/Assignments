Abstract    :
              There is widespread consensus on the crises in science                         
              education.  Too few students, particularly minorities and                      
              women, are graduating with science degrees.  Furthermore,                      
              students who take science courses frequently find them                         
              unengaging and they fail to understand concepts and underlying                 
              principles that represent scientific phenomena. This project                   
              proposes to develop a prototype, interactive multimedia system                 
              for introductory college chemistry using state of the art                      
              technology.  With this prototype, we will develop an initial                   
              unit on chemical equilibrium that will allow the user to                       
              operate on chemical systems and observe the results in                         
              integrated, multiple, simultaneous representations, including:                 
              chemical symbols, video of the reaction, molecular-level                       
              animations, dynamic graphs, displays of absorption spectra, pH                 
              graphs, and tabular data. The software and supporting materials                
              will be designed to make the large lecture more interactive and                
              engaging and to help students develop multiple, integrated,                    
              mental models of chemical phenomena.  We will examine the                      
              impact of the system on student understanding of and interest                  
              in science.  A subsequent comprehensive proposal will extend                   
              this environment to the entire introductory chemistry course.
