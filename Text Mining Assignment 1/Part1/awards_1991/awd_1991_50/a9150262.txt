Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The title of this proposal is "The 5C/5E Project: The Five                     
              College Education in the Earth*fs Environment, Ecology and                     
              Energy Project." This 3-year project offers a model program                    
              for middle school teachers who need scientific information,                    
              skills in using low-cost equipment and supplies, realistic                     
              management strategies, and help in integrating recent                          
              pedagogical recommendations. There will be two cycles, each                    
              with 60 teachers who will participate in a sequence of                         
              activities focused on the development of regional student                      
              research projects. The program includes: Spring introductory                   
              workshops, a 3-week summer institute during which teacher                      
              develop the student research-project plans using a regional                    
              sharing model; an academic-year program including meetings,                    
              a newsletter, and electronic bulletin board network, student                   
              fairs and congresses, and staff support; a 1-week summer                       
              institute to complete documentation and dissemination plans;                   
              and continuing academic-year support for student research                      
              projects and for local, regional, and national dissemination.                  
                                                                                             
              The project runs from March 1, 1992 to February 28, *@1995.                    
              The cost sharing is about 23*% of the amount requested from                    
              NSF.
