Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  The University of Michigan will carry out an experimental                 
              four year project, "Upper Elementary Science Teaching:                         
              Integrating the Knowledge Bases."  The project will design and                 
              integrate with each other two upper-division physical science                  
              courses for elementary teachers, an educational psychology                     
              course, and science-focused field experiences.  Problems in                    
              existing programs in which these components are independent                    
              and isolated from each other will be addressed by: integrating                 
              coursework in physical science, science methods, and                           
              educational psychology, b) providing extensive exposure to                     
              science methods, c) linking coursework to focused clinical                     
              experiences to provide a context for learning and practice and                 
              d) developing technological support to aid preservice teachers                 
              in integrating and applying these knowledge bases.  The goal                   
              of the new program is to enable new elementary teachers to                     
              teach science in a manner that will deepen student                             
              understanding of fundamental science concepts.  The ultimate                   
              aim of the project is to create a model program for science                    
              preparation of elementary teachers that can be adapted at                      
              similar large research universities.  To aid in dissemination                  
              of the project, exemplary materials will be developed                          
              including curriculum guides, videotapes, sample student                        
              assignments, and case studies of preservice teachers in the                    
              program.  The cost sharing will be 130% of NSF's contribution.
