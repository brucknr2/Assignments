Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project describes an in-depth case study of one science                   
              department of fifteen experienced traditionally-oriented teachers              
              as they undergo the process of large scale change from teaching                
              the sciences as separate disciplines to a scheme of integrated,                
              coordinated sciences to a target group of 1200 students (ages                  
              11-16) in the Comprehensive School in Newcastle upon Tyne,                     
              England.  Results from this study are expected to apply to our                 
              understanding of the use of diverse teaching strategies                        
              with mixed ability young people, tying school sciences as                      
              interdisciplinary.  (In some ways it is complementary to NSF                   
              projects in Scope Sequence and Coordination and Project 2061.)                 
                                                                                             
              This study has direct applications to the delivery of new curricula            
              in similar schools in the United States.  The Salter's Science                 
              curriculum which is the underpinning of the project has been                   
              developed in England and has aroused great interest here.  The                 
              PI, who is working closely with the head of the Chemistry                      
              Department and faculty from the Education Department of                        
              University of University of Alabama, will establish field test sites           
              here based on expressed interest by several US school districts.               
              The staff development, the management of change and other issues               
              will be addressed in the project results.                                      
                                                                                             
              UAB, University of York, Rutherford School and Tektronics                      
              Foundation are contributing cost-sharing equal to 76% of the NSF
