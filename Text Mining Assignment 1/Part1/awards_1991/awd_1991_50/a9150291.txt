Abstract    :
              This project performs pilot studies to facilitate laboratory-                  
              based learning of concurrent engineering concepts.  The learn-                 
              by-doing laboratory approach to teach concurrent engineering is                
              made possible by rapid prototyping technologies, in which a                    
              product design on a CAD system is transformed to its physical                  
              counterpart using either stereo lithography appratus, selective                
              laser sintering or 3-D printing. This project develops a                       
              comprehensive architecture for laboratory development,                         
              including equipment specifications, experiments, and curricular                
              recommendations which serve as a national model for adoption at                
              other universities.  The project develops laboratory                           
              experiments and case studies to teach concurrent engineering                   
              concepts with respect to manufacturability,                                    
              serviceability/maintainability, testability, quality and                       
              reliability during the product design process.
