Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, sponsored by East Tennessee State University,                    
              will provide a six-week summer program for each of three                       
              years for 28 teachers and 7 principals.  The participants                      
              will be selected in teams of two middle school science                         
              teachers, two high school science teachers and one                             
              principal all from the same school district.  The summer                       
              program will teach an integrated science curriculum                            
              emphasizing hands-on-science and problem solving as                            
              required by the new Tennessee State curriculum guideline.                      
              The participants will return to the schools to carryout                        
              leadership activities in the schools.  Altogether it is                        
              expected that 100 teachers will be served by the project                       
              each year.  The project will be coordinated with a previous                    
              K-6 project and thus a coordinated K-12 science curriculum                     
              will be developed in the target schools.  The NSF grant is                     
              being matched by local funds in an amount equivalent to                        
              about 30%.
