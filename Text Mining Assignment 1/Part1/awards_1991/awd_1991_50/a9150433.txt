Abstract    :
              Materials for a computer-based elementary statistics course are                
              being created using data sets from recent research in the                      
              biological, social and other sciences.  These materials will                   
              improve statistical literacy and encourage students to view                    
              statistics as an interesting and important means of answering                  
              scientific questions. Students are learning modern methods of                  
              exploratory data analysis (including those based upon computer                 
              graphics) and statistical inference. The materials address the                 
              practical and intellectual problems connected with the                         
              classroom use of computers and real data sets in the elementary                
              statistics curriculum.  Specifically, they include: (I) a                      
              collection of carefully documented data sets from recent and                   
              important scientific research ready for computer use, (2) an                   
              instructor's manual, and (3) student workbooks. Throughout the                 
              project, faculty and students from diverse institutions are                    
              testing and evaluating these materials.
