Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The American Geological Institute is planning a major effort to                
              develop geo-sciences curriculum materials at the pre-college level,            
              with the emphasis on grades K-6.  The project proposes a conference            
              that will bring together key players to help identify existing                 
              programs and materials related to the major effort and to establish            
              a clearing house/network to promote sharing of resources and the               
              effective use of new materials.
