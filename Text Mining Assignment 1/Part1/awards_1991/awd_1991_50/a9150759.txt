Abstract    :
              A course with associated laboratory is being developed by the                  
              Department of Engineering that will offer to first- and second-                
              year students at Swarthmore College an exposure to basic                       
              scientific and engineering principles through an exploration of                
              the acoustics of musical instruments as well as the acoustics                  
              of the human voice, structures, and the environment.  The                      
              intended audience is predominantly non-majors in the sciences                  
              and engineering, although attraction of students to these                      
              fields is an objective of the course.  Emphasis is placed on                   
              hands-on analysis by students of phenomena already within their                
              experience: how musical instruments (including electric and                    
              electronic ones and the human voice) produce their                             
              characteristic sounds, how acoustic waves travel through                       
              solids, liquids, and gases and are reflected, refracted, and                   
              absorbed, and how sound and its impact on the environment                      
              (including humans) is measured and quantified.  Associated                     
              laboratories allow students to explore phenomena on their own                  
              in a creative manner, working in groups of 4-5 students.                       
              Laboratories are designed to teach basic principles such as                    
              resonance, superposition, time and frequency domain                            
              representations of signals, wave motion in one, two, and three                 
              dimensions, and the mechanics of the human ear.
