Abstract    :
              Galveston College is modernizing its freshman/sophomore physics                
              laboratory with microcomputers, interface equipment,                           
              measurement probes, printers and data acquisition and analysis                 
              software.  New laboratory instructions are being developed and                 
              written to incorporate the microcomputer instrumentation with                  
              the current laboratory apparatus.  This includes measuring                     
              procedures and computer analysis techniques to guide the                       
              student to a better understanding of physics principles.  The                  
              use of a spreadsheet is being emphasized for data analysis in                  
              many of the experiments.  The spreadsheet serves as a tool for                 
              students to select and manipulate collected data, produce                      
              graphs and make theoretical comparisons.  The computer system                  
              expedites data collection, calculations and graphing, providing                
              more time for the student to analyze and comprehend the physics                
              principles involved.  The power of the computer system allows                  
              for more in-depth analysis and for new types of experiments.                   
              Careful consideration is given to the writing of the laboratory                
              instructions so as not to overwhelm the student with the                       
              computer operations.
