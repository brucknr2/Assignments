Abstract    :
              This project develops an honors introductory two-semester                      
              calculus-based physics sequence which goes beyond the narrow                   
              problem-solving focus of the standard sequence, and directs a                  
              considerable amount of attention to the historical context in                  
              which major physical concepts originated and developed.  This                  
              helps students to internalize these concepts, develop the                      
              ability to apply them, and recognize their place in science and                
              modern thought.  Such a pedagogical approach enhances                          
              understanding and captures the interest of honors students,                    
              thus making them aware of the challenge and excitement of                      
              physics as an intellectual discipline and career.  These                       
              students represent a small but previously untapped high ability                
              pool of potential physics majors having a high percentage of                   
              women.  Subject matter is organized about the following major                  
              themes:  particle motion and the structure of the universe;                    
              waves and the transmission of energy; thermodynamics,                          
              statistics and the gross structure of matter; electromagnetism                 
              and field concepts; relativity, quantum theory, and models of                  
              the microscopic and ultimate structure of matter.
