Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Florida State University's project will revise the                        
              science content and science education courses for elementary                   
              teachers.  Courses will be developed in chemistry, physics,                    
              biology, and earth science.  The themes of global change,                      
              Florida's fragile environment, and Science/Technology/Society                  
              will be interwoven into all these courses.  The courses will                   
              be taught from a constructivist perspective, providing                         
              students with hands-on group experiences in science and                        
              opportunities for constructing their own understanding of                      
              science concepts.  The diverse group of faculty that will be                   
              involved in developing the courses includes scientists,                        
              science educators, and experts in multicultural education, the                 
              history and philosophy of science, and linguistic issues in                    
              teaching science.  The University's system of Professional                     
              Development Schools will serve as the setting for the science                  
              methods course and field experiences, and the project will                     
              work closely with teachers and students at these schools.  A                   
              network will be established by the State Department of                         
              Education to disseminate plans and materials to other colleges                 
              and universities in the Florida.  The University's cost-                       
              sharing is 15% of NSF's contribution.
