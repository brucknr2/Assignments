Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Interactive science exhibits will be designed,                            
              developed, and installed in the Brookings Interpretive                         
              Center at the Missouri Botanical Garden.  The Brookings                        
              Interpretive Center is a new educational facility attached                     
              to the Climatron, a geodesic dome greenhouse.  The exhibits                    
              will be installed in one of five theme areas:  Tropical Rain                   
              Forest Biome, Tropical Rain Forests at Risk, Global                            
              Ecosystem, Desert Biome, and Temperate Biome.  In addition                     
              to the science exhibits, the project will develop a series                     
              of science demonstrations to be used in the Brookings                          
              Interpretive Center and will allow for additional signage                      
              and audio effects to be added to the Climatron.
