Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a benchtop gas                        
              chromatograph-mass spectrometer system for use by students in                  
              several advanced undergraduate chemistry courses and in                        
              Organic, Analytical, Inorganic and Biochemistry undergraduate                  
              research.  Biochemistry students are using the instrument to                   
              identify the amino acid compostion of polypeptides. the                        
              instrument is also being used to analyze air quality,                          
              characterization of reaction products, and organic structure                   
              determination.
