Abstract    :
              The Geology Department is developing ane approach in which                     
              laboratory and field modules, rather than classroom lectures,                  
              serve as the focal point for teaching the scientific method.                   
              Modules sufficiently broad-based to be relevant for students in                
              three introductory lecture courses in geology are being                        
              introduced. The independent laboratory course consists of six                  
              modules requiring 1 to 4 laboratory session. Each module has a                 
              theme illustrating the complex relationships which exist                       
              between seemingly disparate subjects. Students explore these                   
              themes through integrated analyses of a variety of materials:                  
              rocks, minerals, maps, satellite images, data sets, etc. The                   
              laboratory activities are interwoven with direct field                         
              observations.
