Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to develop a set of research-based,             
              classroom-tested recommendations for teaching genetics and problem             
              solving.  During Phase I, national experts in genetics problem                 
              solving and genetics education, problem solving in other sciences              
              and mathematics, and genetics will participate with exemplary high             
              school teachers in a convergence entitled "Teaching Genetics:                  
              Recommendations and Research."  The conference will develop (a) a              
              consensus of recommendations/alternatives for teaching genetics in             
              high school so as to enhance student understanding of genetics and             
              enhance the development of student skills for solving genetics                 
              problems, (b) a listing of the current research support for each               
              recommendation, (c) a research agenda for testing the effect of                
              implementing these recommendations in the classroom, and (d) a                 
              commitment from interested participants to cooperate in conducting             
              experimental studies that judge the value and practical                        
              effectiveness of the teaching recommendations.
