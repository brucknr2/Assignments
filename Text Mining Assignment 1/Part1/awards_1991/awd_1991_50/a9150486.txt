Abstract    :
              Because of the multidisciplinary nature of biotechnology, its                  
              incorporation into existing undergraduate introductory science                 
              courses, such as biology and chemistry, can contribute to the                  
              enrichment of these courses, as well begin to demonstrate                      
              lateral and horizontal connections between sciences which have                 
              been traditionally perceived as distinctly independent                         
              scientific disciplines. This proposal outlines a strategy for                  
              the development of high quality, creative curriculum models                    
              which will place emphasis on transferring basic core technology                
              (theory, research and experimental procedures) utilized in                     
              biotechnology and adapt them to fit within the structure of the                
              educational setting. The primary focus of these curriculum                     
              models will to be incorporate core technology, through theory                  
              and "hands-on" experiments, within a context that directly                     
              correlates and demonstrates relationships to recent                            
              developments and applications of biotechnology in such areas as                
              medicine, agriculture, forensics and industrial procedures and                 
              processes. The faculty participants will develop curriculum                    
              modules which will be implemented and field tested at their                    
              respective colleges. Based upon field test evaluations, the                    
              curriculum modules will be refined, modified and re-                           
              implemented, and will provide the basis for the development of                 
              a biotechnology Curriculum and Resource Manual for widespread                  
              dissemination to undergraduate faculty.  The project's overall                 
              strategy strives to help promote scientific literacy to aid                    
              students in making important future decision which will affect                 
              their personal lives, as well as stimulate and influence some                  
              students to continue in scientific studies.
