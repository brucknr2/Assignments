Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to produce professional quality                 
              tapes on mathematical topics for high school students.  The tapes              
              are to use computer generated animation and are to be structured               
              so that there will be interaction between the tapes, and the                   
              teacher and the students.  This is done by references in the                   
              workbook that accompanies the tape.                                            
                                                                                             
              The tapes are disseminated by a consortium of state organizations              
              as well as NCTM and MAA.  Further distributions occur by the                   
              efforts and with the financial support of various foundations.                 
              All material is made available on a nonprofit basis.//
