Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The American Association of Physics Teachers, the American                     
              Institute of Physics and the American Physical Society will                    
              develop an innovative, year-long physics course suitable for                   
              students in grades 9 through 12.  The course will consist of                   
              six thematic units - recreation, transportation,                               
              communications and information, health and medicine,                           
              industry, and home - that will revisit a few important                         
              fundamental physics concepts in a spiral approach applying                     
              them to new, real-world contexts.  The course will be                          
              consistent with AAAS 2061 themes, particularly materials and                   
              energy, and can be taught in one year or spread through four                   
              years.  The mathematical level of students will be enhanced                    
              in accordance with the NCTM Standards.  A constructivist                       
              approach and the use of cooperative grouping strategies will                   
              be incorporated in the curriculum design.  Students will be                    
              able to recognize and begin to understand broad unifying                       
              concepts of physics and technology, to gain an appreciation                    
              of science as a process to apply the concepts to realistic                     
              problem-solving and decision making activities, and to                         
              identify and evaluate personal and societal impacts of                         
              technology.  The materials will be developed by teams of                       
              scientists and high school teachers with support from                          
              cognitive scientists, curriculum experts, and technology                       
              educators.  Teachers will be provided with knowledge, skills                   
              and support to make effective use of the materials.
