Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              PROJECT PTRA-PLUS is a program of the American Association                     
              of Physics Teachers (AAPT) to provide updated instruction                      
              over three summers for 125 outstanding U.S. high school                        
              teachers previously trained to conduct teacher workshops as                    
              Physics Teaching Resources Agents (PTRAs).  Twenty-five new                    
              participants will be added to the group in each of the three                   
              years to bring the PTRA-PLUS complement to 200 by 1994.  In                    
              addition to an enhanced emphasis on physics content,                           
              particular attention will be devoted to increasing the                         
              enrollment and success of girls in physics classes and                         
              subsequent interest in the profession.  A second                               
              distinguishing characteristic of this new effort is the                        
              progressive movement to self-sufficiency of the PTRA                           
              program; AAPT plans to continue both the training of teacher                   
              workshops leaders and the administrative/logistical support                    
              of the workshop-outreach programs as the NSF funding is                        
              phased out.  Program participants will be required to                          
              conduct a minimum of five full-day teacher workshops per                       
              year in their home regions or states, resulting in some 2500                   
              workshops reaching as many as 50,000 physics and physical                      
              science teachers nationally over the three-year period of                      
              the National Science Foundation grant.  A comprehensive                        
              database fed primarily by an electronic network of program                     
              participants and maintained by the Project Directors for                       
              AAPT will assist in the scheduling, reporting, and                             
              monitoring of the outreach workshops as well as evaluating                     
              the effectiveness of summer training sessions.  Other                          
              distinct features of PROJECT PTRA-PLUS include the                             
              encouragement of partnerships between the participating high                   
              school teachers and college/university faculty and with                        
              teachers of minority students in their locale.  To further                     
              extend the effective duration of instruction and                               
              interaction, summer training sessions are typically                            
              scheduled for the week preceding the regular AAPT Summer                       
              Meeting, on the camps site of the meeting.  The first such                     
              session is scheduled for August of 1992 at the University of                   
              Maine in Orono.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 10% of the NSF award.
