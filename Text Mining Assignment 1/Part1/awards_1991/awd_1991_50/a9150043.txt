Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The State of Louisiana proposes a Statewide Systemic Initiative                
              to improve mathematics, science and engineering education. This                
              project, the Louisiana Systemic Initiative Program (LaSIP), will               
              be implemented through six initiatives: (1) Pre-Service--                      
              Curriculum for K-12 mathematics and science teachers will be                   
              transformed in light of the new goals and standards; (2) In-                   
              Service--Two NSF-funded projects for mathematics and science                   
              teachers will be adopted statewide; (3) Teacher Certification--                
              Recommended modification of certification for elementary and                   
              middle grades will be considered; (4) Curriculum and Materials--               
              Mathematics and science curriculum guides and materials will be                
              updated and integrated; (5) Educational Technology--Current uses               
              will be expanded, and new uses will be evaluated and employed;                 
              and (6) Professional Partners--Practitioners will make students                
              aware of the role of mathematics and science in careers.                       
              Cost sharing: 100%.
