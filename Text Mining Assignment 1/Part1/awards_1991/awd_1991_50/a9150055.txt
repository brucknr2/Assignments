Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The State of Montana proposes  a Statewide Systemic Initiative,                
              "Challenge 2001: The SIMM Project", designed to restructure                    
              mathematics education in Montana.  Building on momentum already                
              underway in Montana in the K-8 mathematics program, this project               
              proposes to: develop an integrated mathematics curriculum for                  
              grades 9-12; develop curriculum materials; incorporate the use of              
              technology; increase the number of females and Native Americans                
              involved in science and mathematics; establish new certification               
              and re-certification standards; redesign teacher preparation                   
              programs; develop an inservice program; develop a support                      
              structure for implementation of the new programs.                              
              Cost sharing: 161%.
