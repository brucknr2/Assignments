Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project provides a transition from Phase II to Phase                      
              III of Project 2061:Education for a Changing Future, AAAS's                    
              major reform effort for K-12 education in science,                             
              mathematics, and Technology.  Phase II focussed on the                         
              teacher enhancement aspects of Project 2061. The transition                    
              year will focus on activities to develop 1) alternative                        
              curriculum models; 2) blueprints for action on equity,                         
              higher education, parental/community involvement, and                          
              interactions between science and other school subjects; 3)                     
              leadership models; 4) a resource base; 5) computer-based                       
              curriculum design; and 6) implementation at Vanguard sites.
