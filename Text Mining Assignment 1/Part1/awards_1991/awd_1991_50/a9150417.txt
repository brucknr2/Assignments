Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to create a sophomore-level                        
              undergraduate course introducing students from a wide variety                  
              of backgrounds to the principles and results of linguistic                     
              semantics.  The heart of this course is a software "workbook"                  
              that presents the material in an interactive, graphic                          
              environment.  The course and workbook address various aspects                  
              of meaning, including its relation to word and sentence form                   
              (morphology & syntax), its relation to systems of mental                       
              representation (cognition), and the interaction between meaning                
              and use.  The goals of the course are to reveal to students the                
              complex internal system of internal rules and principles that                  
              underlie our abilities as native language speakers, to let them                
              experience some of the intellectual excitement that comes with                 
              discovering such principles and struggling to formulate them in                
              a precise way, and to encourage them to explore the computer as                
              a model of how we, as human beings, think and understand.  The                 
              results of this work will be of significant value in                           
              introducing undergraduates to the principles of scientific                     
              reasoning, in reaching students not otherwise considering                      
              science majors or extensive science electives, and in helping                  
              to foster interest and interdisciplinary exploration in the                    
              cognitive sciences.
