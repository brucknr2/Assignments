Abstract    :
              An organic carbon analyzer and an ion chromatograph are                        
              used in the environmental engineering technology program                       
              to supplement instruction related to water, wastewater,                        
              solid waste, and hazardous waste treatment technology,                         
              and assessment of water quality.  Laboratory experiments                       
              combined with lectures give students a thorough                                
              understanding of key environmental problems, the                               
              most modern techniques for quantifying them, and the                           
              applications and limitations of these techniques.
