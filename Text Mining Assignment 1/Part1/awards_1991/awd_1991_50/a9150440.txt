Abstract    :
              The project is developing materials for a course in                            
              mathematical applications as a modern alternative to existing                  
              precalculus and related courses.  The course is an introduction                
              to mathematical models at the precalculus level and is a                       
              counterpart to the mathematical modeling course offered to                     
              upper division mathematics majors.  The models developed in the                
              course are primarily based on discrete mathematical topics such                
              as difference equations, systems of linear equations, networks                 
              and probability.  It involves a considerable degree of computer                
              and/or graphing calculator work to explore the implementation                  
              of most of the mathematical models.  It also involves a variety                
              of live classroom experiments to investigate the accuracy of                   
              the mathematics in predicting the results of actual processes                  
              or to help develop mathematical models based on observed                       
              experimental data. The course features a series of student                     
              investigations to provide a real life dimension and provides                   
              students with the motivation and impetus to continue on in                     
              mathematically related fields by exposing them to the wide                     
              applicability of mathematics.
