Abstract    :
              This project will produce and test at least six new laboratory                 
              experiences for students in general chemistry courses.  The                    
              experiments will use computer-interfaced technology (IBM-PSL)                  
              in an environment in which students can truly experiment.                      
              Research Fellows on sabbatical leave will collaborate with the                 
              Principal Investigators to develop new experiments using the                   
              distance, light, pH, and temperature probes of the PSL system.                 
              The computerized data collection and analysis speed up the                     
              process of experimentation sufficiently that students are able                 
              to carry out more measurements, collect significantly more                     
              data, and solve more meaningful laboratory problems.  This                     
              work, combined with previous work, will create a critical mass                 
              of laboratory experiences using the computer.
