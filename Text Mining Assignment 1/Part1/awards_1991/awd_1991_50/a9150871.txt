Abstract    :
              Four senior investigators are coordinating the work of a larger                
              group to develop a collection of modules for teaching parallel                 
              computing concepts in various courses in the undergraduate                     
              computer science curriculum. Each module includes an                           
              introduction to the concept or concepts to be taught, a                        
              laboratory unit which enables students to experiment with                      
              programs which demonstrate the material for the module, study                  
              questions and exercises, and an instructor's guide.  The group                 
              will meet initially in a workshop and then will work                           
              individually on their modules.  The senior investigators will                  
              administer the development, and make plans for the                             
              dissemination of the results.
