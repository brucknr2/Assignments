Abstract    :
              A cohort of students is to be instructed by the principal                      
              investigator in four successive chemical engineering courses,                  
              beginning with the introductory sophomore course.  The courses                 
              incorporate a number of teaching methods that have been shown                  
              by educational research to promote effective learning,                         
              including inductive/global presentation, open-ended problems,                  
              problem creation exercises, cooperative (team-based) learning,                 
              and assessment and remediation of motivation and study skill                   
              deficiencies.  Two groups are studied: an experimental group                   
              consisting of students who experience the proposed approach for                
              three or more semesters, and a comparison group of students who                
              progress through the regular curriculum.  The products of the                  
              research include a detailed profile of entering engineering                    
              students--distribution by sex and race, high school and                        
              freshman year records, reasons for selecting engineering,                      
              expectations of success, and levels of confidence and anxiety.                 
              The objective of the research is to demonstrate that the                       
              systematic and repeated use of the methods listed above can                    
              have significant beneficial effects on academic performance,                   
              retention, problem solving ability, and attitude toward                        
              engineering as a curriculum and career choice. The effects are                 
              expected to be particularly pronounced for minority students                   
              and other students considered to be at-risk academically.
