Abstract    :
               Pilot Project: Introduction to Electrical and Computer                        
              Engineering Course at University of Texas at AustinAn                          
              introductory course in the Department of Electrical and                        
              Computer Engineering is being developed whose primary goal is                  
              to reduce freshman attrition by fifteen to twenty-five percent.                
              The major objectives of the proposed course are development of:                
              1) problem solving skills; 2) a better understanding of the                    
              relationship between calculus and physics and electrical and                   
              computer engineering; and 3) an understanding of the use of                    
              computers in problem solving.  In addition, the instructional                  
              material prepared for this course will be suitable for a                       
              textbook that can be used not only at The University of Texas                  
              at Austin, but also in similarly structured courses in other                   
              departments of electrical and computer engineering.  A pre-post                
              experimental design is being planned for the assessment of the                 
              course.
