Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, sponsored by the University of Alabama-                          
              Birmingham, provides a six week summer workshop integrating                    
              the topics of middle-school mathematics and science                            
              followed by a series of follow-up Saturday workshops during                    
              the subsequent academic year.  The 50 participants in the                      
              summer workshop will be paired with another teacher at the                     
              home school and both will participate in the academic year                     
              program.  The courses will be taught by teams consisting of                    
              a mathematician and a math educator and a scientist and a                      
              science educator.  The courses will emphasize both content                     
              and pedagogy with hands-on laboratory and field experience.                    
              In addition the teachers will be instructed in how to                          
              carry-on leadership out-reach activities and techniques of                     
              teaching minority students.  The target schools have a high                    
              percentage of minority students and teachers.  The NSF                         
              funds are being matched by funds from the University, the                      
              State of Alabama and the Mott Foundation in an amount                          
              equivalent to about 16% of the NSF grant.
