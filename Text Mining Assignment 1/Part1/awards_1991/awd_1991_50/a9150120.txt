Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project proposes to develop six Guides for teachers (three                
              each for elementary and middle-school grades).  Each Guide will                
              contain about ten hands-on science activities suitable for from                
              ten to twelve weeks of study.  The activities will present many                
              sciences and some non-science disciplines that are naturally                   
              linked and integrated by a research discipline that uses all of                
              them, SETI--"Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence".  The                   
              activities in each Guide will be organized to begin with a look                
              at the Earth, solar system, and universe, then examine questions               
              about life on Earth.  This segments ends with questions and                    
              imaginative constructs on the possibility of life elsewhere in                 
              the universe.  In so doing, they will present biology, Earth                   
              science, physical science, and other standard classroom taught                 
              sciences from a fresh perspective of their possible bearing on                 
              the existence of life elsewhere.  They will also integrate the                 
              sciences with some non-scientific subjects, such as art, history,              
              and social sciences, in a natural manner specified by the                      
              SETI/LIFE-IN-THE-UNIVERSE connection.  The activities will                     
              emphasize hands-on learning and how learning is acquired, as well              
              as subject matter, in a way that develops both communication                   
              skills and critical thinking.  We expect that the great interest               
              to young students in SETI, with the natural integration of                     
              subjects that it mandates, will upgrade students skills in the                 
              sciences and sustain their interest in seeking careers in                      
              science.
