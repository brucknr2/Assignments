Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This, three year, nationwide program provides opportunity                      
              for middle and high school biology teachers to spend a                         
              summer doing research, full-time, in a college or university                   
              laboratory engaged in research in cell biology.  This                          
              program emphasizes the identification of highly motivated                      
              teachers who will return to their home school and have the                     
              opportunity to have a continuing impact on the quality of                      
              science education through the design of innovative                             
              laboratory exercises and through the provision of in-service                   
              instruction for other teachers. Participating teachers will                    
              share classroom activities and information regarding issues                    
              in pedagogy and science education reform at a meeting held                     
              in conjunction with national NABT meetings.                                    
                                                                                             
              Emphasis will be placed on the involvement of female and                       
              minority teachers and on school systems that serve large                       
              numbers of minority students. It is expected that this                         
              program will have an impact on science education at the                        
              secondary level and have at least an indirect impact on                        
              career choices made by some secondary students.                                
                                                                                             
              An amount equal to 23.1 % of NSF costs will be provided as                     
              cost sharing.
