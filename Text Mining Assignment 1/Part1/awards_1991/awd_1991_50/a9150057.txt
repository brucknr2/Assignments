Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The State of Delaware proposes a Statewide Systemic Initiative,                
              "Project 21", to effect change in science and mathematics                      
              instruction and learning.  Project 21 focuses on three                         
              operational areas: (1) promoting continued culture change in                   
              schools and communities, (2) science and mathematics pedagogy,                 
              and (3) student performance assessment instruments.                            
              Cost sharing is 56%.
