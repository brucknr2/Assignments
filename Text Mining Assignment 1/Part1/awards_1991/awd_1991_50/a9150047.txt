Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Nebraska Statewide Systemic Initiative proposal aims to                    
              improve mathematics education in Nebraska's schools.  Although                 
              the core of the proposal is at the precollege level, the project               
              hopes to achieve higher University entrance requirements in                    
              mathematics and increases in the numbers of degrees awarded in                 
              mathematics (particularly to underrepresented populations).                    
              After solving the state's problems in mathematics, an initiative               
              for science education is promised.                                             
                                                                                             
              The project's initial goals are: (1) implementation of the NCTM                
              standards in elementary and secondary schools; (2) a revised                   
              elementary mathematics curriculum; (3) an increase in the                      
              mathematics requirements for elementary certification; (4) a                   
              distance learning project for rural schools; (5) greater                       
              integration of mathematics and science in secondary schools; (6)               
              a public awareness campaign to generate support for mathematics                
              education; and (7) a program to make mathematics education                     
              culturally relevant and learning-style specific.                               
              Cost Sharing: 85%.
