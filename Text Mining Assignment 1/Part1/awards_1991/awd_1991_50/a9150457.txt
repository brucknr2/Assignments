Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A prototype instructional system based on a hypermedia workstation             
              will be developed for introductory cartography courses.  The goal              
              of the project is to allow students to use an interactive system               
              which will provide a knowledge-based guided environment in which               
              cartographic theory and knowledge can be stored and used during the            
              map design process.  The system will use a high resolution color               
              display and will be linked to a set of examples (stored on                     
              videodisc) drawn from the cartographic literature and from the                 
              existing body of published maps.  These examples will be used to               
              illustrate options that are available to student cartographers.                
              Hypermedia technology will be used to structure the system and to              
              provide the framework in which design options can be explored.                 
                                                                                             
              The prototype system will focus on three problem areas: choropleth             
              maps, graduated symbol maps and map layout.  This system will                  
              enable students to systematically explore interactions among                   
              elements within these problem areas in a way that does not require             
              them to invest long hours in manually crafting examples.  In                   
              addition, the hypermedia environment allows the system designer to             
              select examples that are particularly well-suited to the                       
              educational objective of the system.
