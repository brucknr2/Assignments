Abstract    :
               Development of Science of Computing 1 and 2 Courses at SUNY                   
              GeneseoA two-semester introductory sequence of courses in                      
              computer science is being developed based upon an equal weight                 
              being given to programming, mathematical analysis, and                         
              experimentation, with the supporting mathematics being                         
              integrated into the curriculum.This sequence has the goal of                   
              providing a foundation so that thestudents can practice                        
              programming, experimentation, and analysis throughout the                      
              curriculum.  The first courses, Science of Computing 1 and 2,                  
              teach all three (and the supporting mathematics) in enough                     
              depth to allow this practice to start immediately.                             
              Programming, analysis, and experimentation are taught                          
              concurrently in the courses rather than in the traditional                     
              sequential manner.
