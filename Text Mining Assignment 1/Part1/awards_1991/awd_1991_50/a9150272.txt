Abstract    :
              Under a partnership involving IBM, the MAA and the NSF, eight                  
              regional computer laboratories are being established to serve                  
              as centers for dissemination of information about instructional                
              materials for use in undergraduate mathematics courses. IBM is                 
              providing the equipment and additional financial support and                   
              with NSF support, workshops are being conducted   to provide                   
              initial training for the managers of the laboratories and a two                
              day course is being held at each laboratory to                                 
                provide faculty from that region with experience in use of                   
              laboratory based instructional materials.
