Abstract    :
              This one-year pilot program for experienced community college                  
              physics teachers provides two curriculum development workshops                 
              during the 1991-92 academic year at two geographically                         
              dispersed community college campuses.  One workshop fosters the                
              approach of using microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL).  The                 
              other advocates employing conceptual exercises (CE) and                        
              overview case studies (OCS).  The workshops are derived from                   
              successful models that apply findings of cognitive physics                     
              education research.Each three-day workshop is led by two senior                
              university/college physics professors who played a major role                  
              in the development and promotion of MBL and CE/OCS.  These                     
              hands-on workshops allow community college physics teacher                     
              participants to gain knowledge about recent developments in                    
              these areas and  encourage participants to adapt or develop                    
              curriculum materials which incorporate this knowledge at their                 
              own community colleges.The main goal of this project is to help                
              community college students develop a stronger understanding of                 
              physics.  The impact of the workshops is reinforced afterwards                 
              by the establishment of a networking system employing                          
              telecommunications bulletin board systems and a newsletter.                    
              Extension of this program to additional sites in other regions                 
              of the country is anticipated.
