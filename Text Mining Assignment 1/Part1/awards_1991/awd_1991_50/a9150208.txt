Abstract    :
              This one-year project is developing an upper division course in                
              numerical methods that incorporates the methodology of advanced                
              scientific computing.  Until now the availability of these high                
              performance computational tools has been almost exclusively                    
              limited to advanced research and development projects.  This                   
              project is demonstrating the viability of exposing                             
              undergraduates to modern scientific computing.  The hallmark of                
              the project is the development of a library of                                 
              interdisciplinary case studies, so that students can study                     
              basic numerical methods in the context of a significantly sized                
              scientific or engineering problem using real data.  These form                 
              the basis of group project work by students organized into                     
              interdisciplinary teams.This NSF-funded project is the first                   
              step in a larger curriculum development effort designed to                     
              extend a theme of computation throughout the typical                           
              undergraduate science and engineering program, and in                          
              particular to bring experience in advanced scientific                          
              computation to undergraduates.NSF grant funds for equipment are                
              being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
