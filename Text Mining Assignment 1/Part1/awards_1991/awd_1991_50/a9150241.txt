              Physics                                                                        
                                                                                             
              During the 1991-1992 school year, the project staff will do                    
              an extensive literature review and resource search, will                       
              develop communication linkages with other physics educators                    
              working with spreadsheet software and data acquisition                         
              devices in physics instruction, will attend AAPT meetings,                     
              and will visit three other sites where extensive physics-                      
              spreadsheet instructional activities are ongoing.  Based                       
              upon this preparation, the staff will develop and field test                   
              three spreadsheet modules for delivery of high school                          
              physics content.  During the spring of 1992, a summer                          
              institute will be planned for 20 well-prepared high school                     
              physics teachers.  The teachers will be selected from school                   
              in the state of South Dakota and the 150 mile region                           
              surrounding the University of South Dakota.  These teachers                    
              will be brought to campus for a two-week 1992 summer                           
              institute.  The institute, presented by the project staff,                     
              will consist of training in the use of microcomputers,                         
              spreadsheet software, data acquisition devices, and                            
              communications software.  The 20 teachers will practice with                   
              the instructional modules developed by the project staff and                   
              will study instructional strategies appropriate to the use                     
              of computers in physics instruction and learn physics                          
              content using spreadsheets.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The 20 teachers will use the instructional modules and the                     
              instructional strategies during the 1992-1993 school year in                   
              their own high school physics instruction.  They will be                       
              provided consultative support by the project staff by way of                   
              phone, mail and electronic mail.  The 20 teachers will also                    
              be encouraged to communicate among themselves via the same                     
              methods.  Three regional meetings, hosted by one of the                        
              participating high schools and conducted by two of the                         
              project staff, will be used to support the trained teachers                    
              and to inservice other physics teachers in each region.                        
              Feedback about the effectiveness of the instructional                          
              modules and the instructional strategies will be obtained                      
              from the participating teachers.                                               
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 37% of the NSF award.
