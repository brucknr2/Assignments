Abstract    :
              There often exists a polarization of students in engineering                   
              programs.  Changing demographics have significantly increased                  
              the minority population, many of whom are under-prepared to                    
              meet the rigorous demands of the engineering curriculum.                       
              Simultaneously, engineering very often attracts exceptionally                  
              gifted students, including minorities.  This project develops                  
              a multi-faceted tutorial program for developmental students in                 
              the freshman engineering graphics class.  Peer tutors act as                   
              mentors, academic advisors and mathematics tutors.  The primary                
              purpose of the project is to increase retention of engineering                 
              students, both those who are considered at-risk because of poor                
              academic backgrounds and those who are honors students.
