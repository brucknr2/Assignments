Abstract    :
              Peer student assisted instruction and mentoring will be                        
              developed.  This technique has proved successful in college                    
              mathematics courses at this and other institutions.  Mentoring                 
              will take place in a bridge class between high school and                      
              college chemistry, and in the general chemistry course for                     
              science and engineering majors.  The goals of this program are                 
              to increase the number of freshmen completing chemistry                        
              courses, and choosing and completing a major in chemistry, and                 
              to introduce chemical problem solving to inner city high school                
              students.  The latter will include the use of estimates to                     
              solve chemistry problems, and the application of highly                        
              interactive mathematics software to chemistry laboratory and                   
              lecture instruction.
