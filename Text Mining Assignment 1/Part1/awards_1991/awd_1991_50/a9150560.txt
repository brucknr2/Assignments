Abstract    :
              A new interdisciplinary course will be developed that teaches                  
              quantitative skills, along with elements of logic, in order to                 
              help students become capable of true quantitative reasoning for                
              students not intending to major in science and technical                       
              fields.  The course stresses the cross-disciplinary importance                 
              of mathematics, science, and technology in a wide variety of                   
              academic and career fields, as well as their importance to the                 
              citizenry of a modern democratic society.  An especially large                 
              fraction of the student audience includes women and                            
              underrepresented minorities.  The project will develop a                       
              textbook and a package of computer courseware for use by the                   
              students, and manuals for the instructors.  Institutional and
