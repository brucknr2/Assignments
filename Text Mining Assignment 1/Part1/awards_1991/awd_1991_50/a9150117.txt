Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  STAT-MAPS will develop materials for teaching                             
              statistics grades 9-12.  STAT-MAPS builds on the experience                    
              and results of SIM-PAC, a previous NSF/MDR project, and will                   
              be done concurrently with STAT-LINC, a NSF/PTE project.                        
                                                                                             
                   The STAT-MAPS instructional design is based on                            
              experiential learning through engagement with problem                          
              solving activities.  STAT-MAPS begins with statistical                         
              foundations for problem solving, specifies learning                            
              objectives through its activities and provides materials to                    
              implement the instructional strategies.                                        
                                                                                             
                   The materials development plan provides for extensive                     
              class testing and review.  The expected outcomes are a                         
              student text and activities manual, and a teacher manual and                   
              teacher version of the activities manual.  The materials are                   
              comprehensive, giving special attention to the needs of the                    
              teacher as well as the student.  The materials are designed                    
              for use in statistics courses as well as providing units for                   
              other courses.                                                                 
                                                                                             
                   STAT-MAPS anticipates the commercial publication of                       
              materials and provides an evaluation scheme for its work.
