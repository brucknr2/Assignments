Abstract    :
              The investigators are creating a two-semester introduction to                  
              the principles and practice of mathematics for students at an                  
              average college or university who wish to study a significant                  
              amount of mathematics, including majors and minors in                          
              mathematics, computer science, and many science and engineering                
              disciplines.  This course is being designed as an alternate (to                
              the standard calculus sequence) route into the mathematics                     
              curriculum, one which stresses breadth and includes much of the                
              modern mathematics and applications which are currently                        
              "homeless" in the mathematics curricula of today's colleges.                   
              The Phase I design will be overseen by an advisory/editorial                   
              board and author team with a wide range of mathematical                        
              expertise, education, and writing experience.
