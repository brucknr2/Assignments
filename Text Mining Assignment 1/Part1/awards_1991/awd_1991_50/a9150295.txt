Abstract    :
              This project extends the tools of the traditional physics                      
              laboratory to include microcomputers and laservideo.  It brings                
              into the laboratory measurable physical phenomena from the real                
              world, such as athletics, or events that need time compression                 
              or expansion.  A MacII based workstation is used at IUPUI and                  
              one at University of Nebraska.  NorthPark and the New Hampshire                
              Technical Institute are equipped with IBM compatible hardwae.                  
              The workstations include a microcomputer with real time video                  
              in a window and frame capture capability, a laserdisc player,                  
              and a data acquisition board.  During the Fall 1991 semester a                 
              software shell and four laboratory exercises will be created.                  
              During the Spring 1992 semester all four labs will be used in                  
              regular physics classes at all four institutions.  The results                 
              will be disseminated in workshops at the summer 1992 AAPT                      
              meeting.  Help will be solicited to develop a complete set of                  
              lab exercises for the standard one year introductory physics                   
              course.
