Abstract    :
              Colgate is engaged in a major revision of its introductory                     
              calculus-based physics curriculum.  This is being done to                      
              address three concerns:  declining enrollments, inadequate                     
              preparation of incoming students, and low minority                             
              representation.  The first semester of the new curriculum,                     
              called Modern Introductory Physics, has been developed and                     
              taught over the past five years.  Organized about the theme of                 
              atoms, it presents to freshmen the central ideas of twentieth                  
              century physics.  This is a strong motivator, and the course                   
              has been well received by students.  This project is directed                  
              at development of the second semester curriculum.  The theme                   
              chosen, unification, builds naturally on the first semester                    
              material, easily encompasses the traditional topics of the                     
              introductory course, and presents physics as the great unifying                
              science.  The three sections of the course are Newtonian                       
              Mechanics, Conservation Laws, and Statistical Physics.  The                    
              course concludes by discussing the origin of the elements,                     
              bringing students full circle to the beginning of the first                    
              semester study of atoms.  Faculty expect to generate 300 pages                 
              of supplementary written materials plus eight novel laboratory                 
              exercises blending classical and modern physics.  An outside                   
              consultant will be employed to teach staff the methods of                      
              course evaluation, and the results will be reported in the                     
              published literature.
