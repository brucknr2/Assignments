Abstract    :
              Associated with the restructuring of the CSl and CS2 course                    
              sequence at UDC according to the ACM task force recommendations                
              for the Computer Science curriculum, support is being given to                 
              create software modules and materials to develop an integrated                 
              set of software modules and associated curricula material that                 
              take advantage of the computer as a teaching tool, and to                      
              implement pilot courses embodying this material.  The approach                 
              taken is designed to be especially effective in situations                     
              where students have minimal prior programming experience.  The                 
              material developed is flexible, topics-specific and highly                     
              modular allowing its adaptation in other frameworks, including                 
              tutorials, varied approaches to the first year of Computer                     
              Science, and lecture demonstrations.
