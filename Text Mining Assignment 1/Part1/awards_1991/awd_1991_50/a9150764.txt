Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the development of a multi-media                 
              simulation of field ecology experiments to enhance the                         
              scientific process skills of students in undergraduate biology                 
              courses.  To accomplish the simulation, a computer controlling                 
              a video disk will provide integrated real and animated images                  
              in combination with appropriate sound.  The environment chosen                 
              for the simulation would be otherwise inaccessible to most                     
              undergraduate students because of danger and because of                        
              significant time and financial demands.  The development should                
              be of particular use in providing field experience to                          
              physically handicapped students.  In the simulation, the                       
              student designs experiments to test hypotheses, collects data                  
              from images stored on the video disk, and then analyses and                    
              interprets the data in terms of the original hypotheses.
