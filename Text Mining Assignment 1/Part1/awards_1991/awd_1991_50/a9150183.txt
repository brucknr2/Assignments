Abstract    :
                   The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) will carry out              
              an evaluation study of the calculus reform movement in the United              
              States.  This evaluation study will include current efforts in                 
              colleges and universities to generate a reform movement and, in                
              particular, will consider the NSF calculus initiative as a model               
              for future curriculum initiatives.                                             
                   Information collected will include factual data on a wide                 
              variety of projects including all NSF funded projects.  An in-depth            
              study of a carefully selected sample of projects will include site             
              visits and on-site data gathering.                                             
                   Key issues to be addressed will include outcomes of individual            
              projects, long term continuation of projects, dissemination and                
              integration of results and future directions.  Simultaneously, the             
              effectiveness of NSF's program, as a factor in the reform movement,            
              will be studied as a model for promoting curricular reform.                    
                   Regular reports will be made to the mathematics community and             
              to other science disciplines.  Since the NSF initiative in calculus            
              is a large factor in the reform movement, and since this study is              
              of interest to NSF staff, NSF will be included as a recipient of               
              these regular reports.                                                         
                   Cost sharing on this award is $17,000 or 9%.//
