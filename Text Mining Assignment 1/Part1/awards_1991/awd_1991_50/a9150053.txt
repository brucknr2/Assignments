Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The State of Connecticut proposes a Statewide Systemic Initiative              
              to improve mathematics and science education.  The project will                
              undertake five interrelated components:  (1) The establishment of              
              the Connecticut Academy for Education in Mathematics, Science, and             
              Technology, which will be chartered by the General Assembly and                
              will set standards, assist local districts in reform, and serve as             
              an advocate for educational equity.  (2) District-level curriculum             
              reform and teacher enhancement, targeting especially 25-35                     
              disadvantaged urban and rural "priority districts."  (3)                       
              Activities involving higher education, including restructured                  
              teacher preparation and collaboration with the schools.  (4)  Math             
              and science enrichment programs for students and parents provided              
              by science-rich institutions, business, and industry.  (5) A public            
              relations campaign for public understanding of the importance of               
              education in mathematics, science, and technology.  Cost sharing:              
              105%.
