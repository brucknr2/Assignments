Abstract    :
               An Activity-Based Introductory Statistics Course for all                      
              Undergraduates An activity-based statistics course for                         
              undergraduates is being developed that draws from recent                       
              experiences at the secondary level and in industry, where                      
              statistics has been made relevant by focusing on the production                
              and analysis of data of interest to the participants.                          
              Laboratory activities are being created with emphasis upon                     
              modern data analysis and graphical techniques, student                         
              projects, case studies, technology, and innovative teaching                    
              practices that treat statistics more as a laboratory science                   
              and less as a subject for lectures.  This project is producing                 
              a cohesive collection of laboratory units for students of                      
              introductory statistics, along with reference, assessment and                  
              implementation manuals for instructors.
