Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent research has indicated that it is surprisingly difficult to             
              achieve conceptual understanding in many fundamental topics in science.        
              The primary focus of this project will be learning studies aimed at            
              fostering conceptual understanding, where individuals or pairs of              
              students are taken through a lesson sequence and encouraged to think           
              aloud during the sequence.  A specific goal of the project is to develop       
              exemplary lessons that can foster conceptual change in difficult areas.        
              A more general goal is to identify critical learning processes and             
              teaching strategies in successful science lessons that can guide               
              curriculum developers and teacher trainers in other science areas.  On         
              the basis of preliminary studies, we propose to develop a set of               
              learning study methodologies that use a combination of descriptive and         
              experimental methods.  In addition to whether students are learning from       
              the lessons, the studies will focus on identifying which teaching              
              strategies are critical and why students are learning from them.               
                                                                                             
              Major outcomes of the project will include:  (1) a set of exemplary            
              science lessons for promoting conceptual change; (2) new methodologies         
              for conducting learning studies in educational research; (3)                   
              descriptions of critical learning processes; and (4) descriptions of           
              general teaching strategies for use in science lessons in other areas.
