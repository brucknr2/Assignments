Abstract    :
              Since 1988 University of Georgia mathematics faculty members                   
              have conducted special calculus workshops to support students                  
              from traditionally under-represented groups (minorities and                    
              women) who aspire to scientific and technical careers. 'These                  
              workshops provide laboratory experiences concurrent with the                   
              calculus fence that is a principal curricular obstacle for such                
              students (and others). The approach centers on an informal                     
              collaborative atmosphere in which students help each other                     
              solve challenging and interesting problems with non-intrusive                  
              guidance by carefully selected and trained graduate and                        
              undergraduate student leaders. This approach -- with its                       
              emphasis on personal attention, and interaction with peers and                 
              more advanced students -- yields substantial improvement in                    
              both student achievement and continuing interest in                            
              mathematics.  Specifically, the calculus workshop has raised                   
              the success rates (in first-term calculus) of participants from                
              58% to 88% (and-from 54% to 92% for Black students). To broaden                
              and enhance this workshop experience for minority and women                    
              students, with an eventual goal of transferring its evident                    
              benefits to the larger calculus student population, the                        
              interactive Mathematica software environment will be employed                  
              to involve students in symbolic, graphical, and numerical                      
              explorations that bridge the gap between formal manipulations                  
              and the more conceptual aspects of calculus.
