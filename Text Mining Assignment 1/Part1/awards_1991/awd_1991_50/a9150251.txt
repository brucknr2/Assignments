Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will educate elementary teachers so that they                     
              will be able to improve their teaching of science and                          
              institute a comprehensive authentic assessment and                             
              reporting system into school districts of varying sizes and                    
              characteristics.  In these districts, as in others across                      
              the country, there is a strong need for alignment among                        
              what is taught (curriculum), how it is taught                                  
              (instruction), how it is measured (assessment), and how it                     
              is shared (reporting).  Too often student performance                          
              within hands-on science programs is not documented at all                      
              or is subject to being measured by standardized tests that                     
              often offer little correlation to what is expected from                        
              these programs.  During this project personnel from four                       
              Minnesota school districts (Minneapolis, Osseo, Duluth,                        
              Wayzata) will work in partnership over a three year period                     
              of time with the Minnesota Department of Education to (1)                      
              become knowledgeable about recent research and developments                    
              in assessment alternatives, (2) adapt and further develop                      
              their elementary science programs, and (3) inservice others                    
              in their districts to use these authentic assessment                           
              systems as standard operating procedures.  When                                
              successfully instituted, this program will have directly                       
              affected more than 1,500 teachers and 45,000 students.                         
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing will be 16 percent of the NSF portion.
