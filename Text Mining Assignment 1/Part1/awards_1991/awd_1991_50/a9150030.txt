Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The State of South Dakota proposes a Statewide Systemic                        
              Initiative to improve mathematics and science education.  After                
              thorough study of the literature and examination of exemplary                  
              programs in science and mathematics throughout the country, a                  
              state-wide group will establish standards and desired outcomes                 
              for mathematics and science education in South Dakota, using as                
              guidelines the recommendations of NCTM, MSEB, AAAS, and others.                
              School districts will be given assistance and incentives to                    
              analyze their curricula and devise methods for raising their                   
              programs to meet the new state standards.  Valid new methods of                
              assessing student learning will be developed and implemented.                  
              Both teacher preparation and teacher enhancement will be                       
              strengthened to encourage teaching for understanding and                       
              utilizing hands-on methods.  The initiative will stress increased              
              citizen awareness of the importance of mathematics and science                 
              and promote the involvement of parents, business, and                          
              mathematicians and scientists with the schools.                                
              Cost Sharing: 50%.
