Abstract    :
                   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development                 
              (OECD) is carrying out a series of case studies in science and                 
              mathematics education as a part of its continuing concern to                   
              provide more effective instruction for all of its populations.  As             
              the international community becomes more interdependent, not only              
              in economic activity, but in terms of environmental and other                  
              concerns, the degree of commonality held by the developed countries            
              in particular becomes more and more evident.  A key assumption of              
              the OECD Case Studies Project is that the context, characteristics             
              and implementation of an innovation that is interesting and                    
              important in one country will in many instances be significant in              
              other nations, as well.                                                        
                   The proposed project will carry out up to ten case studies in             
              science, mathematics and technology education.  The studies will be            
              selected with a view to representing exemplary practice in the                 
              United States.  The framework for the studies has been devised by              
              science, mathematics and technology education experts at OECD                  
              conferences (attended by U.S. specialists).  The actual work will              
              be carried out in the United States by the co-principal                        
              investigators and their associates, with the advice of a panel of              
              nationally recognized experts in science, mathematics and                      
              technology education.
