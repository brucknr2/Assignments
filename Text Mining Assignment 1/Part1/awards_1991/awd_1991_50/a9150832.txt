Abstract    :
              A two year project to develop and implement two introductory                   
              lab courses in psychology is proposed as a vehicle for                         
              improving scientific and technological literacy and for                        
              attracting students to science careers.  The project includes                  
              the development of twenty lab exercises, which facilitate                      
              development of scientific thinking and demonstrate the process                 
              of science in the context of demonstrable psychological                        
              phenomena.  In the second year the labs will be implemented,                   
              and a laboratory manual produced.
