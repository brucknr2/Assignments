Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              New and developing science centers make up a significant                       
              percentage of ASTC membership.  They often have limited                        
              funds, facilities, exhibits, education programs and                            
              experience developing and operating a science center.  These                   
              institutions desire ready-to-use exhibits, demonstrations                      
              and education materials, as well as management workshops                       
              concerning the basic operation of a science center.  This                      
              project proposes the formation of a Science Carnival                           
              Consortia, a partnership of the Pacific Science Center and                     
              five to eight new and developing science centers.  Building                    
              on the success of the Pacific Science Center's Science                         
              Carnival, Consortia members:                                                   
                                                                                             
                (1)  Obtain twenty to forty Science Carnival exhibits                        
                (2)  Obtain six ready-to-use demonstrations                                  
                (3)  Obtain supplementary education materials                                
                (4)  Obtain appropriate training regarding the                               
                     implementation and maintenance of the above items                       
                (5)  Participate in a week long management workshop at the                   
                     Pacific Science Center                                                  
                (6)  Receive ongoing consultation with Pacific Science                       
                     Center Staff                                                            
                (7)  Participate in three annual meetings of Consortia

              The project also produces a Science Carnival "cookbook"                        
              which provides instructional for fabricating and maintaining                   
              all exhibits in Science Carnival, plus scripts and material                    
              lists for each demonstration, and enrichment class.  The                       
              project also evaluates the success of this model for serving                   
              other new and developing science centers.
