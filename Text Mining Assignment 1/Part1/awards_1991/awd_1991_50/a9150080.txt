Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports 30 U.S. high school and                                  
              college/university physics teachers in the participation at                    
              the second U.S./Japan/China Conference to be held in Japan                     
              July 23-28, 1991.  The focus of the conference is the                          
              interface between high school and college/unversity physics                    
              teaching and the U.S. delegation will pay particular attention                 
              to successful methods used in both Japan and China.  Post-                     
              conference networking and dissemination activities are                         
              included in the project.
