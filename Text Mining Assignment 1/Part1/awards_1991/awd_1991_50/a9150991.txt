Abstract    :
              Incorporating gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) into                
              the curriculum at all levels will create relevant, project-                    
              style experiments that will increase the attractiveness of                     
              chemistry.  General students will extract local soil and                       
              analyze it for ethalfluralin, a cotton herbicide.  Allied                      
              health students will explore the diagnosis of Refsum's disease.                
              General chemistry students will discover for themselves the                    
              principle of isotopic distribution and the determination of                    
              molecular formula.  Students in organic chemistry,                             
              biochemistry, and instrumental analysis will use the GC/MS                     
              intensively for novel experiments.  Undergraduate research                     
              efforts will also be enhanced.  The grantee will match the NSF                 
              grant from non-Federal sources.
