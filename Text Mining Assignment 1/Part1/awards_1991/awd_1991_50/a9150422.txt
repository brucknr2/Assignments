Abstract    :
              The project is developing afreshman honors course in                           
              combinatorics.  This coursestresses experimentation and                        
              discovery as methodsfor learning. The course is centered around                
              a long list of combinatorial problems that the students are                    
              challenged to solve. The problems are understandable with                      
              little or no technical background; nontrivial--leading to                      
              important mathematical ideas; and can be explored through                      
              experimentation.
