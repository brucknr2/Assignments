Abstract    :
              Various units for the lecture parts of the courses will be                     
              developed, refined and expanded.  Units such as these with a                   
              "case" oriented approach have been shown to stimulate the                      
              interest of students in chemistry, but many more are necessary                 
              for this course and for other introductory chemistry courses.
