Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests financial support to conduct research                   
              related to the literature on alternative practices in assessing                
              student performance in mathematics at the pre college level.  This             
              research is in preparation for the MSED national summit on                     
              assessment which, itself, will raise further research issues.
