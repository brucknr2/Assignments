Abstract    :
              This project focuses on a novel merger of the fundamentals of                  
              computation and engineering design at the introductory level in                
              undergraduate engineering education.  Such a merger replaces                   
              the teaching of rapidly obsolescent technical skills                           
              (programming and drafting/CAD) with a rigorous, fundamental                    
              indoctrination in an accepted, sound, engineering design                       
              methodology. The controlled introduction of the fundamentals of                
              computation and software design indoctrinates and illuminates                  
              the principles of good engineering design.
