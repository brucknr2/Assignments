Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the development, testing and                     
              dissemination of two environmental science courses targeted at                 
              freshman and sophomore students.  The focus of the courses will                
              be local environmental issues, with emphasis on original research              
              projects that involve collection of data in the field.  Although               
              the topics and methodology will be identified by faculty, the                  
              research will be real in that its outcome will not be known ahead              
              of time.  The applicants expect to combine knowledge and                       
              techniques from diverse areas of science (biology, chemistry,                  
              geology, and political science) in developing a truly                          
              multidisciplinary program.  Funds will also enable the hiring of               
              a recent graduate who will aid in course development and                       
              instruction.  The applicants expect that the courses will figure               
              in development of a Masters in Science Education program now                   
              being planned by a consortium of five colleges in the Amherst                  
              area.
