Abstract    :
              Graphing calculators are being introduced in an Intermediate                   
              Algebra course which presents algebra in the integrated context                
              of graphs and functions. A central component of the course is                  
              the use of the calculator in exploratory laboratory projects.                  
              The course will be designed in such a way as to attempt to                     
              increase the number of women and minorities who choose to study                
              precalculus and calculus.
