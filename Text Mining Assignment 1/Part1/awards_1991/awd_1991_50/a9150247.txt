Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will enable 20 physics educators from the                         
              United States to attend the Second Inter-American Conference                   
              on Physics Education to be held in Caracas, Venezuela from                     
              July 14-20, 1991.  The daily thematic design of the                            
              conference includes: Contents of Physics Teaching, Cognitive                   
              Processes and Problem Solving, Physics Teaching and Society,                   
              Experimental Physics and its Teaching, and Alternative ways                    
              for Communicating Physics and Physics Teaching.  Research in                   
              physics education will be highlighted.  Strong contributions                   
              to the quality of physics teaching in the U.S. is expected                     
              from the Latin-American contingent.  They have demonstrated                    
              expertise in developing simple and inexpensive equipment as                    
              part of their approach to the teaching of ethnic groups                        
              similar in make-up to U.S. minorities.  Translation of these                   
              materials and techniques to similar minority audiences in                      
              the U.S. will be a focus of follow-up activities for the                       
              U.S. participants.  Post-conference expectations include:                      
              1) the peer-led PTRA Program type workshops to share                           
              "lessons learned", 2) the on-going stimulation and support                     
              for                                                                            
              and Training of Elementary Teachers (TNG-7 of AAPT), and 3)                    
              the development of Educational Partnership facilitated by                      
              AAPT.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 9% of the NSF award.
