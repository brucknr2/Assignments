Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  Kids Network is a telecommunications-based approach to                    
              elementary science which has been demonstrated to be very                      
              effective in stimulating students' interest in science and                     
              technology.  In this project, the Technical Education                          
              Research Center and the National Geographic Society will                       
              develop models for introducing Kids Network into preservice                    
              elementary teacher education.  In the first year of the                        
              project five institutions--Hampton University, Penn State,                     
              Purdue, Swarthmore, and UC Irvine--will implement, document,                   
                                                                                             
              and evaluate methods for utilizing Kids Network in such                        
              courses as science methods, learning theory, educational                       
              technology, and practice teaching.  In the second year an                      
              additional ten institutions will assist with refining these                    
              models and demonstrating their disseminability.  The project                   
                                                                                             
              will also produce a Preservice Educator's Packet providing                     
              practical suggestions for using Kids Network in preservice                     
              curricula, and a monograph containing articles by                              
              participating faculty examining the models and research                        
              results in relation to current thinking about elementary                       
              science teaching.  The cost sharing will be 20% of NSF's                       
              contribution.
