Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are to provide non-scientists with a                 
              deeper understanding and richer insight of biology, as well as                 
              provide the skills necessary to better assess and apply science                
              in their lives.  Knowledgeability, skills, and enjoyment of                    
              students enrolled in the course are promoted by placing                        
              biological principles within a more relevant context that                      
              complements the needs, experiences, and learning styles of the                 
              non-science majors.  Novel laboratory experiments and in-class                 
              discussions are utilized to develop problem solving, higher                    
              order thinking, communication, and collaborative skills.  To                   
              facilitate this process, innovative approaches utilizing active                
              and cooperative learning, and new delivery systems (videodisc,                 
              videomicroscopy, and computers) are incorporated as part of the                
              instructional strategy.  The changes in course context,                        
              approach, and delivery are accompanied by ongoing assessment                   
              and training of teachers.
