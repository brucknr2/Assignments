Abstract    :
              This project develops materials for computing in and out of the                
              classroom for engineering dynamics.   The project uses                         
              simulation and animation for the teaching of kinematic and                     
              kinetic phenomena. The materials developed are highly                          
              transportable due to the universal nature of the course matter                 
              covered.  The authors have shown that it is feasible to perform                
              these animations with inexpensive PC/AT-class hardware and that                
              workstation-class hardware is not required.
