Abstract    :
              This project establishes a microcomputer laboratory for                        
              Psychological Statistics and Experimental Psychology.  It                      
              increases the sophistication of data analysis and simulation                   
              possible in Statistics and it enriches the research experience                 
              of students in Experimental Psychology.  It makes the                          
              microcomputer and its associated technology central to the                     
              undergraduate experience in Psychology.  A cluster of 5 work-                  
              stations, a physiological data acquisition system, laser                       
              printer, and the hardware to link the cluster to the campus-                   
              wide network as well as statistical, simulation, and research                  
              software is provided by this grant.  The project ensures that                  
              undergraduates in Psychology receive rigorous training in                      
              statistics, methodology, and experimental design.  The                         
              computer-based experience provides the foundation and the                      
              framework needed for advanced study and research.
