Abstract    :
              A unique modular materials education package is being developed                
              which will be used by chemical engineering faculty and other                   
              instructors to teach junior and senior undergraduate students                  
              materials science, processing and engineering as it pertains to                
              chemical engineering.  Each module of this package includes a                  
              background information section, main references, solved                        
              problems, class demonstrations and larger experiments that can                 
              be performed in a classic undergraduate laboratory course.                     
              This educational package is being developed in response to the                 
              need of most Departments of Chemical Engineering to develop                    
              modern materials-oriented laboratory experiments and to                        
              integrate materials processing in their curriculum.  The                       
              subjects covered include a wide range of materials, from                       
              polymers and ceramics to microelectronics and information                      
              storage materials.  In addition, symposia will be organized at                 
              AIChE and ASEE meetings to disseminate the results on materials                
              and the approach to curriculum development to other departments                
              and faculty.
