Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to employ sophisticated and                        
              computerized instrumentation in a program of undergraduate                     
              environmental research and course work that is facilitated                     
              through the Cumberland Mountain Research Center (CMRC).  The                   
              equipment to be used in these activities include an Atomic                     
              Absorption Spectrophotometer (AA) with Graphite Furnace and                    
              Element Lamps, a Hydrolab Data Sonde 3 water quality sensor and                
              logger, and Polycorder hand held data recorder and computer.                   
              The instruments are used in 12 major courses of the curriculum,                
              reaching students in biology, chemistry, and wildlife                          
              management.
