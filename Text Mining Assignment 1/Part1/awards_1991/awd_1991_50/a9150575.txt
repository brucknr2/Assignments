Abstract    :
              The goal of this program is to develop an introductory-level                   
              course in engineering aimed at freshman engineering students                   
              but open to all students.  The new course, made up of a series                 
              of integrated teaching units, focuses on the total system                      
              within which modern engineering operates and on the centrality                 
              of innovation for engineering.  The course also introduces                     
              students to techniques for more effective communication through                
              written and visual means.  In addition to the teaching units                   
              and the course itself, a network of teachers is established to                 
              disseminate the new materials.  These materials introduce                      
              students to the scientific basis for engineering, the social                   
              context within which modern engineering arises, and the                        
              intimate relationship between engineering and modern culture.
