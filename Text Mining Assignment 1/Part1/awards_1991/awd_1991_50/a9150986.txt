Abstract    :
              This project is providing instrumentation and equipment to                     
              support undergraduate study in analog communications and                       
              electronics in the radio frequency bands.  The Electrical                      
              Engineering program at the University of Evansville has                        
              undergraduate courses and laboratories in place to support the                 
              study of concepts in analog electronics.  The laboratory                       
              component of this program is being developed to include study                  
              outside the audio frequency band.  The additional equipment                    
              being obtained includes RF signal generators, a tracking                       
              function generator, wide band amplifiers, RF voltmeters, 500                   
              mhz oscilloscopes, and fabrication equipment to support junior                 
              and senior level project laboratories in analog electronics.                   
              This capability allows the students to extend their labotatory                 
              understanding of analog electronics beyond the audio frequency                 
              range.
