Abstract    :
               Adding Breadth and Laboratories to the Introductory Computer                  
              Science CoursesThis project develops two modifications to the                  
              first two years of the undergraduate computer science                          
              curriculum in response to ACM recommendations.  The first                      
              modification broadens the focus of these courses from primarily                
              software development techniques to consideration of the breadth                
              of the computer science discipline.  The second change blends                  
              the use of scheduled, structured laboratories with the                         
              traditional lecture approach.  Students are provided activities                
              that require the concrete manipulation of the concepts                         
              discussed in the lecture portion of the course.  Project                       
              activities include the development and class-testing of lecture                
              and text materials to support the "breadth" approach to content                
              presentation.  Materials are also being developed to support                   
              the laboratory portion of the courses.  These laboratory                       
              exercises are sufficiently independent of the lecture to allow                 
              them to be used with curricular arrangements other than the one                
              being developed in this project.  The project includes an                      
              assessment component that attempts to measure the effectiveness                
              of the materials developed during the project.  Finally, the                   
              project will disseminate the results of the curriculum and                     
              materials development phases through summer workshops,                         
              publications, and presentations at professional meetings.
