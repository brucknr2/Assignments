Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The National Learning Center requests $31,767 from NSF in                 
              support of a conference focused on research on learning in                     
              children's museums, with a special emphasis on science.  With                  
              funds from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a conference is being                
              held in March at the Indianapolis Children's Museum.                           
              Participants are from these fields:  Children's museums,                       
              cognitive psychology, and education.  What will emerge are                     
              papers and a video that relate to how we learn in museums, how                 
              we can better design exhibits to support learning, and                         
              especially learning in science, a survey on permanent science                  
              exhibits  in children's museums, and a research agenda with                    
              researchers matched to sites with preliminary timelines and                    
              costs for a number of projects on how we learn, and learn                      
              science, in museums.                                                           
                                                                                             
                   All principals are contributing their time.  Rockefeller                  
              funds will pay for travel, hotel, and food.  NSF funds are                     
              requested to support documentation and dissemination which will                
              include a video of the full proceedings for study purposes, a                  
              finished 20 - 30 minute video highlighting key ideas.  The                     
              viseo will be transcribed and edited to produce a series of                    
              papers suitable for dissemination.
