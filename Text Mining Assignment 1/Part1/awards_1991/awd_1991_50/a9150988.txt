Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to provide juniors and seniors with                
              experience in cellular and molecular approaches to the study of                
              basic issues in development.  A refrigerated microcentrifuge,                  
              speedvac, and incubator enable students to prepare and use RNA                 
              probes in an in situ hybridization exercise; dissecting                        
              microscopes allow students to exam aspects of embryonic axis                   
              formation; and the regulation and determination of single cells                
              labelled with fluorescent compounds is studied using an                        
              epifluorescence microscope.  In addition, students use the                     
              equipment to carry out independent projects.
