Abstract    :
              Graphical Software to Enhance Visualization in Beginning                       
              Chemistry Courses    Dynamic visualization materials for                       
              instruction in beginning chemistry courses will be developed.                  
              The project will focus on graphical and animation techniques in                
              the Macintosh computer with "Director" software as well as                     
              SuperCard and Super 3D. The materials will enhance                             
              comprehension of the dynamic molecular processes that are                      
              central to an understanding of chemistry.  They will relate                    
              macroscopic behavior to abstract concepts and models.  The                     
              materials may be used as lecture tools, for lecture                            
              amplification/review, and as tutorial units.  The materials                    
              will be evaluated and reviewed at each step by a group of                      
              faculty members from research universities, comprehensive                      
              universities and community colleges.  These materials will be                  
              especially beneficial for students with poor science and                       
              mathematical backgrounds or weak communication skills.
