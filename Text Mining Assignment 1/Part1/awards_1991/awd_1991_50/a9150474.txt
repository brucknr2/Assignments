Abstract    :
              Faculty from seven institutions (four women's colleges, a                      
              former women's college, and two coed universities) will develop                
              a laboratory-intensive curriculum for introductory chemistry.                  
              Fourteen laboratory modules will involve students in beginning                 
              inorganic or organic chemistry for two to four lab periods                     
              each.  The project will design 28 modules in all, and each                     
              module engages students in projects in chemistry from everyday                 
              life.  They will be tested by undergraduate students from the                  
              consortium and local high school teachers, modified, and put in                
              place at those institutions.  Seven additional institutions                    
              will give the tested modules a trial run.  Finally, the modules                
              will be put in form for publication.  The results of this                      
              instruction will be judged on the basis of increased number of                 
              students taking higher level chemistry courses and staying in                  
              the science "pipeliine".
