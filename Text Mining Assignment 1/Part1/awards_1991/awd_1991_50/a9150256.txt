Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a proposal for "Inservice Teacher Training in                          
              Environmental Education."  The primary goals of this 12-month                  
              project are (1) to equip 600, mostly under-represented, K-12                   
              educators to teach environmental education (EE) in all areas                   
              of the school curriculum, and (b) to increase to 25 the number                 
              of teachers enrolled in the College of Natural Resources                       
              extended Master's degree in EE, and make it available to                       
              teachers across the state of Wisconsin.  The unique model of                   
              in-service teacher training developed in this project will be                  
              implemented as a pilot program.  The courses will be                           
              instructed statewide by EE educators who include teachers,                     
              district coordinators, and state education specialists.                        
                                                                                             
              This one-year project starts August 1, 1991, and provides cost                 
              sharing of 23% of the amount requested from NSF.
