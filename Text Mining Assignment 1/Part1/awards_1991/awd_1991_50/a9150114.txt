Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Six Through Eight Mathematics (STEM) Project is                       
              designed to develop a new curriculum for mathematics for                       
              grades 6-8, including a complete set of student materials,                     
              teachers support materials, and evaluation materials, STEM                     
              is designed to provide teachers with curricular materials                      
              which are mathematically accurate, utilize technology, and                     
              provide students with bridges to the sciences and other                        
              mathematical fields.  These materials will be designed to                      
              integrate communication into mathematics by providing                          
              opportunities for students to use reading, writing, and                        
              speaking as tools for learning mathematics.  STEM materials                    
              will be problem-centered, application based, and will use                      
              technology where appropriate.  Many lessons will be designed                   
              to be project oriented so that students work cooperatively.                    
              In addition, new evaluation techniques will be developed for                   
              use with the materials.  In designing the curriculum, staff                    
              will work cooperatively with IBM, McDougal, Littell and                        
              Company, and Texas Instruments.  After the materials have                      
              been pilot tested throughout the nation, they will be                          
              published nationally for dissemination.
