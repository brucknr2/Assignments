Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Principal Investigators will conduct an R and D                       
              project that will translate past laboratory studies into                       
              practically relevant instruction.  Their goals are: (1) to                     
              develop theoretically based, but practically useful methods                    
              and materials for teaching effective problem solving in the                    
              prototype domain of basic physics; (2) to increase                             
              understanding of the cognitive processes needed to learn                       
              such problem solving; and (3) thus to develop research-based                   
              guidelines for designing problem-solving instruction in                        
              other quantitative sciences.  The effort will use                              
              interactive instructional methods to teach explicitly a                        
              general problem-solving strategy, a well-organized knowledge                   
              base, and the decision and checking processes needed to                        
              apply the strategy.  The instructional methods, materials,                     
              and underlying theoretical models will be cumulatively                         
              improved by a sequence of instructional experiments,                           
              extending from small-scale studies to classroom contexts.                      
              In these the students will be observed in detail, the data                     
              analyzed (partially by computer modeling) to elucidate                         
              underlying learning difficulties, and the results                              
              systematically used to revise the instructional approach.                      
              Prototype instructional materials will be produced and made                    
              available to teachers and other researchers.
