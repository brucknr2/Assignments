Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Linguists have discovered that the verbs "define", "explain",                  
              "hypothesize", "infer" and "interpret" are absent in science texts             
              designed for the junior high school years.  These are metacognitive            
              verbs that imply active mental construction.  The statements in these          
              science texts give little indication that science is the product of            
              human talk and thought.  This project will conduct an experiment to            
              determine the impact of a simple intervention in which two groups of           
              teachers prepare lesson plans for a semester.  One group will design the       
              lessons around the use of the metacognitive verbs, while the control           
              group will use an alternate set of verbs commonly found in science             
              textbooks, such as find, prove, tell, show, demonstrate.  Teachers'            
              style of teaching in the classroom will be observed and analyzed.              
              Students will be tested on content mastery at both a factual and a deep        
              conceptual level.  The differences between the experimental and control        
              classes will be analyzed, taking into account a variety of other teacher       
              variables such as supervisor's claims of teacher effectiveness.                
              Implications will be drawn regarding modification of teacher behavior          
              through this rather simple device of emphasizing a few key words.
