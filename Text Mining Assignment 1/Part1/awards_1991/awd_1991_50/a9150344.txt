Abstract    :
              This pilot project incorporates computer assisted instruction                  
              into the introductory biological sciences courses at a college                 
              primarily for women, where no ethnic group is in the majority.                 
              The introduction of computer technology, including videodisc                   
              presentations and simulations, improves lecture and laboratory                 
              information delivery systems, and laboratory experiments                       
              incorporate computer technology in data acquisition,                           
              statistical analysis, and graphic display.  Interactive,                       
              individualized self-paced learning are available through the                   
              addition of computer software and hardware to the facilities of                
              the Instructional Media Centers.  A new course, Computing for                  
              Biologists, teaches students current applications of computer                  
              technology in teaching, learning, and laboratory research.
