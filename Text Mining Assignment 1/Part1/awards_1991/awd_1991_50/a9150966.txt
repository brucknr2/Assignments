Abstract    :
              Davison College is purchasing a 300 MHz Fourier transform                      
              nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer.  Students are                
              using the instrument in introductory organic chemistry to                      
              identify unknown compounds. Advanced students build upon their                 
              NMR background from organic chemistry to explore theoretical                   
              relationships, acquire and interpret the NMR spectra of more
