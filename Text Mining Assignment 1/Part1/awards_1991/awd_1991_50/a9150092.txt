Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Approximately 600 demonstrations will be recorded on                           
              videodisc for use in teaching introductory physics by high                     
              school and college teachers and at informal science                            
              programs.  The experiments will be chosen mainly from the                      
              collection at the University of Maryland by high school                        
              teachers.  The use of two channel audio will enable teachers                   
              to use the narration supplied or use their own.  Transcripts                   
              of the narration, notes on construction of demonstrations                      
              and information about the demonstrations accompany the                         
              videodiscs.  The demonstrations will be keyed to popular                       
              physics texts and a search routine will be available.  The                     
              discs will be distributed commercially.
