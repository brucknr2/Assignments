Abstract    :
              Resource materials for use in abstract algebra are being                       
              developed to support a mathematics computing laboratory. The                   
              materials and the laboratory allow the integration of high-                    
              level computing into advanced mathematics courses; courses,                    
              which to date, have felt very little of the benefits of                        
              computing. The materials are uses as teaching and learning                     
              aids, exploiting the power of computing to give students a new                 
              perspective on traditional topics. In addition, to show                        
              students that in research, engineering, and business, computing                
              is used as a flexible problem solving tool of immense power.
