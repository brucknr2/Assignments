Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is directed at the development of a cadre of                     
              Science, Technology, and Society (STS) teachers at the                         
              middle/junior high school level in rural areas of central                      
              Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia.  The goal of the                      
              proposal is to establish a cadre of STS teacher leaders who                    
              will have the ability to develop and implement STS units.  The                 
              proposal will also investigate the effectiveness of the                        
              teachers in disseminating STS materials in their own schools                   
              as well as to the larger community of science educators.                       
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 8% of the NSF award.
