Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop, field-test, evaluate, and disseminate               
              a three-year mathematics curriculum for middle school grades.                  
              The project is a joint undertaking of teams at Michigan State                  
              University (the host institution), the University of Maryland,                 
              and the University of North Carolina.                                          
                                                                                             
              The working title of the proposed program, Connected Mathematics,              
              has been chosen to suggest our interest in developing student                  
              knowledge of mathematics that is rich in connections--connections              
              among the various topic strands of the subject, connections                    
              between mathematics and its applications in other disciplines,                 
              connections between the planned teaching/learning activities and               
              the special aptitudes and interests of middle school students and              
              connections between the preparation laid by elementary school                  
              mathematics and the goals of secondary school mathematics.
