                  The North Carolina Museum of Life and Science requests                    
              $491,260 to develop exhibits which explore mechanics of living                 
              organism.  Basic physics, optics and fluids dynamics will be                   
              presented in the context of biological systems.  Life in a                     
              Physical World interactive exhibits and educational materials                  
              which will reach over 3 million people.                                        
                                                                                             
                   Life in a Physical World meets the needs of teachers,                     
              students and other science learners.  The exhibits and                         
              educational materials integrate science concepts across                        
              disciplines.  They provide hands-on, motivating science                        
              experiences in a non-threatening environment.  Life in a                       
              Physical World makes physical science concepts accessible by                   
              presenting them in the context of living things.

                   The Project will produce a 2,000 square foot permanent and                
              travelling Life in a Physical World exhibits.  The North                       
              Carolina Museum of Life and Science will install the permanent                 
              exhibition.  To ensure broad dissemination, the Association of                 
              Science-Technology Centers will circulate the travelling                       
              exhibition nationally and the Museum will distribute as-built                  
              drawings to science centers, natural history museums and zoos.                 
              Museum Educators will produce materials to enhance the                         
              instructional value of the exhibition.
