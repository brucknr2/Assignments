Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A three-year project, Science Experiences and Resources                   
              for Informal Education Settings (SERIES), involves                             
              collaboration between the 4-H Youth Development Program,                       
              practicing scientists, science education centers, and                          
              community service agencies to provide community-based                          
              science experiences for youth.  Goals for national                             
              dissemination of the SERIES project are: 1) Increase the                       
              quality and quantity of science experiences for youth as                       
              leaders and as learners; 2) For youth to actively experience                   
              how science concepts and processes relate to their everyday                    
              lives; 3) Provide opportunities for youth to take positive                     
              leadership roles in their homes and communities; and 4)                        
              Provide opportunities for youth to investigate educational                     
              and career possibilities in science and technology through a                   
              scientist mentor relationship.  SERIES builds upon the                         
              materials, and instructional/coaching model successfully                       
              developed and tested during the Califronia SERIES Project.                     
              National dissemination by 4-H assures SERIES availability to                   
              the 5,100,000 youth currently enrolled in 4-H.                                 
                                                                                             
                   Expected outcomes of SERIES are: 1) Refine and produce                    
              final versions in English and Spanish of four SERIES                           
              community service science units; 2) Develop two new units;                     
              3) Development of an "inquiry coaching" module for adult                       
              volunteers; 4) Develop and asses apprentice-like mentoring                     
              experiences for SERIES teens to work directly with                             
              scientists; and 5) Establish four SERIES regional                              
              dissemination centers, working collaboratively with 4-H,                       
              science centers and other youth serving agencies to provide                    
              national dissemination of the SERIES program model to 28                       
              states.
