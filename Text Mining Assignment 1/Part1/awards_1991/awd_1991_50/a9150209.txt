Abstract    :
              The Mathematical Association of America is developing and                      
              implementing model workshops at annual meetings of each of the 29              
              Sections of the Association.  The model workshops will contain                 
              three components:  a contributed paper session or panel discussion             
              featuring individuals rewarded grants for activities in pre-college            
              and undergraduate mathematics programs;  an overview presentation              
              highlighting designated NSF program initiatives;  and a workshop on            
              the preparation and evaluation of proposals.  The sessions will                
              disseminate results of projects supported by the Foundation and                
              stimulate discussion about current issues in pre-college and                   
              undergraduate mathematics education.
