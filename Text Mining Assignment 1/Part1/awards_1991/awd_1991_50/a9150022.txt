Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Teachers College, Columbia University, will carry out a                        
              project which will develop curriculum and create student                       
              teaching experiences at the High School for Teaching in New                    
              York City.  The High School for Teaching is part of a network                  
              of special-interest magnet high schools established by the New                 
              York City School System, and its student body is 88% minority.                 
                                                                                             
              This school attracts students from across the city who plan to                 
              go into teaching careers and develops innovative programs to                   
              support their career choice.  The goals of this project are                    
              two-fold:  (1) to give preservice teachers an outstanding                      
              field experience in teaching secondary science in an urban                     
              setting, and (2) to attract and enable high school students at                 
              HST to pursue a career in teaching science.  The University's                  
              cost-sharing is 11.5% of NSF's contribution.
