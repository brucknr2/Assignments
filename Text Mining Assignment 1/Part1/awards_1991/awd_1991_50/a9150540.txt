Abstract    :
              This project will develop and implement the second semester of                 
              a newly conceived integrated science course for elementary                     
              education majors.  This one-year course includes topics from                   
              chemistry, earth science, and biology in the first semester,                   
              and topics from physics, astronomy and meteorology in the                      
              second semester.  The principal objective of the course is to                  
              prepare students to teach science in the elementary schools.                   
              Thus, the lectures rely heavily on demonstrations and the                      
              explanation of natural phenomena through what is termed a                      
              "discrepancy approach". A major innovative feature of this                     
              project is the heavy emphasis on laboratory experiences.  In                   
              the lab, the prospective teachers perform hands-on activities                  
              which they will utilize in the future in their own elementary                  
              classrooms.
