Abstract    :
               The project emphasizes a better integrated approach to the                    
              teaching of courses in mapping techniques to undergraduate                     
              students in the Department of Geography, University of Georgia.                
              Through a suite of 15 carefully designed laboratory exercises                  
              focusing on the theme of terrain mapping, modeling and                         
              analysis, students will learn in a sequence of three 10-week                   
              courses the principles and techniques of computer-assisted                     
              cartography, photogrammetry, and geographic information                        
              systems.  The integrated approach allows a holistic treatment                  
              of these technique courses by the instructors and promotes                     
              understanding by students of the interdependence of these                      
              mapping techniques. The project recommends the purchase of 386-                
              VGA personal computers, A- and C-sized digitizers, printers,                   
              plotters, and a scanner in conjunction with software, such as,                 
              ERDAS/VGA, pc ARC/INFO, GRASS, ATLAS*DRAW, and SURFER, as the                  
              most appropriate and cost-effective configuration to achieve                   
              the objective.  After the completion of the project, a                         
              laboratory manual with supporting software will be produced.
