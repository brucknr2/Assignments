Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is designed to engage early childhood teachers                    
              and early childhood staff development efforts of Alaska in                     
              science education.  Content and methodologies of science                       
              education will be taught within the framework of                               
              developmentally appropriate, emergent curriculum for young                     
              children.  The initial staff development activity of the                       
              project is a four week summer institute.  During the                           
              subsequent school year, mentoring, computer networking, and                    
              presentation of district and statewide inservices will                         
              support the summer instruction.  The project will use the                      
              existing organization, instructional strategies, and staff                     
              of the successful Alaska Science Consortium and meld these                     
              with early childhood methodologies, leaders and networks.                      
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because of its systemic plan to enhance the science                    
              teaching of all teachers of elementary science in the                          
              district.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 48% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
