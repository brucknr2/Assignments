Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Pratt Museum, a natural history museum in                             
              Southcentral Alaska, proposes to bring before the public an                    
              exhibition on oil pollution.  Using the historic disaster of                   
              the March 1989 grounding of the Exxon Valdez, the museum                       
              presents a dramatic, grassroots story of the desperate                         
              struggle to protect the environment and preserve traditional                   
              lifestyles.  The exhibit's purpose is to increase public                       
              awareness of national and global issues pertaining to the                      
              development, transportation, and use of petroleum.  The                        
              1,500 square foot presentation shows what an oil spill is                      
              like through photographs, maps, graphics, and three-                           
              dimensional participatory elements.  The exhibit is                            
              scheduled to open at the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural                       
              History in early 1991, beginning a three-year tour of 12                       
              museums that will reach between 1.5 and 2 million viewers.                     
                                                                                             
                   The NSF contribution will support the circulation of                      
              the exhibit and the development of interactive components to                   
              enhance both the permanent and traveling presentations.                        
              Computerized graphic displays and an educational chest of                      
              learning tools will enhance the basic exhibit through multi-                   
              sensory activities designed for hands-on gallery use,                          
              increasing accessibility for children and disabled visitors.                   
                                                                                             
                   This cooperative project invloves private foundations,                    
              individuals, the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish
