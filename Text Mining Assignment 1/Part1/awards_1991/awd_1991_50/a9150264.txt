Abstract    :
                   The proposal requests partial funding for a 4-day                         
              Conference and Exposition on the theme "Microelectronic                        
              System Education".  One of the objectives of the Conference                    
              and Exposition is to stimulate opportunities for leveraging                    
              NSF's investment in education through joint industry/                          
              government support and discounting of hardware and software                    
              products needed for education.  The principal investigator                     
              has a track record in organizing these conferences.
