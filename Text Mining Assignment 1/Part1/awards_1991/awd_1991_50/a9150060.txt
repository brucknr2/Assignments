Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The State of Ohio proposes a Statewide Systemic Initiative to                  
              improve the educational outcomes in mathematics and science by                 
              creating a framework and process for the pre-service education                 
              and sustained professional development of middle school and                    
              junior high school mathematics and science teachers. The                       
              initiative is to be implemented through ten regional centers                   
              which are to be established and staffed by teams which include                 
              scientist/educators and teacher-leaders and which emphasize                    
              inquiry-based instruction.  The centers will utilize research                  
              strategies that assess changes in student learning; perform                    
              additional research to focus on the adaption or creation of new                
              inquiry-based instructional materials; and provide ongoing                     
              support to practicing teachers. Cost Sharing: 300%.
