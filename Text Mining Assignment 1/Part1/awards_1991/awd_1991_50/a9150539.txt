Abstract    :
              A new type of introductory chemistry course will be developed                  
              to serve both as a general education course for non-science                    
              majors and also as a first college course for science majors                   
              and minors.  The philosophical basis for the course would be                   
              quite different from that of traditional General Chemistry.                    
              The emphasis of the new course would be on understanding                       
              synthetic processes whereby molecular-level coherences have                    
              emerged from less-organized antecedents, rather than on the                    
              analysis of substances and reactions into ever smaller                         
              components.  The approach is characteristic of scientists in                   
              the field of nonlinear dynamics, evolutionary systems and self-                
              organization in far-from-equilibrium conditions.The first year                 
              (of three) would involve full-time course development aided in                 
              part by a sabbatical leave.  The second year would involve                     
              offering a two semester course, with laboratory, for twenty-                   
              five students, and continued course development.  The third                    
              year would involve a similar course for a larger group of                      
              students and also a conference to bring the philosophical basis                
              of the course to a large audience of potential users.
