Abstract    :
              An innovative science course for non-science majors will be                    
              developed in a collaborative effort involving Columbia College,                
              Indiana University and Princeton University.  The course will                  
              use topics in environmental science to communicate basic                       
              scientific concepts in a relevant and meaningful way.  For                     
              example, the topic of nuclear power will provide a vehicle for                 
              teaching atomic structure, chemical bonds, radioactivity,                      
              fission and fusion. Environmental issues offer an excellent way                
              to introduce the major scientific disciplines because so many                  
              of them have important physical, geological, chemical and                      
              biological dimensions as well as others involving engineering,                 
              economics, political science and psychology.  The course will                  
              have an interdisciplinary approach; learning will be                           
              facilitated by having the students incorporate the skills of                   
              their major field of study in course projects, such as video                   
              tapes, magazine articles, theater scripts, paintings, posters                  
              and sculptures.  Dissemination will be accomplished with                       
              workshops and video tapes as well as printed material and                      
              meeting presentations.  There is significant institutional                     
              support for this project.
