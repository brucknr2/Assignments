Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Illinois State University will conduct a three-year program                    
              to enhance 56 mathematics teachers of grades 4 through 8.                      
              Each teacher will attend a four-week summer institute and                      
              six half-day academic year seminars each year and will be                      
              given released time to meet with project staff and to mentor                   
              preservice teachers and their peers.   The project                             
              emphasizes "LINCS" between research and instruction,                           
              elementary and high school mathematics, self-improvement in                    
              mathematics instruction and building mathematical                              
              leadership, and inservice and preservice teachers.                             
              Approximately 60 preservice teachers will be mentored by the                   
              participants.  Approximately 100 second-wave teachers will                     
              also be enhanced through the project, and the local school                     
              districts have pledged to support further inservicing of                       
              teachers after the NSF funding terminates.  In all, 60                         
              preservice and 150 inservices teachers will be effected by                     
              this project.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Major mathematical topics include the integration of                           
              technology into mathematics teaching and learning; problem                     
              solving in the content areas; the teaching and learning of                     
              prealgebra/algebra concepts and skills; probability,                           
              statistics and graphing; geometry and measurement; and                         
              developing number sense and proportional reasoning.                            
              Eighteen graduate credits may be earned and applied toward a                   
              Master of Arts degree.  Illinois State University and school                   
              district cost-sharing accounts for 25% of the NSF budget.                      
                                                                                             
              This inservice program which LINCS with a current NSF funded                   
              preservice program could become a model for Teacher                            
              Preparation Centers.
