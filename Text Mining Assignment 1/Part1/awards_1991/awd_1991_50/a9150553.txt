Abstract    :
              Lecture materials and laboratory experiments will be developed                 
              for an issues-directed, "chemistry in context" introductory                    
              course for business students.  This project addresses the                      
              problem of creating literacy in science among business students                
              by introducing chemical principles in the context of student                   
              interests.  The course will address materials science, energy,                 
              waste management, and the chemical industry.  New laboratory                   
              experiments will provide hands-on, realistic experiences                       
              relevant to those that students will encounter as managers and                 
              business leaders.  The project will be evaluated, and the                      
              results will be disseminated through educational and business                  
              forums.
