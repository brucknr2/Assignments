Abstract    :
              This project is planning, designing, and developing an                         
              undergraduate curriculum unit consisting of two new and                        
              innovative courses in global climate change.  The two courses                  
              for the general undergraduate community are a science course                   
              entitled "Oceans, Atmosphere and Global Change" and a social                   
              science course on the role of science in policy and law                        
              entitled "Law, Policy, and the Global Environment".  The                       
              science course has been offered once on an experimental basis                  
              to a limited number of students.  As a result it is being                      
              assessed and evaluated as part of a transformation to a large                  
              course. The social science course is a completely new                          
              development and is offered to students generally following the                 
              science course.
