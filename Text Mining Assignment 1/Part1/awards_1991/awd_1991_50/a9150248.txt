Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal provides a plan for the evaluation and                           
              utilization of a school science improvement system. The                        
              project examines sixty-eight objectives of science                             
              education in the form of a system-wide science needs                           
              assessment process. The SOARS (Science Objectives                              
              Assessment and Restructuring System) begins with an                            
              examination of the sixty-eight science objectives and the                      
              purposes of school science and concludes with an action                        
              plan for improvement of science teaching in rural Idaho.                       
              The plan also provides for the identification of K-12                          
              leadership teams in five rural Idaho school districts of                       
              varying sizes.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 13% of the NSF award.
