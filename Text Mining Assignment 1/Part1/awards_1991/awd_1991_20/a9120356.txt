Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary goal of this proposal is to clarify the factors which              
              lead to variation in litter size and infant survivorship in a                  
              species of new world monkey, Callithrix jacchus.  This species is              
              particularly interesting as it habitually gives birth to twins, but            
              will also produce litters with either one or three offspring.  From            
              a theoretical perspective, the determinants of variation will                  
              provide insight into the opportunity for the operation of evolution            
              through natural selection, as well as the stages in development at             
              which it occurs.  Also, it will be possible to determine the degree            
              to which prenatal growth and number of fetuses effects survivorship            
              in the period after birth.  Through statistical analyses, the                  
              investigators will be able to estimate the genetic component to                
              both litter size and infant survivorship.  The basic data will be              
              gathered through the use of laproscopic examinations to determine              
              the timing of ovulation and ultrasound to determine the number of              
              fetuses and to follow the growth of the litters.
