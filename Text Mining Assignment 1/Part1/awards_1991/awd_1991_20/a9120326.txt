Abstract    :
              Helicon waves are bounded electromagnetic waves in                             
              magnetized plasmas with frequencies between the ion                            
              cyclotron frequency wci and the electron                                       
              gyrofrequency wce which satisfy wci<<w<wce and                                 
              wwce<wpe2.  They are important because they are not                            
              limited by plasma density, and they represent a                                
              relatively inexpensive technology that can be                                  
              employed in a growing list of applications which can                           
              take advantage of high plasma density.  These                                  
              include:  large radii RF ion lasers; plasma processing;                        
              sources of multi-charged ions for accelerators; in                             
              collective plasma accelerators; ion thrusters for                              
              spacecraft; and plasma sources for basic plasma                                
              experiments.  The objective of these studies is the                            
              adaption of helicon sources to the efficient                                   
              production and heating of large steady-state high                              
              density plasmas (with densities of 1013cm-3 - 1014cm-3                         
              and higher), to explore the present applications and                           
              to find new applications.  Studies will include:                               
              control of the radial power deposition profile; the m                          
              = + 1 surface mode which has no density cutoff;                                
              ponderomotive effects on source;                                               
              magnetohydrodynamic stability; the role of neutrals;                           
              and characteristics of pulsed sources.  Experiments                            
              will build on past experience with axisymmetric                                
              mirror plasmas (e.g. ponderomotive force and                                   
              rotating field antennas which allow control of                                 
              azimuthal rf modes).  Theory will extend previous                              
              analytic theory to higher frequencies and take                                 
              advantage of extensive experience with the code                                
              ANTENA to analyze rf field data.
