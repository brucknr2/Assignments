Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a long-term visit by Professor MaryAnn                 
              Jerkofsky, Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Molecular              
              Biology, University of Maine, to Japan for a cooperative research              
              project with Professor Tokuo Sano, Department of Aquatic                       
              Biosciences, Tokyo University of Fisheries.  The researchers plan              
              to undertake a study of herpesvirus and its relation to tumor                  
              cells in fish.  Dr. Sano has isolated two fish herpesviruses and               
              has demonstrated that each produces a tumor when injected into                 
              fish: a basal cell carcinoma for the YTV and a papilloma for CHV.              
              He has not grown the tumors in vitro nor characterized viral gene              
              expression in such cultured cells.  Professor Jerkofsky has prior              
              experience with the growth of viral-induced tumors in vitro and                
              with characterization viral antigens present in such cells.  The               
              research will investigate the two potentially oncogenic                        
              herpesviruses in a system that may allow temperature to regulate               
              virus production and viral gene expression.                                    
                                                                                             
              The research results have the potential to offer new models of                 
              both herpesvirus pathogenesis and oncogenicity which could lead                
              to better biological characterization of the viruses CHV and YTV.              
              The Department of Aquatic Biosciences at Tokyo's University of                 
              Fisheries has many ongoing fish tumor studies underway in its                  
              laboratories.  Professor Sano is a first-rate Japanese fish                    
              pathology scientist.  His experience, coupled with Professor                   
              Jerkofsky's expertise in the area of human herpes virology should              
              provide a fruitful collaboration.  It is expected that this                    
              collaboration will continue even after the formal agreement has                
              terminated.
