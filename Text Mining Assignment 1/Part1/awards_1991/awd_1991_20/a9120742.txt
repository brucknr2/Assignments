Abstract    :
                   This action represents an interagency transfer of funds from              
              the National Science Foundation (NSF) to the National Endowment                
              for the Humanities (NEH). These monies, along with monies from                 
              the NEH, will provide for completion of the project, "Development              
              of a Curriculum Data Base for Undergraduate Education," to be                  
              conducted by the Association of American Colleges (AAC). NEH will              
              let a sole-source contract to AAC to undertake this effort. NEH                
              will also administer the contract for NSF and itself. The project              
              will provide transcript, demographic, and academic information,                
              in the form of an accessible data base for NSF researchers, on                 
              about one million of the nation's undergraduates. NSF's funds are              
              to allow for inclusion of those data which apply to science and                
              engineering (S/E) majors, as well as those students who are not                
              majoring in S/E but take courses in science and engineering.
