Abstract    :
              An investigation of the basic mechanisms of a variety of                       
              fundamental chemical reactions ranging from pericyclic                         
              processes to the reactions of carbenes and singlet oxygen will                 
              be conducted. Experimental results will be obtained and                        
              compared with frontier molecular orbital and ab initio                         
              calculations as appropriate. In the case of pericyclic                         
              reactions, attention will be given to the effect of                            
              substituents. Experimental isotope effects will be compared to                 
              predictions derived from theoretical calculations. Molecular                   
              dynamics of forbidden pericyclic reactions will be investigated                
              by variable transition state theory, and ab initio calculations                
              will be performed to generate potential energy surfaces. An                    
              investigation of the dynamics of carbene and singlet oxygen                    
              reactions will be conducted using statistical mechanics and                    
              transition state theory.

              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Kendall N. Houk at UCLA. The                      
              studies will be directed toward providing a better                             
              understanding of a number of important chemical reactions. A                   
              significant portion of the research project will utilize high                  
              speed computers to predict the reaction pathways with the                      
              prospect of designing efficient catalysts which are capable of                 
              increasing reaction efficiency. Such computer predictions are                  
              important since they reduce substantially the actual laboratory                
              time it takes to develop fast and efficient chemical processes.
