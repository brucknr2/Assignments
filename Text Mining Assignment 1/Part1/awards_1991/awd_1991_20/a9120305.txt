Abstract    :
              The effect of metal ions on the hydrolysis of a series of                      
              carboxyl substituted esters and amides will be studied to allow                
              a chemical assessment of the mechanistic possibilities for the                 
              metalloenzyme carboxypeptidase A.  In this work all of the                     
              currently recognized possibilities will be investigated in                     
              systems of known mechanism so that a quantitative evaluation                   
              may be made of the effects on the rate constants of: (1) the                   
              identity of the metal ion, (2) the strength of binding of the                  
              metal ion to either the carbonyl oxygen or the leaving group,                  
              (3) the pKa of the leaving group, and (4) the steric fit of the                
              carboxyl group to the carbonyl.                                                
              In conjunction with the chemical work a kinetic investigation                  
              of carboxypeptidase A will be carried out employing new types                  
              of substrates with which the leaving group can be varied.  This                
              should permit a clear distinction between nucleophilic and                     
              general base mechanisms involving the carboxyl group of Glu-                   
              270.  Employing these and also more conventional ester and                     
              peptide substrates, conformational effect will be investigated                 
              in temperature-jump, stopped-flow studies and in inhibition                    
              studies. The latter experiments will give information on the                   
              nature and identity of the sites in which esters, peptides, and                
              inhibitors bind.  Thus, this work should lead to an                            
              understanding of the kinetics and mechanism of this important                  
              metalloenzyme.
