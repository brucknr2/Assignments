Abstract    :
              The Guerrero Accelerograph Array consists of                                   
              30 strong motion accelerograph stations in                                     
              Guerrero and neighboring states of Mexico.  It                                 
              was installed under NSF grant CEE-82-19432                                     
              and has continued to be fully operational                                      
              through subsequent support from the National                                   
              Science Foundation, supplemented by support                                    
              from the Instituto de Ingenieria, Universidad                                  
              Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.  The array is                                     
              currently recording accelerograms from 50 to                                   
              80 earthquakes each year, and the resulting                                    
              data set includes records from over 25                                         
              significant earthquakes, with four earthquakes                                 
              having magnitudes 6.9 or greater at close                                      
              range.  Most important, it is located in a                                     
              mature seismic gap where an earthquake with                                    
              magnitude up to 8.2 is considered more likely                                  
              to occur than any at other place in North                                      
              America.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The objectives of the Guerrero array are: (a)                                  
              To obtain high quality accelerograms from                                      
              strong shaking caused by magnitude 7.5 to 8                                    
              earthquakes along the Mexican subduction                                       
              thrust; (b) to distribute these data and to use                                
              them to predict the strong ground motions                                      
              from future earthquakes with sufficient                                        
              precision so as to be useful for engineering                                   
              applications; and (c) in particular, to address                                
              the problem of ground motion on basement                                       
              rock in a subduction zone environment similar                                  
              to that found in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest                                 
              and Puerto Rico.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This action is for continued operation of this                                 
              array; to catalog and distribute any new data                                  
              recorded; to interpret the accelerograms that                                  
              have been recorded; and to use the best                                        
              available methods to attempt to predict the                                    
              nature of the strong ground motions resulting                                  
              from anticipated future subduction-zone                                        
              earthquakes.
