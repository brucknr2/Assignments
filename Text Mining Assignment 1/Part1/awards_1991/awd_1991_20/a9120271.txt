Abstract    :
              This award supports visits over a two year period by Dr. Dale L.               
              Whalen of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County to the                  
              Laboratory of Dr. James M. Coxon, University of Canterbury, in                 
              Christchurch, New Zealand.  The Ministry of Research, Science and              
              Technology is supporting the reciprocal visits by Dr. Coxon to                 
              the U.S.  This collaborative research activity is designed to                  
              investigate Lewis acid-catalyzed rearrangement of substituted                  
              epoxides.  The project will attempt to determine the                           
              rearrangement pathways and the stereoselectivity of hydrogen                   
              migration in epoxides.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Semi-empirical and initial calculations will be performed by both              
              research groups.  Exchange visits are designed to facilitate                   
              formulation of the computational approach to profiling the                     
              rearrangement process.  By combining the talents of these                      
              complementary researchers, Whalen the experimentalist and Coxon                
              the theoretician, a significant contribution in the field of                   
              organic chemical dynamics toward understanding the intermediate                
              states in stereospecific epoxide rearrangements should occur.  At              
              present such rearrangement mechanisms are not well understood.
