Abstract    :
              Dinitrogen reduction is essential for maintenance of the                       
              nitrogen cycle by replenishing ammonia lost through microbial                  
              denitrifiction Nitrogenase is a prototypic example of an enzyme                
              with varied Fe:S chemistry associated with electron transfer                   
              and substrate reduction.  In addition, it is an excellent model                
              of energy transduction with ATP hydrolysis.  The Fe-protein of                 
              nitrogenase is the obligate ATPase dependent electron transfer                 
              agent for substrate reduction.  To study how Fe-protein                        
              functions in this role, the following questions will be                        
              investigated in the next grant period.                                         
                          1.  How is the 4Fe:4S cluster assembled in the FE-                 
              protein and how is the resultant cluster processed to the                      
              active state?                                                                  
                                                                                             
                          2.  Where are the ATP/ADP binding sites in the Fe-                 
              protein? What are the different modes of nucleotide binding and                
              how do they elicit the various structural-conformational                       
              changes in the protein?
