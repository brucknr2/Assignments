Abstract    :
              Although approximation algorithms and on-line algorithms have                  
              each been studied rather extensively, there has been very                      
              little work that examines the approximation and on-line                        
              aspects in tandem.  That is, the design of approximation                       
              algorithms that work in an iterative fashion.  The dual goals                  
              in designing such algorithms are to make the algorithm run                     
              fast, and to produce a good approximation.  This research on                   
              incremental approximations is aimed at examining the tradeoffs                 
              and issues involved, as well as to develop incremental                         
              approximation methods for specific problems in register                        
              allocation, scheduling for packet radio networks, and                          
              bin-packing.
