Abstract    :
                   Microparasites have recently  caused the collapse of                      
              populations of a dominant insect competitor in coldwater streams               
              in Michigan.  This has provided a unique natural experiment to                 
              examine the organization of entire stream communities.  The major              
              objectives of this research are:1) to utilize this natural                     
              experiment as well as manipulative experiments, to assess                      
              mechanisms by which this dominant species affects the structure                
              of trout stream food webs, 2) to determine the extent to which                 
              communities dominated by this species represent stable community               
              configurations; and 3) to study the important processes                        
              regulating the abundances of this dominant consumer.  The PIs                  
              will monitor responses (composition and abundances, biomass, and               
              growth rates) of all trophic levels to the treatments created by               
              the natural experiment.  A powerful feature of the natural                     
              experiment is that essentially identical food web perturbations                
              have been experienced at a series of diverse sites, with a                     
              variety of environmental characteristics (e.g., stream size,                   
              trophic structure, physical/chemical attributes).  Thus, the                   
              results should have considerable general applicability.                        
              Manipulative experiments will be performed to:1) determine the                 
              pathways and strengths by which interactions stemming from the                 
              dominant consumer affect the remainder of the community; and 2)                
              identify the processes regulating the abundances of the dominant               
              consumer.  By utilizing this combination of approaches, this                   
              project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the                      
              mechanisms structuring coldwater stream communities and the                    
              stability of stream communities.  This study will be one of the                
              first to document the role of parasites in the population                      
              dynamics of lotic invertebrates.
