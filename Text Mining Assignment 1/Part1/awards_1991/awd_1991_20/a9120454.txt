Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Chemistry program provides continued support to Dr. Jack R.                    
              Norton of the Chemistry Department, Colorado State University,                 
              for research on the acidity and strength of transition metal                   
              hydride bonds.  Specific projects include identifying the                      
              intermediate in acidification reactions of binuclear complexes;                
              determining the relative hydride donor abilities of various                    
              transition metal hydrides; determining the site of protonation                 
              of dinitrogen and related ligands; and investigating the                       
              mechanism of acid cleavage of alkyl ligands from zirconocene                   
              and of the palladium-catalyzed coupling of aryl iodides with                   
              organotin.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Transition metal hydride complexes are important intermediates                 
              in many catalytic processes, such as the hydrogenation and                     
              polymerization of olefins and hydroformylation reactions.                      
              Although these studies are fundamental, they are expected to                   
              provide information important to understanding catalytic                       
              activity.
