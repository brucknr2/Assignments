Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  This project invoves multidisciplinary (seismic, magneto-                 
              telluric) transects along and across the Sierra Nevada in order to             
              examine the crust and upper mantle beneath these mountains.  The               
              principal investigators resolve the cause of uplift of the Sierra              
              Nevada and its relation to the adjoining Death Valley extensional              
              province and the southern San Joaquin basin.  Currently, two end-              
              member models for uplift of the range have been presented.  These              
              are:  (a) isostatic compensation of a deep crustal root and (b)                
              upwelling of the astenosphere associated with extension to the                 
              east.  These two models have fundamentally different consequences              
              for the dynamic behavior of the continents, particularly in the                
              manner in which crustal sections are either (a) underplated by                 
              materials from the upper mantle or (b) weakened and extruded to                
              fill in extensional voids.  In addition to the uplift and related              
              extension of comparable mountain ranges worldwide, examples of                 
              globally significant features that will be better understood by                
              resolution of the Sierran root question include:  factors                      
              controlling the manner in which sialic basement nappes detach; how             
              collision zones collapse under their own burden; and how intra-                
              continental transform faults partition strain to and beyond the                
              Moho.
