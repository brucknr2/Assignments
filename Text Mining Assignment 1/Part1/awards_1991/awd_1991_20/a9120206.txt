Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting continuation of a research                    
              program by Professor William Reinhardt at the University of                    
              Washington to investigate chaotic Hamiltonian systems, their                   
              phase space structures, and semi-classical quantization.  New                  
              work is concentrating on the properties of water in                            
              inhomogeneous states, the surface melting of polar molecular                   
              solids, and the development of new methods for determination of                
              entropies and free energies of solvated systems from trajectory                
              and Monte Carlo simulation.  In a second part of the research,                 
              a scalable, massively parallel computer is being constructed                   
              from 24 RS/6000 processors to provide computing speeds in the                  
              range of 200-300 Mflops.  The system will be used to explorea                  
              variety of problems in theoretical chemistry and develop                       
              parallel codes and algorithms for their solution.

              In surface melting, there is a very inhomogeneous environment                  
              at the surface boundary layer.  Phase transitions in this                      
              environment are being studied from fundamental quantum and                     
              classical mechanical viewpoints using extensive Monte Carlo                    
              computations.  A parallel processor computer is being                          
              constructed to meet the needs of theoretical chemistry for                     
              higher computing speeds than are available from the present                    
              generation of supercomputers.
