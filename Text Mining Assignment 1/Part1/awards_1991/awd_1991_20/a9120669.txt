Abstract    :
                   The purpose of the research is to develop improved methods                
              for handling liquid metals through the use of electromagnetic                  
              forces.  Specific thrust areas of the research include:  source                
              coil design, including development of the three-dimensional                    
              boundary element inverse problem and forward problem solvers and               
              development of an optimization methodology for choice of specific              
              source configuration; three-dimensional levitation, confinement                
              and shaping, including experimental documentation, through                     
              digital image analysis, of position and shape of liquid metal                  
              interfaces; studies of whole-body, surface-coupled and bulk-                   
              coupled instability mechanisms, and studies of solidification                  
              structures of electromagnetically cast metals, with comparisons                
              to conventionally cast structures.                                             
                   The modeling work centers upon development of self-                       
              consistent numerical tools for the design of source coil                       
              configurations and excitations, based upon desired geometries of               
              levitated liquid metals and criteria which discriminate among                  
              alternative source options.  The experimental work is aimed                    
              toward validation of modeling concepts and results, as well as                 
              investigation of practical electromagnetic configurations for                  
              flow control and shaping. If effective techniques for handling                 
              liquid metals without physical contact can be developed, it could              
              greatly increase the efficiency of the conventional casting                    
              industry.
