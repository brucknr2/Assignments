Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS) at the            
              University of Oklahoma proposes to continue the development of                 
              techniques for the numerical prediction of small-scale weather,                
              especially aimed at substantially increasing the accuracy and                  
              reliability of warnings of hazardous weather associated with                   
              thunderstorms.  The program will focus on: 1) the development and              
              testing of a new, easily modified prediction model aimed at being              
              highly portable among different styles of computer architectures               
              and sophisticated in its physical and numerical formulations; and              
              2) the research and development reqired to assimilate new storm-               
              scale observational data into such a prediction model.  To                     
              complement these goals will be a variety of related studies                    
              designed to provide insight into storm predictability, promote the             
              development of data management and visualization tools, and                    
              evaluate strategies for the use of massively parallel computers in             
              solving complex fluid flow problems.
