Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Among cooperatively-breeding birds and mammals, offspring from                 
              previous broods delay independent breeding, remain with their                  
              parents, and assist in rearing subsequent broods.  One possible                
              explanation for this behavior is the "skills" hypothesis, which                
              argues that young need this period of time to learn the skills                 
              required for successful foraging and nesting.                                  
                                                                                             
              Using a mixture of field experimental and descriptive techniques,              
              Dr. Vehrencamp and her students will investigate the process by                
              which young birds acquire adult foraging skills in the                         
              cooperatively-breeding magpie jay, an intelligent, tropical                    
              species with an extremely broad diet and diverse array of                      
              foraging tactics.  By determining the types of information                     
              transmitted by social learning and the mechanisms that promote                 
              social learning (copying or imitation) in this species, Dr.                    
              Vehrencamp will be better able to assess the relative importance               
              of individual (trial-and-error) learning and social learning of                
              complex behavior in animals.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Ultimately, such research on animals should help to pinpoint the               
              constraints upon the reliance on social learning for the                       
              acquisition of novel behavior and thus why copying and cultural                
              variation are primarily human traits.
