Abstract    :
              This is a three year cooperative research project proposed by Dr.              
              Julius Chang, SUNY at Albany, New York, and Professor Fu-Tien                  
              Jeng, National Taiwan University, supported by the AIT (U.S.) -                
              CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  This study plans to               
              develop a regional model of atmospheric chemistry.  This project               
              is the product of the bilateral meeting on long-term air quality               
              changes and their climatic impact supported by the US-Taiwan                   
              Program.  The topic is of special interest to the U.S. and can                 
              have significant effects on understanding air pollution problems               
              in Taiwan.  The major funding resources for this project are the               
              Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency, the Taiwan National                    
              Science Council has provided the computer time for model                       
              simulation.  This cooperation is expected to improve expertise in              
              atmospheric chemistry in Taiwan, while providing important data                
              to the U.S. from a region with little existing information.
