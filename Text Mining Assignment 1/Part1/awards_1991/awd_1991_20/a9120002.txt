Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Center, in association with the University of Illinois, Purdue            
              University, the University of Michigan, and the National Institute             
              of Standards and Technology, undertakes multidisciplinary                      
              interactive research, as well as broadly based education, outreach,            
              and knowledge transfer activities. The research focuses on                     
              developing a fundamental understanding of cement-based materials               
              and the complex relationships among cement chemistry,                          
              microstructure, processing, micromechanics and engineering                     
              properties, and exploiting knowledge gained to design high                     
              performance cement-based materials with superior properties for use            
              in advanced materials structures and systems. These goals require              
              an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional and well coordinated                 
              research team, with expertise in cement chemistry, fracture                    
              mechanics, surface science, electrical engineering, computer                   
              simulation and modeling, and materials science and engineering. The            
              educational and outreach activities include a pre-college                      
              enrichment program for high school science and math teachers, a                
              five week summer program for high school students, and summer                  
              research experience for undergraduates. Knowledge transfer is                  
              effected through research symposia, international research                     
              personnel exchange and research collaboration, the Industrial                  
              Affiliates Program, active participation in the Illinois Technology            
              Challenge Program, and publications in appropriate technical                   
              journals. This Center is directed by Professor Surendra P. Shah.
