Abstract    :
              This award is for U.S. researchers participation in a comparative              
              multinational study of networking and high performance computing               
              initiatives.  The study is being conducted under the aegis of the              
              Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).                  
              This proposal is to support U.S. researchers in the initial                    
              planning, design and early data collection phase of the project.               
              Project members from Europe and Japan will be supported by their               
              national governments.  This project provides an excellent                      
              opportunity for the U.S. to learn about programs of other nations              
              that relate to our high performance computing and networking                   
              activities.  This knowledge can lead to future cooperation and                 
              also help us in maintaining international competitiveness.
