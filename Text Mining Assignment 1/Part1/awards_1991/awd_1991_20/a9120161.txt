Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Sea anemones are marine invertebrates which belong to the most                 
              primitive group of animals with a nervous system.  By investigating            
              the nervous system of these animals we can learn the nature of                 
              neurotransmitter/humor prototypes and their evolution.  Their                  
              functions can be studied using the new biotechnologies of antibody             
              labelling and immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to                  
              localize sites of synthesis and storage as well as the specific                
              receptors that may exist for them.  The research program will                  
              attempt to localize the novel neuropeptides to specific cell types             
              and the nature of the connectivity and synaptic interactions among             
              the different cells.
