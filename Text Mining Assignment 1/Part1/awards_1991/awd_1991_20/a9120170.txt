Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A study of the superfluid transition of 4He films adsorbed on slip-            
              cast Al2O3 powder will be made, using a torsion oscillator and                 
              acoustic techniques.  The vortex core size will be obtained as a               
              function of temperature, film thickness and 3He concentration.  The            
              dissipation at the transition will be measured over a frequency                
              range from 1 kHz to 30 MHz.  It is also proposed to measure the                
              tortuosity of porous ceramics; and to study the dynamics of the                
              lambda transition using a vortex-ring theory.                                  
                                                                                             
              Measurement of the superfluid density in liquid 4He films on a                 
              porous substrate can furnish new insight into the quantum behavior             
              of condensed matter at very low temperature.
