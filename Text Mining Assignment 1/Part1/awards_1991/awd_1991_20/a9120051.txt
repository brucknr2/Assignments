Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of bioelectrochemistry.  During the              
              tenure of this six-month standard grant, Professor Chambers and                
              his students will employ modified electrode and laser induced                  
              fluorescence spectroelectrochemistry techniques to study the                   
              release into solution of organic ions such as ethidium and the                 
              ensuing interactions of these ions with double stranded DNA                    
              molecules.  The analytical utility of the resulting fluorescent                
              DNA complexes will also be evaluated.

              This research builds upon results obtained under Dr. Chambers'                 
              previous NSF grant, CHE-8718057, to provide sensitive methods for              
              the detection of trace amounts of polynucleotides and to study                 
              their mass transport properties in solution.
