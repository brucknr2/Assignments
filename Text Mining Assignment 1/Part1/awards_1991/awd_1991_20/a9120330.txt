Abstract    :
                Expert systems that perform diagnosis are being used increasingly            
              in medicine, aerospace,  and other high-stakes domains.  Research              
              has recently shown that heuristic schemes widely used in such                  
              systems to encode uncertain knowledge - used in diagnosis and                  
              decision making - can produce faulty reasoning.  Schemes based on              
              probability and decision analysis have been proposed as sounder;               
              however, they have often then been dismissed as intractable. The               
              goal of this research is to develop and evaluate new probabilistic             
              and decision-analytic schemes, that are both sound and tractable.              
              The planned products comprise methods for encoding uncertain                   
              knowledge in probabilistic form; for encoding judgments on values,             
              costs, and preferences; efficient algorithms for probabilistic                 
              inference and decision making; and methods to generate                         
              comprehensible explanations of systems conclusions. These                      
              techniques are demonstrated and evaluated by application to two                
              large knowledge-based systems, including a reformulation of QMR                
              (Quick Medical Reference), a system for diagnosis in internal                  
              medicine; and a system for fault diagnosis and repair of gas                   
              turbines for power generation.  These techniques are expected to               
              lead to diagnostic expert systems that are easier to build and                 
              modify, that are more reliable, and that generate diagnostic test              
              strategies that minimize unnecessary and expensive testing.
