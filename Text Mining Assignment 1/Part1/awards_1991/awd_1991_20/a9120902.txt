Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project explores the interaction of hormones and                 
              the immune response in producing reproductive display behaviors                
              and specialized morphology such as the rooster's bright red comb.              
              Testosterone suppresses the immune response in many kinds of                   
              animals, and Dr. Zuk will examine how the immune system is                     
              affected by both natural and artificially-induced changes in the               
              levels of this important hormone.  After challenging male animals              
              with a parasitic disease, their immune response will be monitored              
              in the context of the degree of development of sexual                          
              characteristics and their effect on females.  The research has                 
              implications for the study of the evolution of reproductive                    
              behavior because it may bring to light a new mechanism for that                
              evolution.
