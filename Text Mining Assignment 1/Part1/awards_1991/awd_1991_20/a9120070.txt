Abstract    :
                   The PI has organized a NATO Advanced Research Workshop on                 
              the Global Methane Cycle to be held at Timberline lodge, Mount                 
              Hood, Oregon, 5 - 11 October 1991.  The workshop goals are (1) to              
              bring together prominent researchers from various disciplines                  
              common to the understanding of the global methane cycle, (2) to                
              put together and document the current understanding of the                     
              atmospheric methane cycle, (3) to chart out promising directions               
              for future research, (4) to produce a definitive book that will                
              reflect the present understanding of the methane cycle and                     
              contribute to the planning of future research (Publisher:                      
              Springer-Verlag, Berlin), and (5) to produce a collection of                   
              research articles that will make available to the scientific                   
              community the best current research on specialized subjects                    
              related to the global methane cycle (Special Issue Chemosphere,                
              Pergamon Press, Oxford, England).
