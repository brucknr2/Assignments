Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Experiments will be conducted aimed at clarifying the                          
              predominant mechanism leading to the generation of streamwise                  
              vortices at the wall in wall-bounded flows. A flush, wall                      
              mounted actuator will introduce distortions into a base                        
              laminar flow, ranging from pure strain to pure vorticity.                      
              Diagnostics will be from LIPA (Laser Induced Photochemical                     
              Anemometry).                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The experiments will quantitatively identify near-wall events                  
              initiating flow distortion, and have strong relevance to                       
              active boundary layer control.
