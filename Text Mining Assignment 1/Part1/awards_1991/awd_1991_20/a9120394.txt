Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for the investigator's                     
              participation in an international conference on                                
              intelligent robots and systems. He is scheduled to present                     
              a paper on "A Goal Seeking and Obstacle Avoiding Algorithm                     
              for Autonomous Mobile Robots."  This topic relates to his                      
              research interests in sensor based navigation, map                             
              building and control systems for these devices.  The                           
              investigator plans to meet with professors at Osaka                            
              University and research institutions in Japan that have                        
              work underway on mobile robots.  These contacts are                            
              expected to assist him in developing his own research                          
              program.  His participation in the workshop and other                          
              contacts in Japan are also expected to assist the                              
              Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in developing a                        
              robotics component to its initiative on research relating                      
              to productive and environmentally acceptable ways of                           
              utilizing coastlines of the United States for waste                            
              management.
