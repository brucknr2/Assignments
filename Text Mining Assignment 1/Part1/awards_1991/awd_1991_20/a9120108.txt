Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of this research is to explore the mechanisms of                       
              strengthening in single-crystal nitride superlattices.  The shape,             
              amplitude, direction, and lattice mismatch of the composition                  
              modulation are variables.  Superlattices are grown by sputter                  
              deposition and characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission             
              electron microscopy, and Auger spectroscopy.  Nanoindentation is               
              used to measure hardness, and models are developed for hardening               
              based on dislocation motion through the layered structures.

              The understanding gained from this research could be used for                  
              controlling process variables to tailor mechanical properties in               
              thin films.
