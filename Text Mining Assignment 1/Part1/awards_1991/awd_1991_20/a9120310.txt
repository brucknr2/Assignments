Abstract    :
              This proposal is concerned with the development of a computer                  
              system for tutoring college-level biology.  While tutoring                     
              systems have been built for biology before, new capabilities:                  
              flexible instruction, model simulation, and visualization, are                 
              proposed.  Flexible instruction will permit dynamic generation of              
              instructional material that is appropriate for each teaching                   
              situation.  Simulations of models of biological systems will                   
              explain and predict such systems' behavior.  Visualization will                
              dynamically illustrate these systems.  Synergistically combining               
              these capabilities, this tutoring system will allow students to                
              ask questions, request clarification or elaboration, and                       
              inquisitively experiment.
