Abstract    :
              This is a feasibility study for developing a new way to stimulate              
              the phrenic nerve at the base of the neck to restore breathing.                
              The stimulation will be delivered through eddy currents induced by             
              a magnetic field switched on and off.  The field is created by                 
              large electric currents in specially designed coils.  Using animal             
              experiments, the project will determine whether the proposed method            
              can deliver pulses of sufficient intensity to maintain continuous              
              breathing.  If successful, the new technique may provide an                    
              effective and noninvasive method to provide artificial ventilation             
              without having to gain access to the airways.
