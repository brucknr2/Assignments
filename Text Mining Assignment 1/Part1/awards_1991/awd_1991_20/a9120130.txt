Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is concerned with fundamental studies of liquid                  
              crystal material confined to small spherical and cylindrical                   
              cavities.  Both experimental and theoretical studies will be                   
              conducted. The ultimate aim is to obtain an understanding of                   
              polymer dispersed liquid crystals used in displays, optical                    
              processor, and electrooptic devices.  Deuterium nuclear magnetic               
              resonance and optical birefringence are used to determine the                  
              nematic structure in cavities (0.01 to 10 micrometer in diameter)              
              and to measure certain surface elastic constants such as the                   
              saddle-bend surface elastic constant for micro-confined systems for            
              the first time.  Also, molecular anchoring strength will be                    
              measured to gain better understanding of the chemical effects on               
              surface anchoring.
