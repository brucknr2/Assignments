Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Science and Technology Center undertakes multidisciplinary,               
              interactive research, as well as broadly based education and                   
              knowledge transfer activities. The research focuses on                         
              understanding the factors and underlying mechanisms that control               
              the properties of high performance polymeric adhesives and                     
              composites, and on exploiting knowledge gained to design innovative            
              advanced materials systems with superior properties. These goals               
              require extensive collaboration and integration of results from a              
              research team with expertise in synthetic polymer chemistry,                   
              surface science, mechanics, chemical engineering, and materials                
              science and engineering. The educational and outreach activities               
              include summer undergraduate research programs, a continuing                   
              education program for college faculty, and a very extensive                    
              continuing education program primarily designed for industrial                 
              researchers. Knowledge transfer is effected through research                   
              symposia, workshops, academic and industrial personnel exchange                
              programs, strong collaborative interactions with personnel in                  
              government laboratories and industry, and publications in                      
              appropriate technical journals. This Center is directed by                     
              Professor James E. McGrath.
