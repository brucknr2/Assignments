Abstract    :
              The award supports two visits by Dr. Philip R. Brooks of Rice                  
              University to the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New                  
              Zealand, to work with Dr. Peter W. Harland on complementary                    
              experiments probing the effects of molecular orientation during                
              collision.  At Rice, collisional ionization (or "electron                      
              transfer collisions") are being studied at energies of a few eV,               
              and the group at Canterbury is initiating studies of electron                  
              bombardment ionization of oriented molecules.  In both these                   
              studies, molecules in molecular beams are state-selected in an                 
              inhomogeneous electric field, and then oriented in a weak uniform              
              electric field.  The orientation can thus be specified (and                    
              changed) to study its effect on various collisional processes.                 
              The need to orient molecules and to guide charged particles into               
              or away from the collisional region is common to both programs.                
              The Rice group has extensive experience in charged particle                    
              optics and mass spectrometry.  This complementary expertise in                 
              ongoing research justifies this cooperative research.
