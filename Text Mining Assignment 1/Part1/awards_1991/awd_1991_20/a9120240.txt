Abstract    :
                   This research team combines theory and experiment to                      
              investigate the fundamental physics of the "non-neutral                        
              plasma", i.e. a plasma consisting entirely of one charge                       
              species.  The investigations will center on electron plasmas                   
              but the governing physics applies to positron or antiproton                    
              plasmas as well.  Of the many unique features of non-neutral                   
              plasmas perhaps the most striking is their behavior when                       
              cooled to very low temperatures.  At cryogenic temperatures                    
              liquid and crystal phase transitions can occur within the                      
              confined plasma body.
