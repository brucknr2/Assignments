Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves graduate students in the ethnographic                    
              research of faculty at the Anthropology department of the                      
              University of Kentucky.  In order to be assured of a cohort                    
              of well-trained future social scientists, the National                         
              Science Foundation is supporting the specialized training of                   
              graduate students relatively early in their graduate                           
              education, before they are fixed upon their dissertation                       
              topics.  This training will increase their ability to carry                    
              out sophisticated dissertation research.
