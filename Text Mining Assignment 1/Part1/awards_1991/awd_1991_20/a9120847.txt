Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              This purpose of this project is to investigate a number of live                
              theoretical issues in the acquisition of language through                      
              detailed experimental studies in Chinese and English.  These                   
              studies will focus on the development of one module of linguistic              
              theory, namely Binding theory.  Throughout the course of this                  
              investigation, the investigators will to chart many important                  
              aspects concerning children's development of knowledge of                      
              Binding.  The Chinese data will be collected in Taiwan and the                 
              English data will be collected in the United States.  Several                  
              topics and theoretical approaches will be considered.  In                      
              particular, the researchers will investigate the following                     
              interrelated topics: 1) The interaction between syntactic and                  
              pragmatic principles on children's acquisition of bound-variable               
              versus referential pronouns.  2) The relationship between Chinese              
              children's apparent lack of long-distance binding and their                    
              acceptance of object antecedents for the reflexive ziji.  3) The               
              possibility of explaining anomalous acquisition phenomena by a                 
              parametrized theory with independent parameters versus a richly                
              interrelated developmental theory.  4) The relationship between                
              children's knowledge of long-distance binding and subject-                     
              orientation and the theory of ziji-movement in Logical Form.  5)               
              Children's knowledge of non-canonical chain-binding and binding                
              of adjuncts.
