Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Professor Lee H. Spangler of Montana State                 
              University will study the effect of the electronic state of a                  
              molecule on interactions between its non-rigid parts.                          
              Specifically, methyl and amine interactions will be examined as                
              a function of distance in molecules with pi-electron systems                   
              using various spectroscopic techniques applied to samples                      
              prepared in a supersonic jet expansion.  An understanding of                   
              the influence of electronic state on conformational changes is                 
              expected to result.                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              The large amplitude, low frequency motions of molecules affect                 
              the conformational preferences and reaction specificity of                     
              those molecules.  For example, knowledge of the conformation of                
              a reagent molecule obtained from the fundamental study of the                  
              structure of a much smaller related species allowed one                        
              researcher to devise a synthetic route for a large class of                    
              polyether antibiotics.  A detailed understanding of what                       
              determines conformational preferences as a function of                         
              molecular environment and electronic state is also key to                      
              understanding biological activity.  The current project aims at                
              gathering conformational information in several types of                       
              molecular systems.
