Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides continued support to the investigation of                     
              ruthenium(IV) oxo chemistry by Dr. Kenneth J. Takeuchi of the                  
              Chemistry Department, State University of New York at Buffalo.                 
              New complexes will be synthesized which utilize tertiary                       
              phosphine ligands, cis-chelating ligands, trans-spanning                       
              ligands, and macrocyclic bis(dioximato) ligands.  A variety of                 
              steric and electronic environments will be created around the                  
              metal by use of these ligands.  The kinetics and mechanism of                  
              the oxidation of alcohol, amine, and sulfide substrates will be                
              studied in detail, for the purpose of monitoring the                           
              sensitivity of the catalyst to these environmental changes.  In                
              addition, ruthenium(II) aquo complexes of these ligands will be                
              prepared and their substitution and aerobic oxidation reactions                
              with alkenes will be investigated.                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Ruthenium(IV)oxo complexes have been found to serve as                         
              effective catalysts for the oxidation of certain organic                       
              compounds.  Previously, Takeuchi has determined the details of                 
              action of some complexes of this type.  Here, the complexes                    
              will be modified and their catalytic activity tested to                        
              determine if the activity of the catalyst can be controlled to                 
              give specific products under predetermined conditions.
