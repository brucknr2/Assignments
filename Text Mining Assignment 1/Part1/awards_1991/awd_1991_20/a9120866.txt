Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Vision in Drosophila (fruit fly) utilizes a fundamental biochemical            
              pathway to convert light into chemical and electrical signals that             
              eventually are processed by the brain.  This type of cellular                  
              signaling is found in both plants and animals an is known to be                
              active in hormonal, sensory, nervous, secretory, developmental                 
              processes in humans.  Several decades ago, a mutation (designated              
              norpA, for "no receptor potential") in the fruit fly was found                 
              which renders the animal blind without effecting eye structure.                
              Within the past few years the norpA gene has been cloned and shown             
              to encode the enzyme phospholipase C, an important factor in the               
              production of a number of intracellular chemical signal agents. The            
              lack of this enzyme renders the fly blind.  In higher animals this             
              gene encodes a number of enzymes and proteins whose function are               
              unknown.  The goals of this proposal are to utilize molecular                  
              genetic methods to study the expression of the norpA gene, identify            
              its products, reintroduce them into the deficient animal to                    
              determine the products function in terms of their importance to the            
              process of visual transduction.
