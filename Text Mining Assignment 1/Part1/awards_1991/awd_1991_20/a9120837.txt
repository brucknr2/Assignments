Abstract    :
              The main objective of this project is to extend the                            
              basic technical concepts behind present short-term                             
              energy management so that they can integrate                                   
              radically different constraints and incorporate                                
              alternative optimization criteria to permit                                    
              quantitative evaluation of the new ways in which                               
              power systems are evolving.  The project seeks to                              
              include generation options available from the                                  
              independent power producers in a security                                      
              constrained dispatch methodology.  The primary                                 
              goal is to develop an optimization approach that                               
              can be performed in real time for operator use.  An                            
              approach which iteratively combines the alternating                            
              consideration of technical and economic criteria is                            
              the main focus of the work.
