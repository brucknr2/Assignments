Abstract    :
              Marywood College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a                  
              56,000 bits per second line through the PREPnet mid-level network.             
              The connection enhances collaborations of campus researchers with              
              colleagues in several fields such as dietetics, psychology,                    
              business and managerial science, social sciences and mathematics,              
              and enables on-line access to remote bibliography databases and                
              supercomputers.  This award funds part of the costs for two years.
