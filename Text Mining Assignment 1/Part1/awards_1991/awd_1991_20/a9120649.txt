Abstract    :
                   This grant will continue to support three professors,                     
              nine graduate students and a junior postdoctoral fellow in                     
              studies of production of particles made up from the                            
              constituents of the strong interaction.  These constituents                    
              are the quarks and gluons, and the former are usually                          
              distinguished as to whether they are "light" (as in the case                   
              of the proton or neutron for instance) or "heavy" as in                        
              particles discovered only within the past decade having a                      
              property called "charm."  Two experiments are to be carried                    
              out.  In the first, E687 at Fermilab, data will already have                   
              been accumulated, and the analysis of the production of                        
              charmed particles will be carried out during the three year                    
              period, and set the agenda for several theses.  In the other                   
              experiment, E852 at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), the                  
              equipment is still under construction.  This experiment                        
              focusses upon study of particles made primarily from light                     
              quarks, and more speculatively upon those made from gluons.
