Abstract    :
                   Bacteria are currently being evaluated as agents of                       
              bioremediation in improving the environment.  If bacteria bearing              
              genes which can detoxify toxic elements in the environment can                 
              survive in contaminated environments, these human hazardous                    
              elements can be eliminated efficiently and economically.  There is             
              considerable concern, however, about the fate of organisms used for            
              the purpose.  This project focuses on identifying genes and their              
              products which are linked to the survival and persistence of                   
              microbial organisms.  The model is soil pseudomonades in a soil                
              environment, since pseudomonades are currently being considered for            
              release in to the environment and because genetics and genetic                 
              techniques are not well established and feasible in this organism.             
              The work aims to identify important traits which can be manipulated            
              (increased, decreased or inactivated) so as to control bacterial               
              survival.  Besides the practical applications of this work, the                
              knowledge of those traits needed for bacterial survival and                    
              persistence will be of tremendous insight to bacterial ecologic                
              systems elsewhere.
