Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              New Zealand's recent movement toward liberalization of all                     
              economic activity provides a unique case study opportunity to                  
              both observe and evaluate the effects of deregulation on the                   
              agricultural section of the New Zealand economy.  This                         
              cooperative research award supports visits over a two year period              
              by Dr. Warren Johnston of the University of California at Davis                
              to work with Dr. Gerald Frengley and colleagues at Lincoln                     
              University in Canterbury, New Zealand.  The research focuses on                
              the impact of deregulation on adjustment of farm firms to changes              
              in input, commodity and capital markets.  Emphasis will be on                  
              changes in financial conditions and differential abilities of                  
              farm firms with respect to survival.  Analysis includes financial              
              and efficiency assessments, and is extended to include                         
              consequences for family farm households incorporating                          
              expectations and financial stress.  The research results should                
              be of interest to agricultural economists, policy makers and to                
              farmers not only in New Zealand but also should have important                 
              implications for agriculture in North American and Eastern and                 
              Western Europe.
