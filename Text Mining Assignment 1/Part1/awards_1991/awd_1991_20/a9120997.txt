Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA receptor) is a protein              
              which helps regulate communications between nerve cells in the                 
              brain and spinal cord by regulating the movement of ions across                
              the nerve cell membranes and controlling excitability of nerve                 
              cells.  To understand how this receptor functions it is essential              
              to know its three-dimensional structure.  This can be determined               
              with the use of the electron microscope to learn the number of                 
              subunits which combine to form the GABA receptor structure and                 
              should give us additional insights into how the GABA receptor is               
              able to regulate neuronal communication.  Also, identifying the                
              sites on the GABA receptor where benzodiazepines and GABA bind,                
              using chemical labeling methods,  will lead to an understanding                
              of the function of the receptor in nervous system function and                 
              behavior.
