Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this proposal is to  determine the differential               
              effects of the evolutionary forces of drift and migration on                   
              patterns of biological variation in Ireland resulting from                     
              demographic shifts following the Great Famine of the 1840s.  This              
              project will provide insight into human evolution and variation                
              from a unique perspective afforded by several generations of                   
              data.  This project will also provide general information on the               
              effects of changes in population size and migration on human                   
              genetic variation.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Physical anthropologists are interested in the relationship of                 
              evolutionary process with cultural and demographic changes.  The               
              Irish Famine of the 1840s resulted in major demographic shifts,                
              including a rapid reduction in population size that persisted                  
              through the early 20th century and an increase in migration                    
              between depopulated regions.  These rapid changes could increase               
              genetic differentiation through drift (random genetic change) or               
              decrease it through migration (gene flow).  The opposing forces                
              of drift and gene flow have been studied in numerous human                     
              populations to date, but almost always at one point in time.                   
              Using extensive physical and demographic data from Ireland                     
              (originally collected in a survey during the 1930s), the PI will               
              be able to examine these changes over at least three generations               
              of people born after the Famine.                                               
                                                                                             
              The results from this study will provide a unique perspective on               
              the process of human microevolution by examining genetic changes               
              over several generations (such data are rare in human studies).
