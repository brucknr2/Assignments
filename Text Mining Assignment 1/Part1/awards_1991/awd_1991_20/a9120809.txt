Abstract    :
              Students of architecture, in collaboration with engineering and                
              other students, at U.S. universities will be invited to enter two              
              competitions, staged serially, to develop conceptual designs for               
              McMurdo Station, Antarctica, and for comparative studies of the                
              two extreme environments of Antarctica and space.  The                         
              competitions are educational--they are intended to develop                     
              capabilities in the design and engineering of structures that                  
              support science and human existence in extreme environments.  The              
              project follows on an earlier "Environment 1" competition managed              
              by AIAS to develop a conceptual design for a research station at               
              the geographic South Pole.  That competition attracted 167                     
              projects from 71 schools.
