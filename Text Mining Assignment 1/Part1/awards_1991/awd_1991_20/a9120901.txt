Abstract    :
              This award will partially support the participants cost of a                   
              workshop in molecular studies in evolution.  The participants                  
              will produce a document that will give definition to the field of              
              evolution on a molecular scale, discuss its importance, and give               
              guidance to NSF on how to anticipate developments in this area in              
              the future.  The workshop has identified four areas of emphasis:               
              molecular systematics, theoretical and computational aspects,                  
              molecular population biology and genetics, genome-molecular                    
              evolution.  The Sloan Foundation has agreed to co-support this                 
              workshop.
