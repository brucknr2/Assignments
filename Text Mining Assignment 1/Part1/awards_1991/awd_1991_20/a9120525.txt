Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on quantum phase                        
              transitions, that is, phemonena in which the ground state of a                 
              many-body system changes qualitatively as some control parameter is            
              varied at zero temperature.  These include transitions from metal              
              to insulator as a function of interaction strength, randomness or              
              both, changes in magnetic order with hole density, representation              
              of the spins, or microscopic couplings, and the transition from                
              metal to superconductor with doping.  All these problems have the              
              common feature that there is generally no obvious small parameter              
              to allow a clean theoretical calculation.  This will be handled in             
              a variety of ways: by working with low dimensional analogs amenable            
              to exact solution, by embedding the given problem in a larger                  
              family (with bigger spin, bigger group, etc.) where a small                    
              parameter exists, and by the application of the renormalization                
              group which permits one to deal with the problem in stages instead             
              of all at once.                                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              This work will utilize techniques developed for high energy physics            
              to investigate phase transitions in condensed matter systems where             
              the properties of matter change from one form to another, such as              
              occurs when an insulating material changes to one which has no                 
              resistance to the flow of electric charge.  Usually these phase                
              transitions are studied as a function of temperature.  However, for            
              this work the calculations will be done at zero temperature where              
              quantum effects dominate.  The effects to be studied are basic to              
              many modern problems in condensed matter physics and materials                 
              science.
