Abstract    :
              The mechanism and consequences of rapid  electron transfer                     
              reactions will be investigated using a picosecond laser flash                  
              photolysis system designed to record the absorption of                         
              transient intermediates on the order of a few picoseconds. The                 
              cycloaddition reactions to be investigated include: (1) the                    
              addition of olefins to stilbene; (2) the Paterno-Buchi reaction                
              between benzophenone and a variety of alkenes and selected                     
              alkynes; and (3) an evaluation of the mechanism for                            
              photoreduction of aryl ketones with metal hydrides. All of the                 
              reactions to be investigated involve cycloaddition reactions                   
              which proceed via short lived intermediates.  In the context of                
              the electron transfer processes which occur in these reactions,                
              the crucial differences between contact and solvent separated                  
              ion-pairs will be clearly delineated for the first time.

              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program to Professor Kevin                
              Peters at the University of Colorado will involve the study of                 
              very fast chemical reactions which are complete in less than a                 
              billionth of a second. Reactions called cycloadditions, which                  
              are promoted by the transfer and redistribution of electrons                   
              from one molecule to another, will be monitored by a laser                     
              system capable of recording the existence of short-lived                       
              intermediate species which only exist for a few trillionths of                 
              a second. The need to understand the properties of these                       
              transient species is critical to defining the role of electron                 
              transfer in a variety of reactions of importance in                            
              biological and technological processes.
