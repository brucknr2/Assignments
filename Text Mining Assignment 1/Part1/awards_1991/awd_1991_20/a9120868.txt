Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  This project will develop a neural network system to                      
              dynamically code facial expression, automating a process which,                
              though widely used, is now highly time, labor, and cost                        
              intensive.  Automation will make this metric accessible to many                
              more researchers at less cost, while eliminating residual                      
              interscorer discrepancies.                                                     
                   Measurement of facial expression is valuable in many                      
              domains, and has led to unique insights in problems as diverse as              
              human development, sociology, developmental and social                         
              psychology.  From a practical standpoint, different aspects of                 
              expression eluicidate whether a listener is empathetic or hostile              
              (important in politics and business), distinguish abusive from                 
              nonabusive caretakers (social work), predict divorce in                        
              dysfunctional married couples, and may incriminate dissembling                 
              witnesses (forensics).  Reliability of facial expression as a                  
              gauge of nervous system function has been affirmed through                     
              autonomic nervous system indices as well as electromyography and               
              electroencephalography.                                                        
                   Initially, automating measurement of facial movement will                 
              involve static images of faces of a single subject, which will be              
              preprocessed to normalize size and brightness, compressed with a               
              back-propagation image compressor, and fed to a second neural                  
              network whose output will correspond to the "action units" of the              
              widely used "Facial Action Coding System."  Recent techniques                  
              such as weight-sharing will be used where necessary.  Recurrent                
              networks will be used to allow processing of dynamical                         
              information, with extension of implementation to multiple                      
              subjects.                                                                      
                   This methodological advance has the potential for a                       
              significant contribution to the infrastructure of science in many              
              domains.
