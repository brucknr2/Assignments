Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Spectral numerical modeling is to be carried out to simulate                   
              magnetohydrodynamic flows of electrically conducting liquid.                   
              The regime to be studied is for intermediate strengh magnetic                  
              fields, neither so strong as to suppress inertia effects nor                   
              so weak as to modify flows only slightly.  The analysis will                   
              be applied to crystal growth configurations with transverse                    
              magnetic fields.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The configurations to be modeled has the potential for                         
              achieving greater uniformity in crystals grown for various                     
              semiconductor applications.  Results will have utility in                      
              defining optimum growth conditions.
