Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this proposal is to study the dietary                 
              choices demonstrated by an ape (the chimpanzee) and several                    
              congeneric species of monkeys in the Kibale Forest of Uganda.                  
              Physical anthropologists have for many years debated the reasons               
              for the grater success of monkeys relative to apes since the                   
              Miocene and the clear diminution in the number of species of ape.              
              Wrangham has hypothesized that the success of the monkeys has been             
              due to their ability to process secondary compounds in vegetation              
              more effectively than apes.  These compounds are a variety of                  
              toxins which limit the food choices of animals unable to detoxify              
              and digest them.  Confirmation of this hypothesis will be advanced             
              by observation of the food choices of the two primates during a                
              synchronous study.                                                             
                                                                                             
              In this study the investigators will observe the food choices of               
              the study species during feeding in order to quantify the dietary              
              intake.  In addition samples of the foods will be gathered for                 
              laboratory analysis.  The data will then be analyzed for food                  
              choices and composition and the used to clarify the habitat                    
              utilization by this ape and the three monkey species.
