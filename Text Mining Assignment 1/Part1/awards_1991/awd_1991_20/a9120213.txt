Abstract    :
                   Professor Jaecks measures the dynamics of three-body                      
              dissociation among heavy charged particles, such as protons and                
              hydrogent negative ions, so as to understand their very long-                  
              range, correlated motion.  The problem of charged three-particle               
              dynamics is unsolved in quantum theory and this experiment will                
              measure the critical parameters necessary to advance our                       
              understanding of this process commonly encountered in atomic and               
              molecular interactions.
