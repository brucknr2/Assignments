Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Professor Robert Field of the Massachusetts                
              Institute of Technology will study the high resolution                         
              electronic spectroscopy of various diatomic metal halides,                     
              hydrides, oxides and dimers in order to test atom-in-molecule                  
              electronic structure models.  These models use atomic data to                  
              interpret, predict, and interrelate diverse properties of                      
              diatomic molecules, affording insight and identifying                          
              relationships between disparate observables.  These models                     
              identify key experiments which can further test them and help                  
              provide insight into understanding more complex molecular                      
              systems.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              In going from atoms to diatomic and larger and heavier                         
              molecules, the electronic spectra become more and more complex.                
              The unravelling of electronic spectra provides information                     
              about the fundamental structure of the atoms and molecules, and                
              therefore it is desirable to understand these spectra in                       
              detail.  The current project will aid in the understanding of                  
              the structure of diatomic molecules and will provide an                        
              excellent framework for understanding more complex molecular                   
              systems.
