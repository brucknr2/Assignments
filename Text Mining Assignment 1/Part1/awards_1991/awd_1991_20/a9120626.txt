Abstract    :
                   This project in mathematical physics concerns quantum                     
              field theory, modern analysis and probability theory.  It                      
              focusses on the analytic methods of constructive field theory                  
              and applications to statistical mechanics, global analysis,                    
              representation theory and properties of operators in infinite                  
              dimensions.                                                                    
                   Quantum field theories are fundamental to the                             
              understanding of basic physical phenomena.  This work deals                    
              with the mathematical foundations of such theories.
