Abstract    :
              This award supports a quantitative biogeographic study of Paleogene            
              paleoceanography of the Southern Ocean based on sediments recovered            
              by Ocean Drilling Projects.  This work will focus on plankton                  
              redistribution patterns as indicators of changing surface water                
              isotherms and circulation patterns.  It is crucial to global                   
              environmental models to understand the Southern Ocean                          
              circulation during a time when it may not have been the generator              
              of abyssal waters.
