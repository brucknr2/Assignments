Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are to understand                                    
              the effects of space charge on the                                             
              resolution of photoelectron microscopes                                        
              operating at high current densities, to                                        
              improve their resolution, and to exploit the                                   
              space charge nonlinearity for pulse                                            
              measurements and other applications.  The                                      
              photoelectron microscope is an instrument                                      
              in which light induces electron emission                                       
              from a sample and the electrons are                                            
              focussed to form a highly magnified image                                      
              of the sample surface.  Its uses are in                                        
              crystal growth, biology, catalysis, and                                        
              microelectronics.  Earlier theoretical and                                     
              experimental studies of space charge                                           
              limited resolution are in poor agreement.                                      
              Illuminators now used are almost entirely                                      
              incoherent sources rather than lasers                                          
              because of performance difficulties                                            
              encountered with the latter.  In this project                                  
              a spherical-potential electron optical                                         
              system will be used with various types of                                      
              laser illumination to evaluate resolution as                                   
              a function of emission current density.  The                                   
              theory of space charge aberrations will be                                     
              extended to this case and compared with                                        
              experimental results.  Space charge effects                                    
              provide an adjustable, very fast nonlinearity                                  
              which may be used for pulse duration                                           
              measurements and other signal processing                                       
              applications.
