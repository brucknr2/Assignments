Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide supplementary support                                  
              to enable Dr. Prasad Akella of Stanford                                        
              University to conduct collaborative research                                   
              with Dr. Kazuo Tanie for 22 months at the                                      
              Mechanical Engineering Laboratory (MEL) in                                     
              Japan.  Akella and Tanie will apply Dr.                                        
              Akella's behavior models for soft fingertips in                                
              order to better manipulate a three fingered                                    
              robotic hand which was developed by Tanie.                                     
                                                                                             
              Controlling the contact forces of a robotic                                    
              hand when it is tasked to grasp an object is                                   
              quite difficult.  Akella has found that soft                                   
              fingertips stabilize a robotic hand by                                         
              dissipating energy and improve its dynamic                                     
              performance.  In order to overcome the unstable                                
              contact forces of Tanie's robotic hand, the                                    
              team will develop force control software to                                    
              complement Akella's mechanical design solution                                 
              of soft fingertips.  Developing such an                                        
              effective methodology for implementing force                                   
              control in manipulators can lead to more                                       
              advanced robots which could be used for more                                   
              complex tasks in industrial as well as remote                                  
              settings such as undersea or in space.
