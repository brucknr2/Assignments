Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplementary support                                  
              to enable Dr. Inyoung Song of the New Mexico                                   
              Institute of Mining and Technology to conduct                                  
              collaborative research with Dr. Masatake                                       
              Yoshida for 10 months at the National Chemical                                 
              Laboratory for Industry in Japan.  They will                                   
              apply Dr. Song's expertise in shock-induced                                    
              chemical reactions of Ni-Al to conduct research                                
              on shock-induced chemical reactions of the                                     
              reactive metallic and inorganic powder system                                  
              of Nb-Si.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The high pressures and temperatures associated                                 
              with shock-induced reactions of porous reactive                                
              materials give rise to the creation of new                                     
              materials despite a duration of only a few                                     
              microseconds.  The resulting extensive plastic                                 
              deformation, turbulent flow, mechanical mixing,                                
              and surface cleansing yield nano-crystalline                                   
              new materials such as carbynes, C3N4.  Song and                                
              Yoshida will utilize different methods of                                      
              spectroscopy to study and model the shock-                                     
              induced chemical reactions of the reactive                                     
              powder Nb-Si system and their research will                                    
              perhaps lead to a method of synthesis of new                                   
              materials such as C3N4 and BO6 which are as hard                               
              as diamonds.
