Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The formation of specific, functional interactions between neurons             
              is critical to the development of the nervous system.  The precise             
              quidance of axons to target cells is thought to result from a                  
              combination of stimulatory and inhibitory signals.  Barrier or                 
              boundary structures are hypothesized to function by inhibiting the             
              growth of embryonic axons into inappropriate environments.  Two                
              proteins, EAP-300 and claustrin,  have been identified in the                  
              embryonic chick nervous system and shown to be expressed in barrier            
              structures.  The cellular expression and biochemistry of these two             
              proteins will be studied in detail.  In addition, functional in                
              vitro assays will be performed to determine whether these proteins             
              negatively regulate axonal growth and interact to mediate the                  
              function of barrier structures.  These studies pertain to                      
              understanding basic mechanisms involved in the development of                  
              neuronal specificity and the possibility that barrier-associated               
              molecules impede successful nerve regeneration in the mammal.
