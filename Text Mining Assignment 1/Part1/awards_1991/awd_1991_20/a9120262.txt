Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new neurophysiological method for studying signal processing in              
              the hearing or auditory system has been developed for recording                
              the electrical responses of the auditory nerve when sounds are                 
              presented.  This electrical response is called the "peristimulus               
              compound action potential", or PCAP. The PCAP is being used to                 
              investigate the neural basis of the phenomenon known as "forward               
              masking". Forward masking is the reduction in the ability to hear              
              one sound as the result of an immediately preceding sound.                     
              Forward masking plays an important role in speech communication                
              and is also used in a large number of procedures that assess                   
              hearing performance.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The results of these studies will contribute to a better                       
              understanding of the function of the auditory portion of the                   
              nervous system.  In addition, because some of these electrical                 
              responses can be recorded in a noninvasive way from the ear canal              
              of humans, it will be possible to expand these studies from                    
              laboratory animals to humans.
