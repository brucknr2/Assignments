Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a three year laboratory project on the                     
              sputtering of ices in the outer solar system and the interstellar              
              medium.  Sputtering may be produced by magnetnospheric and solar               
              wind plasmas, shock-produced plasmas, and, also by ultraviolet                 
              photon bombardment of icy rings particles, grains, or natural                  
              satellite surfaces.  In this program the group will study photo-               
              desorption of a few of the ices for which only electronic-                     
              stimulated sputtering by fast ions and electrons had been examined             
              in order to test estimates of photo-sputtering yields.  This work              
              will proceed in parallel with plasma-ion sputtering experiments.               
              In this project emphasis will be on certain ice mixtures of                    
              interest in the outer solar system and measurements of the vapor               
              pressure of (sublimation flux from) the plasma-ion-irradiated                  
              surfaces.
