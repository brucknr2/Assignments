Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A central issue in developmental neuroscience concerns the                     
              mechanisms underlying the development of specific connections                  
              between two nerve cells.  Fundamental to the formation of these                
              connections is the guidance of axons along specific pathways to                
              reach their target cells.  In the sympathetic nervous system,                  
              preganglionic nerve cells send information from the brain and                  
              spinal cord to cells located in sympathetic ganglia.  The ganglia              
              relay this information to the heart, blood vessels, and glands.                
              The way in which preganglionic nerve cells are able to find the                
              ganglion during development will be investigated.  The path will be            
              identified by marking nerve cells in the rat and chicken embryo                
              with a dye that permits the visualization of the earliest fibers               
              growing out from these nerve cells.  The time and way in which the             
              specific projection pathways are chosen by preganglionic neurons               
              will be described.  These studies promise to provide a basis for               
              future investigations into the mechanisms involved in directing the            
              guidance of axons in the mammalian sympathetic nervous system.
