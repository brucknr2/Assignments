Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting work by Professor Taylor on                   
              the chaotic behavior of the energy levels of molecules in                      
              highly excited vibrational states and in intermediate resonant                 
              transition state complexes.  Such energy levels are governed by                
              local dynamic adiabatic potentials whose existence is not                      
              evident in the static molecular potentials and hypersurfaces.                  
              These potentials and motions are related to phase space                        
              structures as periodic orbits and reduced dimension tori.                      
              Professor Taylor is using a classical method of analysis which                 
              yields approximations to the desired dynamic potentials and to                 
              the motions.  The research is intended to demonstrate that the                 
              method is capable of providing a physical interpretation of                    
              experimental and computational studies on intramolecular                       
              vibrational relaxation and on the spectra of larger molecules.                 
              %%%                                                                            
              When molecules are highly excited by absorption of electro-                    
              magnetic energy or by chemical reaction, they populate very                    
              complex vibrational energy states that are not predictable by                  
              the patterns found for their lower energy vibrational states.                  
              Experimental and computational methods can provide data, but                   
              Professor Taylor is seeking a relatively simple, classical                     
              method of analysis of the results that will yield qualitative                  
              insight into the dynamics of the systems.
