Abstract    :
              This grant supports studies of the low latitude and equatorial                 
              ionosphere and thermosphere.  The main objectives are the                      
              understanding of the coupling of low latitude electrodynamic                   
              drifts of high latitude current systems and  low latitude                      
              thermospheric neutral winds.  These studies rely mostly on                     
              equatorial and low latitude incoherent scatter radar and Fabry-                
              Perot observations.  Ionospheric and protonospheric studies at                 
              the Arecibo Observatory will be expanded, and through extensive                
              collaborative efforts the use of local and global thermospheric,               
              ionospheric and convection models will be greatly extended.  The               
              main areas of proposed work are: (1) processes controlling the                 
              penetration of high latitude electric fields to low and                        
              equatorial latitudes, (2) comparative studies of ionospheric                   
              disturbance electric fields using radar observations and results               
              from global convection models, (3) coupling of low latitude and                
              equatorial plasma drifts and neutral winds, (4) day-to-day                     
              variability and the effects of the two-day oscillation in the                  
              equatorial thermosphere and on the equatorial ionization                       
              anomaly, (5) high temporal resolution plasma drift measurements                
              over Arecibo, (6) composition of the low latitude topside                      
              ionosphere and protonosphere, and (7) empirical modeling of the                
              ionospheric electric fields at middle and low latitudes.
