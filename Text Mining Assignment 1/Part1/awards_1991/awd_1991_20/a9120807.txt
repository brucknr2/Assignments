Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The effect of the acoustic waves on the atomization of a                       
              slurry jet by high velocity air will be investigated.  The                     
              atomized drop sizes will be measured with a high speed camera                  
              at different resonant acoustic wavelengths, where the theory                   
              indicates a finer and more uniform atomization.  Semi-                         
              empirical models will be used to correlate and interpret the                   
              measurements with Newtonian and pseudoplastic suspensions.                     
              The goal is the controlled generation of micron and sub-micron                 
                                                                                             
              droplets, with narrow size distribution.                                       
                                                                                             
              The research is relevant to powder production, spray coating,                  
              coal slurry combustion, and the use of piezoelectric                           
              materials.  The research project will involve several                          
              undergraduate and graduate students in this predominantly                      
              undergraduate institution (RUI proposal), where more than half                 
                                                                                             
              of students are minorities.
