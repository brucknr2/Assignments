Abstract    :
              The National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in                 
              Engineering, Inc. (GEM) is funding its second teleconference.  The             
              overall goal of this national teleconference is to inform                      
              undergraduate students and employees without advanced training in              
              science and engineering fields of the difference between                       
              undergraduate education and graduate level training and                        
              responsibilities.  In addition, this teleconference will focus on              
              the process of selecting the graduate school best suited to one's              
              particular needs.  This information will be prepared and presented             
              with a multi-ethnic and multi-racial viewing audience in mind.
