Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              The project involves the continuation of work already in progress              
              on producing a basic description of the Kutenai language, an                   
              American Indian language of the Pacific Northwest which is not                 
              closely related to any other language.  The basic goal is to                   
              produce two volumes, one a coleection of texts in the language,                
              the other an analytic dictionary.  Lawrence Morgan recently                    
              completed a dissertation that provides a grammatical description               
              of the language.  The two volumes proposed, together with                      
              Morgan's dissertation, will provide a well-rounded description of              
              the language.  The dissertation is primarily descriptive and                   
              makes the facts of Kutenai grammar available to linguists of all               
              theoretical persuasions.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The project will involve transcribing a number of the texts that               
              already exist on tape, entering them onto computer, and analyzing              
              them.  There are also some existing texts that have only been                  
              transcribed, and others that have been transcribed and entered                 
              onto computer but which need to be analyzed.  The dictionary will              
              serve as a glossary for the volume of texts and for the                        
              dissertation.  Field work will be undertaken and the project will              
              interface with local community-based language projects.
