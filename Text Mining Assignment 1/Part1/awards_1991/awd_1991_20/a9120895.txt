Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research project is to develop new theories                
              and techniques which can lead to computer vision systems having                
              the capability for "generic object recognition" (that is,                      
              identification of objects at the category level).  This                        
              capability is a fundamental part of the long-term research goal                
              of visual perception for an autonomous real-world systems.  The                
              approach to generic recognition that is being pursed in this                   
              proposal is termed form and function.  The basis of the approach               
              is that concepts of object categories are naturally formed in                  
              terms of object function, and that reasoning about object "form"               
              (3D shape) can be used to determine the possible "function" of                 
              the object.  A recognition system has been implemented which                   
              successfully demonstrates this approach for polyhedral shape                   
              descriptions and the object category chair.  This initial success              
              demonstrates that the basic approach is valid and worth continued              
              exploration.  This project will result in extensions of the                    
              theory in the areas of (1) incorporating multiple distinct super-              
              ordinate object categories, (2) function-based modeling of object              
              categories which include articulated objects, and (3) analysis of              
              shape descriptions acquired from real data.
