Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Diverse manifestations of violent activity in the nuclei of                    
              galaxies are believed to result from the interactions of matter                
              with a supermassive black hole.  However, the details of these                 
              interactions and their observational signatures are not well                   
              understood.  This award will support theoretical research studying             
              three important classes of phenomena in active galactic nuclei                 
              (AGNs):  the formation of relativistic jets, the production of                 
              X-ray spectra, and interactions involving ultrarelativistic                    
              particles.  The investigations described in this proposal will                 
              address the questions:                                                         
                                                                                             
              Why do some AGNs produce powerful jets while others do not?                    
                                                                                             
              What can X-ray observations tell us about the temperatures,                    
              densities, and spatial organization of matter close to the black               
              hole?                                                                          
                                                                                             
              What roles (if any) do ultrarelativistic particles play in shaping             
              the energy output of an AGN, and how does this energy affect the               
              environment of the AGN?                                                        
                                                                                             
              The long-term goals of this research are: 1) to determine whether              
              the interactions of matter with a supermassive black hole really               
              are responsible for AGN phenomena; 2) to understand in detail how              
              these interactions take place: and 3) to learn what effects nuclear            
              activity can have on the appearance and evolution of the host                  
              galaxy.
