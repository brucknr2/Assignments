Abstract    :
                   Research centers on bound states in QED and QCD through                   
              the study of spectra, decays and production.  Major effort                     
              will be on the Lamb shift in hydrogen with the goal of                         
              extracting the .2(Z.)5m contribution thus completing the                       
              calculation to about 1 kHz accuracy.  Work will also be                        
              initiated on heavy quark/anti-quark systems including                          
              relativistic and coupled channel effects.  Leptonic widths and                 
              production processes for charmonium will be calculated and                     
              finally, QCD corrections to the production of  states                         
              examined.
