Abstract    :
                   The Principal Investigator, together with senior researcher               
              A. Edelman, plan to apply geometric techniques of singularity                  
              theory to analyze and explain the behavior of certain numerical                
              algorithms widely used in eigensystem analysis and systems and                 
              control.  These algorithms include such apparently diverse                     
              applications as computing the Jordan canonical form of a matrix,               
              determining the distance from a control system to the nearest                  
              uncontrollable system, and "clustering" the zeros of a                         
              polynomial.  Although there are algorithms for these problems                  
              that often work in practice, there are certain classes of                      
              problems for which  they perform quite poorly.  These algorithms               
              have been widely studied and their failures duly noted, but no                 
              unifying explanation of their behavior has yet emerged.                        
                   Numerical Linear Algebra is an area of importance in its own              
              right and has major implications in many areas of computing.
