Abstract    :
              This project will exploit recent theoretical findings by the coPI,             
              Francos, which lead to an improved estimation procedure for the                
              spectral distribution function of a 2-D homogeneous random field               
              (which can also be referred to as a problem in estimating a 2-D                
              mixed spectrum). By imposing a total order on the discrete                     
              (regular) random field and using a new 2-D Wold-like decomposition             
              for homogeneous random fields, the original random field can be                
              decomposed into a purely-deterministic component, modelled as a sum            
              of 2-D harmonic components with random amplitude and phase, a                  
              generalized evanescent component which is characterized by its                 
              spectral distribution attributes, and a purely-indeterministic                 
              component which is modelled by a 2-D AR process.                               
                                                                                             
              The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a combined                  
              detection/estimation procedure for detecting the presence of the               
              deterministic components - the purely-deterministic and generalized            
              evanescent components, and for estimating the necessary parameters             
              of the components which are deemed present in the original                     
              decomposition.
