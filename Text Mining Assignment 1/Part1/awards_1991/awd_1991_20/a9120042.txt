Abstract    :
                   The greatest challenge facing theoretical physicists                      
              today is to construct a consistent and useful quantum theory                   
              of gravity.  Only when such a theory is available can one                      
              begin to determine, with confidence, the nature of the cosmos                  
              in its earliest moments, when it was less than 10_43 seconds                   
              old.  The reason these moments are important is that the                       
              violent fluctuations in the geometry of spacetime that were                    
              then taking place must have had a strong influence on all the                  
              other violent processes that were going on simultaneously (the                 
              Big Bang) and hence on the subsequent evolution of the                         
              Universe.                                                                      
                   Preliminary computer investigations have already been                     
              carried out on a simplified model (known as the O(1,2) sigma                   
              model) that shares some of the significant features of quantum                 
              gravity.  These investigations will be completed and work will                 
              be begun on the quantized gravitational field itself.
