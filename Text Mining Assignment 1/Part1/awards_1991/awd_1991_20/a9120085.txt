Abstract    :
              This grant is intended to study the basic                                      
              nonlinear physics of pure electron plasmas                                     
              in crossed-field amplifiers (CFAs) and in                                      
              Micro-Field Emitter Arrays (MFEAs).  The                                       
              study includes in situ measurements in the                                     
              interaction region of a low frequency (100-                                    
              200 MHz) CFA which has been designed                                           
              specifically for making such measurements.                                     
              These include three-dimensional                                                
              measurements of the electron density, rf                                       
              field, plasma potential, electron energy                                       
              distribution functions, and noise                                              
              mechanisms using a variety of standard                                         
              and newly developed diagnostic probes.                                         
              The study of MFEAs concerns the emission                                       
              from vacuum field-emitters which will have                                     
              many innovative applications in electron                                       
              devices such as the CFA.  This emerging                                        
              technology also requires a study of the                                        
              electron beam dynamics in a very small                                         
              scale which represents a new area of                                           
              plasma research.  New miniature                                                
              diagnostics will be developed for these                                        
              studies.  For the proposed three year                                          
              program, both the macro and micro                                              
              aspects of pure electron plasmas using the                                     
              existing CFA and MFEAs as our                                                  
              experimental vehicles will be studied.                                         
              MFEAs will be further used in the CFA as a                                     
              cathode and as a controllable distributed                                      
              emitting-sole in order to evaluate their                                       
              effectiveness and to study their effects on                                    
              CFA physics.
