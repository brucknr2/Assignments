Abstract    :
              This project is a renewal of research conducted under NSF                      
              Grant No. 89-13065, the objective of which was to develop                      
              and evaluate reliable methods for concentration and assay                      
              of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in wastewater.                       
              Results of work conducted under that award have led to                         
              formulation of the following objectives for the renewal                        
              period:  Determination of the survival of cell-associated                      
              HIV in wastewater after various stages of its treatment,                       
              improvement of concentration and assay procedures,                             
              development and evaluation of a device or procedure for                        
              concentration of the HIV in wastewater and field studies                       
              to isolate indigenous HIV in raw and treated wastewater.                       
                                                                                             
              The survival characteristics of the HIV under                                  
              environmental stresses have not been well-established.                         
              While there is no present indication that the                                  
              environmental media have any role in spreading the virus                       
              from infected to non-infected individuals, the virus has                       
              been shown to survive for significant periods of time in                       
              the environment.  The results of this research are                             
              expected to provide the basis for any changes, if any are                      
              found to be needed, in the engineering design of                               
              collection systems, treatment processes and systems for                        
              management of wastes that are infected with the HIV to be                      
              responsive to its survival and potential infectivity.
