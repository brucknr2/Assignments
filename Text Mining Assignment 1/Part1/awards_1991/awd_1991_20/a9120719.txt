Abstract    :
              The objective of this theoretical research on growth kinetics is to            
              extend our understanding of the generic features associated with               
              the growth of large ordered structures after a deep temperature                
              quench from a disordered state.  In this growth process, patterns              
              evolve which can be characterized by certain universal features.               
              Previous models showed how one could understand these universal                
              features for simple models applicable to magnets and alloys.  New              
              work will be done to understand more realistic and complex unstable            
              systems.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The evolution of a disordered system to an ordered state due to a              
              rapid drop in temperature is a complex problem which is common to              
              many condensed matter and materials systems including phase                    
              separation in polymers and spinodal decomposition in alloys.  This             
              research will develop new analytic models for growth kinetics which            
              will be checked against numerical simulations and experiment.
