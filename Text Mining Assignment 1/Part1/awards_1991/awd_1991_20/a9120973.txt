                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This research is concerned with the processes by which one                     
              individual's preconceived beliefs and expectations about another               
              person influence the dynamics and outcomes of social interaction               
              between them.  Considerable evidence suggests an individual (the               
              perceiver) who holds preconceived beliefs and expectations about               
              another person (the target) will act on these beliefs in ways                  
              that cause the behavior of the target to confirm the perceiver's               
              initial beliefs.                                                               
                                                                                             
              To address the motivational foundations of such behavioral                     
              confirmation phenomena, a functional analysis is offered.  This                
              analysis suggests that interactions sharing the same surface                   
              features (i.e., perceivers acting in ways that induce targets to               
              provide actual behavioral confirmation) may be serving different               
              underlying psychological functions for perceivers and targets.                 
              Particular attention will be directed to motivational functions                
              associated with the acquisition of social knowledge, the                       
              facilitation of social interaction, the expression of personal                 
              attributes, and the defense of threatened identities.  A series                
              of converging empirical investigations will test hypotheses about              
              when and why social interaction will culminate either in                       
              behavioral confirmation or in behavioral disconfirmation.                      
                                                                                             
              Theoretical and practical implications of this research program                
              will be explored, not only for the nature of behavioral                        
              confirmation, but also for understanding the dynamic interplay of              
              cognitive, motivational, and behavioral processes in ongoing                   
              social interaction and interpersonal relationships.
