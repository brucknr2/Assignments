Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The ability to learn new spatial information about the visual                  
              environment involves specific brain regions.  One important area               
              is the hippocampus which in turn receives sensory input from cells             
              of the lateral dorsal thalamic nucleus (LDN).  The focus of this               
              award to Dr. Sheri Mizumori is to study the functional contribution            
              of the lateral dorsal thalamus to spatial information processing.              
              Activity in cells of the LDN will be of these cells is increased               
              when the head is aligned along particular directions in horizontal             
              space, independent of location in the environment.  The visual                 
              properties of the head direction cells will be studied in several              
              ways.  Whether or not manipulation of the visual environment can               
              change the activity of these cells will be tested.  The experience-            
              dependent nature of LDN head direction cells will be evaluated by              
              examining the accuracy during acquisition of a maze task.  The                 
              hypothesis will be tested that visual integration in the LDN is                
              accomplished by subdivisions of the hippocampal formation.  The                
              effect of destroying the LDN on spatial and non-spatial learning               
              will also be investigated.  The results of this research will                  
              contribute to basic knowledge about the dynamics and organization              
              of visual spatial processing.
