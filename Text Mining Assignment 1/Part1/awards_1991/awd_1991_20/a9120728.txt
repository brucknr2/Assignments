Abstract    :
                   This grant to the University of Iowa supports the                         
              research of Professor Edwin Norbeck in the study of                            
              intermediate mass fragmentation resulting from the collisions                  
              of high-energy heavy-ion projectiles with massive targets.                     
              The grant also supports the development of a specialized                       
              forward angle detector array to be used in conjunction with                    
              4Pi detector array at the National Superconducting Cyclotron                   
              Laboratory at Michigan State University.  This detector will                   
              be vital to the fragmentation research and for other                           
              experiments as well.
