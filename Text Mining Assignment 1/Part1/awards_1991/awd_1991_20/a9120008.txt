Abstract    :
                Rice University, in collaboration with the California Institute of           
              Technology, Syracuse University, the University of Tennessee, Argonne          
              National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory, has proposed           
              renewal of the Center for Research on Parallel Computation.  The               
              Director of the Center is Ken Kennedy.                                         
                The goal of the Center is to make parallel computing systems truly           
              usable.  As high performance computing systems become progressively            
              more parallel in their logical organization, ease of use comparable to         
              conventional supercomputers becomes essential to high performance              
              computing.                                                                     
                The objectives of the Center cover a broad range of issues.  The             
              participants will develop theory and algorithms that will be needed to         
              parallelize important scientific applications.  They will imbed these          
              algorithms in scalable libraries that can be implemented on different          
              parallel computer architectures.  They will demonstrate the utility of         
              these software systems, algorithms and libraries in real science and           
              engineering applications.  They will also transfer the knowledge and           
              other byproducts of this research to the science and engineering               
              community and to industry.
