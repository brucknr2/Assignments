Abstract    :
              All three major projects in this proposal, although fundamentally              
              different, require the use of a basic biochemical technique-                   
              following metabolic function with radioisotopes.  One of the                   
              proposals is designed to utilize experiments to study the                      
              regulation of fatty acid synthase gene expression by thyroid                   
              hormone.  Results obtained may possible allow us to correlate the              
              appearance of disappearance of certain phosphoproteins with the                
              transcriptional regulation of this gene by thyroid hormone.                    
              Another one of the projects proposed also investigates the                     
              regulation of gene transcription but does so by trying to                      
              determine the role of methylated DNA.  The third project is                    
              focused on understanding the regulation of the synthesis of                    
              lipids in rat hepatocytes.  The forth project is designed to                   
              examine the effects of various conditions on the cAMP levels on                
              isolated arterioles.  In all projects proposed, radioisotopes are              
              use in a monitoring or detection manner and thus quantitation of               
              these measurements by liquid scintillation counting is essential.
