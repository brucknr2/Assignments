Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.- Poland cooperative research project is                              
              between Dr. James R. Anderson of the University                                
              of Maryland, College Park, and Prof. Robert R.                                 
              Galazka and Dr. Andrzej Mycielski of the                                       
              Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences.                              
              The researchers will investigate magnetism and                                 
              magnetotransport in some of the new types of                                   
              diluted magnetic semiconductors.  They will                                    
              investigate the narrow-gap materials, Hg1-x-                                   
              yMnxCdyTe and A1-xRxB (where A belongs to group                                
              IV of the Periodic Table of the Elements, B                                    
              belongs to group VI, and R is a rare earth), and                               
              the wide-gap systems, C1-xMxD (where C is either                               
              Cd or Zn, M is a magnetic ion such as Co, Fe, or                               
              a rare earth, and D belongs to group VI of the                                 
              Periodic Table).  These materials will be                                      
              prepared primarily by the modified Bridgman                                    
              technique.  Magnetization measurements will be                                 
              used to examine the antiferromagnetic exchange                                 
              interactions among magnetic ions and to look for                               
              spin-glass and ferromagnetic behavior.  When                                   
              combined with magnetooptical studies, the                                      
              magnetization measurements will be used to                                     
              determine the interactions between the magnetic                                
              ions and the carriers.  Magnetotransport                                       
              measurements will be used to investigate carrier                               
              scattering in diluted magnetic semiconductor                                   
              systems.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This project in physics fulfills the program                                   
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                                 
              enabling leading experts in the United States and                              
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents                                
              and pool resources in areas of strong mutual                                   
              interest and competence.
