Abstract    :
              Hood College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000               
              bits per second line through the SURANET mid-level network.  The               
              connection enhances collaborations of campus scientists with                   
              colleagues in fields including biology, chemistry, physics and                 
              astronomy.  This award funds part of the costs for two years.
