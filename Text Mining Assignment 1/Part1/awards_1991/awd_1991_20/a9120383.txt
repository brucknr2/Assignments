Abstract    :
                   Understanding the dynamics of continental extension requires              
              a three-dimensional perspective of the timing, magnitude, and rate             
              of extension over broad regions, however many studies have assumed             
              plane strain and considered processes of extension in only two                 
              dimensions.  This project will examine across-strike and along-                
              strike variations in the amount of extension, relations between                
              extension and magmatism and features adjacent to accommodation                 
              zones by study of Miocene growth-fault basins in the northern                  
              Colorado River extensional corridor.  These data are expected to               
              be useful in development of three-dimensional models for                       
              continental extension.
