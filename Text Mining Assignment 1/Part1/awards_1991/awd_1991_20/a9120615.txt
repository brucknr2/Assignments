                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              The syntax of a very large number of Romance languages from                    
              France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland will be studied with the                
              aim of elucidating the primitives of syntactic variation.  Data                
              will be accumulated from written sources and from native speaker               
              judgments, and an attempt made to bring to light significant                   
              clusterings of syntactic properties.  It is expected that                      
              comparison of a great many very closely related languages should               
              facilitate the discovery of syntactic parameters, and                          
              simultaneously provide unique evidence bearing on the universal                
              syntactic principles postulated to interact with such parameters.              
              The areas of syntax to be emphasized will include: clitics,                    
              infinitives, participles, complementizers, reflexives,                         
              imperatives, quantifiers, adverbs, agreement, causatives, control              
              and auxiliaries.  The hypothesis that syntact variation can be                 
              reduced to a relatively small number of parameters will be                     
              tested, as will hypotheses concerning the form of such                         
              parameters.  Results concerning such parameters will bear in                   
              important ways on questions of syntax acquisition and on                       
              questions of syntact change.
