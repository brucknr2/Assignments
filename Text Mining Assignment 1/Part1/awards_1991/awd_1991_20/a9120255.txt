Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports a team of cultural anthropologists (two                  
              based on the mainland US and one in Puerto Rico) studying the                  
              effect of cultural background on people's responses to pain.  The              
              investigators will collect qualitative information through                     
              intensive interviews and quantitative information through                      
              questionnaires with 100 native Puerto Rican patients suffering                 
              chronic pain, and compare the results with those from a prior                  
              study of Anglo Americans and U.S. mainland Hispanics (mainly of                
              Puerto Rican descent).  The aim of the comparison is to test the               
              hypothesis that socialization within cultural groups influences                
              attitudes and attention to pain which then affects the psycho-                 
              physiological processes of pain perception.  The study will be                 
              attentive to factors influences intra-cultural variation in pain               
              response also.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This study is important because it will contribute to our                      
              knowledge of the ways cultural orientation shapes human's ability              
              to withstand suffering.  At a time when chronic back pain seems                
              to be common, understanding of this sort can clearly help society              
              cope with the affliction.                                                      
                                                                                             
              One of the researchers is handicapped (with chronic pain) and                  
              this support involves special aids to handicapped researchers.
