              This project focuses on an                                                     
              experimental research program for                                              
              seismic rehabilitation of existing                                             
              connections between precast,                                                   
              reinforced concrete tilt-up walls                                              
              and their foundation to improve                                                
              their seismic performance.  This                                               
              cost-effective construction type is                                            
              widely used for office buildings,                                              
              factories, stores, and warehouses.                                             
              It is estimated that about half of                                             
              the R/C industrial facilities are                                              
              built using tilt-up construction.                                              
                                                                                             
              Much of the work performed recently                                            
              in retrofitting tilt-up walls                                                  
              concentrated on the roof-wall                                                  
              connection as it is considered the                                             
              weakest link in the assembly.                                                  
              Little attention has been given to                                             
              another weak link which is the wall-                                           
              foundation connection.  Many of                                                
              these existing connections lack                                                
              adequate ductility and detailing and

              under strong ground shaking.  The
