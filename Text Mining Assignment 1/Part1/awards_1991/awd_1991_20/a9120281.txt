Abstract    :
              This project is supported in the                                               
              Phase 2 (second year) program  of                                              
              the Seismic Repair/Rehabilitation                                              
              Research Initiative (NSF 90-23).                                               
                                                                                             
              Precast concrete tilt-up structures                                            
              are widely used throughout the U.S.                                            
              for one and two-story warehouses,                                              
              office buildings, and shopping                                                 
              centers.  Tilt-up structures are                                               
              economical to build; however, they                                             
              are susceptible to severe structural                                           
              damage during earthquakes.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to                                            
              develop guidelines for evaluating                                              
              the seismic hazards in existing                                                
              tilt-up construction and develop                                               
              methods for mitigating those                                                   
              hazards.  The work focuses on four                                             
              areas:  (1) connection of the roof                                             
              diaphragm to the tilt-up wall                                                  
              panels, (2) connection between                                                 
              adjacent wall panels, (3) connection                                           
              of the wall panels to the floor slab                                           
              and foundation, and (4) strength and                                           
              stability of wall panels with large                                            
              openings.  Analytical models will be                                           
              developed to calculate the dynamic                                             
              response of building systems used                                              
              throughout the U.S. and laboratory                                             
              tests of representative details and                                            
              structural systems will be                                                     
              performed.
