Abstract    :
              Understanding the tectonic framework across the West Antarctic Rift            
              system is critical for deciphering the evolution of the Pacific                
              margin of Gondwana; for understanding the characteristics of wide              
              and narrow modes of continental extension; and for determining the             
              geological controls on the dynamics of the West Antarctic ice                  
              sheet, the globe's last great "marine" ice sheet.  This Award                  
              supports and integrated geophysical experiment including airborne              
              radar and surface altimetry augmented by satellite imagery, in                 
              addition to airborne gravity and aeromagnetic measurements within              
              a carefully chosen West Antarctic corridor.  This corridor covers              
              the western portion of the Byrd Subglacial Basin and the                       
              easternmost portion of the Interior Ross Embayment.  The experiment            
              objectives will be achieved by imaging the tectonic fabric across              
              the West Antarctic Rift system and characterizing the distribution             
              of sedimentary basins, volcanic rocks and important ice dynamical              
              boundaries within this corridor.
