Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Professor Kenneth Janda of the University                  
              of Pittsburgh will use spectroscopy and high-level calculations                
              to study halogen-noble gas van der Waals molecules and small                   
              clusters in order to deduce information about potential energy                 
              surfaces.  The work is a mixture of structural and dynamical                   
              studies which should lead to fundamental information about the                 
              dynamical pathways of chemical reactions as well as the                        
              physical transition from gaseous to condensed phases.

              Cluster molecules are intermediate species formed during the                   
              process when gaseous molecules condense to form liquids or                     
              solids.  The study of the structure and properties of clusters                 
              is useful in understanding such diverse phenomena as molecular                 
              orientation and mobility on catalytic surfaces as well as                      
              protein folding.  The work supported here examines clusters                    
              forming larger and larger entities in order to test the                        
              validity of theoretical models such as the use of pair-                        
              potentials to describe interactions in condensing matter.
