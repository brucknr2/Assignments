Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A program of experimental and theoretical crystal chemistry is                 
              proposed.  The experimental part consists of synthesis by solid-               
              state methods and characterization, principally by X-ray and                   
              neutron diffraction, of new solid ternary nitrides and nitride-                
              fluorides of the metallic elements.  Materials will be screened for            
              interesting electrical and magnetic properties.  The theoretical               
              part consists of (a) extending the bond valence method of analyzing            
              crystal structures to provide a general and rapid method of                    
              simulating crystal structures and (b) development of a general                 
              theory of the topology of infinite periodic nets.  The latter will             
              be used particularly for the computer identification and                       
              classification of structures.
