Abstract    :
              This dissertation project proposal is to study three Native,                   
              Alutiiq, villages on the Alaska Peninsula. This poorly documented              
              cultural group has been able to maintain its ethnic identity in                
              spite of continuous contacts with Russian, American, and other                 
              indigenous groups. The question of how Alutiiq identity has                    
              persisted through two centuries of contact is of fundamental                   
              interest to all Arctic indigenous groups being impacted by                     
              contemporary culture change. The proposed project can make an                  
              important contribution to basic research on Native culture in                  
              Alaska, and will also contribute to the theoretical and                        
              methodological development of cultural anthropology in the Arctic.
