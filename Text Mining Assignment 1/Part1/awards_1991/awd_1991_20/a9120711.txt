Abstract    :
              The goal of this project in the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry program is to probe the structure of transition metal                
              ions adsorbed in microporous molecular sieve oxides.  Electron                 
              magnetic resonance methods will be developed and applied to                    
              these systems by Professor Kevan and his group, and detailed                   
              information about the interaction between the adsorbed                         
              transition metal ion and the framework nuclei of the oxide                     
              support will be obtained.  Comparisons will also be made to                    
              catalytic activity of the characterized materials.  Development                
              of advanced electron magnetic resonance spectroscopic methods                  
              is an additional important goal of this work.

              Structural characterization of oxide supported transition metal                
              ions which are useful as catalytic systems will result from                    
              this work.  This characterization will be crucial to the                       
              further design and understanding of technologically important                  
              oxide supported catalysts used in petroleum refining and                       
              chemical process industries.
