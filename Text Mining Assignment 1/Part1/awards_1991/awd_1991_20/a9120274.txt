Abstract    :
              This work is a continued investigation of Larmor-Wave propagation              
              through pure metal plates at millimeter wave freqencies.  The study            
              will include alkali metals and noble metals.  A new high vacuum                
              facility allows for the first time the fabrication, by sputtering              
              and evaporation, of alkali-metal samples.  The Larmor-wave studies             
              can proceed immediately as the conduction electrons are strongly               
              coupled to ferromagnetic surface layers.  In addition, the                     
              application of ferromagnetic surface layers may well allow the                 
              observation and study of new modes of excitation of the conduction             
              electrons which have been predicted theoretically but not observed             
              as yet.
