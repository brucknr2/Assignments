Abstract    :
              Analytical and numerical research will be undertaken on quantum                
              coherence, charge fluctuation and transport phenomena in mesoscopic            
              structures.  The initial focus of this research will be on a                   
              comprehensive theory of mesoscopic persistent currents in isolated             
              rings, macroscopic quantum tunneling in ultranarrow wires, and                 
              related static and dynamic mesoscopic phenomena.  The goal of this             
              work is the elucidation of the unusual quantum coherence and                   
              statistical mechanical effects that occur in the electronic,                   
              thermal and mechanical properties of submicrometer-sized                       
              structures.  Crossover phenomena that occur in nanometer-scale                 
              superconducting rings and wires will also be studies.                          
              %%%                                                                            
              Mesoscopic physics occurs at the boundary between the classical and            
              quantum regimes.  For instance, as the size of an electronic device            
              decreases, a region will be reached where the classical or semi-               
              classical description which modeled the behavior of the device will            
              no longer apply.  Quantum effects come into play.  Clearly, an                 
              understanding of these effects has an important impact on solid                
              state electronics as the size of devices continues to decrease.  On            
              the other hand, these mesoscopic effects reveal fundamental                    
              properties of condensed matter systems and can themselves be used              
              as bases for devices.
