Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis of acyclic                         
              compounds containing several asymmetric centers.  The                          
              methodology to be developed rests on the use of thermodynamic                  
              equilibration processes to set the centers in place.  The                      
              viability of the approach has been shown with a                                
              1,7-dioxaspiro?5.5!undecane-4,10-dione template that has been                  
              equilibrated to single diastereomers in which 5 asymmetric                     
              centers have been established.  The specific goals of the                      
              project are to extend the preliminary results to more highly                   
              substituted templates, to manipulate the equilibrated                          
              1,7-dioxaspiro?5.5!undecane-4,10-diones to open chain forms and                
              to study entirely diferent templates.

              With this new award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                          
              supporting the research of Dr. Kim F. Albizati of the                          
              Department of Chemsitry at Wayne State University.  Dr.                        
              Albizati will focus his work on developing thermodynamic                       
              equilibration processes as general methodology for the                         
              establishment of several asymmetric centers in a single                        
              transformation, thus promulgating a new strategy for the                       
              synthesis of acyclic organic compounds.
