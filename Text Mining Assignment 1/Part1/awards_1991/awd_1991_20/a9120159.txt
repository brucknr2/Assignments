Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will complete analysis of one of the largest known                
              family reconstitution data sets from Croatia, in historical                    
              Europe.  It will develop and test new statistical methods for                  
              dealing with incomplete data to improve the efficiency of data                 
              recovery.  It will confirm fertility control responses to                      
              fluctuating economic and political conditions and demonstrate                  
              early onset of fertility decline (CA. 1780) as a response to                   
              progressive inmiseration of the population.  It will show that                 
              demographic response is conditioned primarily by economic and                  
              social organizational factors rather than broad cultural factors.              
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it expands and improves the                 
              theory of the demographic transition from large to small                       
              families.  Understanding how this has happened in the past will                
              help us design programs to impact family size in the future.
