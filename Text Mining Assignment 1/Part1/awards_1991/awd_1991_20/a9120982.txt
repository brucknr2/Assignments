Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research is proposed on nucleation processes of vapor and solid in             
              liquid helium 3 and helium 4 as well as in helium 3 / helium 4                 
              solutions, on the equation of state of liquid helium 3, and on the             
              surface of solid helium.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Studies of the properties of the two distinct heliums (isotopes)               
              help advance our understanding of the role of quantum mechanics in             
              the basic structure of matter.
