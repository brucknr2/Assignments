Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will test the working hypothesis that "the                        
              distributions of the respective chemical species follow a                      
              predictable annual pattern, with interannual variability falling               
              within a characteristic 'envelope' driven by  discharge effects                
              on the sequences of (a) tributary inputs, which can be described               
              by a regional chromatography model (b) in situ carbon oxidation,               
              which is maintained through a dynamic equilibrium, and (c)                     
              mainstemvarzea linkages, which are a function of basin structural              
              features.   Specific research objectives include:                              
                                                                                             
              Objective 1. The Regional Chromatograph: (1) Developing a                      
              regional-scale research paradigm (2) Examining the chemical basis              
              for a regional chromatographic model.  (3) Developing the                      
              capability to model water, chemical, and sediment routing at                   
              subbasin scales, and (4) Developing a sampling network for                     
              tributary basin and upriver sampling.                                          
                                                                                             
              Objective 2: Mainstem Dynamics: (1) Determining interannual                    
              variability by continuing the Marchantaria monthly time series                 
              for routine parameters and augmenting these with more detailed                 
              chemical characterizations and maintaining data input from the                 
              DNAEE hydrologic data base.  (2) Examining the "dynamic                        
              equibrium" concept through analyses of the patterns of biogenic                
              gases, bacterial carbon dynamics, temporal variability inorganic               
              composition, and selected N and P forms.  (3) Modeling mainstem                
              routing and mainstem-floodplain exchange through the extension of              
              a 2-dimensional hydrodynamic model, incorporating remote sensing               
              data on water and sediment exchange.                                           
                                                                                             
              The research is pertinent to resolution of major ecological                    
              questions at the continental scale within the preview of global                
              change.  Past work has been productive, and collaborative                      
              arrangements with Brazilian scientists are excellent.
