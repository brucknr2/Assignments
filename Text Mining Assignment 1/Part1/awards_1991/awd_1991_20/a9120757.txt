Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Optimal distinctiveness theory provides a perspective on the role              
              of social group membership in establishing and maintaining                     
              individual self identity.  As an amalgamation of self -                        
              categorization theory, the optimal distinctiveness model                       
              assumes that social identities are selected or adopted by                      
              individuals in order to satify opposing social needs for                       
              differentiation and assimilation.  Group identification will be                
              satisfying to the extent that it provides simultaneously for a                 
              sense of distinctiveness and for inclusion in a social collective.             
              Thus, the theory implies that individuals will seek membership                 
              in groups that are relatively exclusive rather than inclusive,                 
              and will react negatively to threats to ingroup distinctiveness.               
                                                                                             
              Prior research on optimal distinctiveness theory has established               
              that depersonalization (categorization in overly inclusive groups)             
              enhances identification with more distinctive groups, independent              
              of the status associated with group membership.  The current                   
              research, a series of laboratory and field experiments, will test              
              further implications of optimal distinctiveness theory, including              
              (1) group identification in response to excessive personalization              
              (individual uniqueness), (2) effects of social identification on               
              response to intragroup versus intergroup social comparison, (3)                
              effects of group distinctiveness on perceived differentiation among            
              group members, and (4) effects of threat to group distinctiveness              
              on self-presentation and commitment to ingroups.
