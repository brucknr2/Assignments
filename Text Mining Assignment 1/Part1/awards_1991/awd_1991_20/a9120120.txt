Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant examines the electronic structure of several binary                 
              metallic alloy systems, concentrating on the Cu-Au, Ag-Mg, and Fe-             
              Ni systems.  A combination of ultra-violet and X-ray photoelectron             
              spectroscopies and first principles electronic structure and                   
              photocurrent calculations are employed.  Order-disorder and the                
              relationship between electronic configuration and magnetism are                
              explored.  The selected alloy systems have intermetallic compounds             
              with long-period superlattice structures.  Energy bands are mapped             
              in ordered and disordered CuAu and AgMg using angle-resolved                   
              photoemission measurements.  In the Fe-Ni system large changes in              
              magnetic properties occur with composition and structure changes.              
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              New insights into the electronic structure of metallic alloys                  
              should result from the research.  The alloys selected are of                   
              interest from their intermetallic compound formation and/or their              
              magnetic properties.
