Abstract    :
              Silverman         A strong research program in the areas of computing 
              architectures for advanced speech recognition, algorithms, and  experimentation
              is currently in place in the Laboratory for  Engineering Man/machine Systems
              (LEMS) at Brown. This research  focuses on a reconfigurable, general-purpose,
              computing  structure, and speech recognition/training algorithms, to advance 
              the state-of-the-art in both areas through their interaction.         One
              feature of these efforts is the evaluation of the  effects of changes to the
              early stages of a speech recognizer.  This computationally intensive task will
              utilize the projected  Armstrong III reconfigurable hardware system to
              accelerate the  current training algorithm.         A second feature is the
              incorporation of improvements to the  current computational and recognition
              performance of a talker-  independent, connected alphadigit recognizer,
              database, training,  and tools, all developed at Brown. These include
              microphone-array  data acquisition, new signal-processing algorithms, non- 
              parametric modeling, better durational modeling, and new  VQ/feature-space
              methods.
