Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project involves multidisciplinary (seismic,                         
              magnetotelluric) transects along and across the Sierra Nevada in               
              order to examine the crust and upper mantle beneath these                      
              mountains.  The principal investigators hope to resolve the cause              
              of uplift of the Sierra Nevada and its relation to the adjoining               
              Death Valley extensional province and the southern San Joaquin                 
              basin.  Currently, two end-member models for uplift of the range               
              have been presented.  These are:  (a) isostatic compensation of a              
              deep crustal root and (b) upwelling of the asthenosphere                       
              associated with extension to the east.  These two models have                  
              fundamentally different consequences for the dynamic behavior of               
              the continents, particularly in the manner in which crustal                    
              sections are either (a) underplated by materials from the upper                
              mantle or (b) weakened and extruded to fill in extensional voids.              
              In addition to the uplift and related extension of comparable                  
              mountain ranges worldwide, examples of globally significant                    
              features that will be better understood by resolution of the                   
              Sierran root question include:  factors controlling the manner in              
              which sialic basement nappes detach; how collision zones collapse              
              under their own burden; and how intracontinental transform faults              
              partition strain to and beyond the Moho.
