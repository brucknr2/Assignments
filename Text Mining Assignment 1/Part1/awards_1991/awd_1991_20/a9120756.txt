Abstract    :
              This is a multi-disciplinary conference that brings together                   
              leading researchers, commentators and policy makers concerned                  
              with issues of the impact of computer technology on society.  The              
              conferees survey the implications for privacy and freedom of the               
              interaction of computers, computer data banks, and computer                    
              networks with electronic mail, computerized personal information,              
              direct marketing information and government data, including data               
              related to human genomes.  A book with ten articles on the                     
              subjects of the conference will be published.  The Conference is               
              scheduled for March 18 - 20, 1992 at the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel in
