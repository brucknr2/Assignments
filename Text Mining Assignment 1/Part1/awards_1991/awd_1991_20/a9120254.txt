Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Professor Richard Mathies of the University                
              of California, Berkeley, will use a combination of Raman and                   
              femtosecond laser methods to try to elucidate the molecular                    
              mechanism and the ground and excited-state molecular dynamics                  
              of condensed phase photochemical and photobiological reactions.                
              The mode-specific dynamics of nuclear motion that occur                        
              immediately after optical excitation will be followed on a                     
              femtosecond time scale, and key intermediates in the                           
              photochemical reactions will be identified and characterized                   
              using picosecond Raman and absorption spectroscopy.  The types                 
              of reaction to be explore include hydrogen shift reactions,                    
              visual pigment isomerization, photochrome isomerization, and                   
              electron transfer in bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers.                
              %%%                                                                            
              These planned studies by Professor Mathies aim at understanding                
              the physical and chemical processes that take place in the                     
              liquid or solid state when light excites specific constituents.                
              The proposed combination of systems and techniques should aid                  
              in developing a complete description of the atomic motions                     
              which occur during chemical reactions, from the early dynamics                 
              of the transient excited species to those of the relaxed                       
              equilibrium products.  Included in this research are studies of                
              biological systems involving light-sensing pigments.
