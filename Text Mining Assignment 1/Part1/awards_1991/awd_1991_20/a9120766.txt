              International Conference on Ultra-Relativistic Nucleus-Nucleus                 
              Collisions; Gatlinburg, TN Nov. 11-15, 1991.  This conference                  
              will provide the world's major forum for the latest research                   
              results in the forefront field of relativistic heavy-ion                       
              collisions and the search for quark-gluon plasma.  There will                  
              be about 300 participants from all over the world.
