Abstract    :
                   This project continues work on the relationship between                   
              academic research and its payoff in industrial innovation utilizing            
              a unique data base from previous research.  Having estimated the               
              high public return rates in seven industries from the total                    
              investment in academic research, this project will gather data and             
              information on:  (1) the sources of financial support for academic             
              research that has contributed significantly to industrial                      
              innovation; (2) the role of geographic proximity of the academic               
              researchers and industrial users; (3) the relationship of high                 
              payoff academic research to departmental quality ratings; (4) the              
              time frame of social benefits and costs from industrial innovation             
              based on academic research; and (5) begin preliminary work on the              
              economic effects of the industry cooperative research centers.
