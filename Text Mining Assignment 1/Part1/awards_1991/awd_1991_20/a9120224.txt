Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports continuing studies of polarization and                     
              spectra of variable extragalactic radio sources.  The work of                  
              this group has been unique in providing long-term monitoring of                
              the intensity and polarization of these interesting objects.                   
              Continuation of this research, together with VLBI studies and                  
              theoretical investigations of their inner structure will further               
              constrain and test emission region models and refine a new method              
              for the direct determination of the distances of active galactic               
              nuclei.
