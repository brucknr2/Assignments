Abstract    :
                   This action funds an Interagency agreement with the Bureau                
              of the Census to support a pretest of the 1993 postcensal survey               
              of college graduates.  The postcensal survey collects data on                  
              education, training and employment related to science and                      
              engineering from a nationally representative sample of persons                 
              with bachelor's degrees (or higher).  These data are used in                   
              NSF's Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System (STPDS).
