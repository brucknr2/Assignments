Abstract    :
              In the last several years the level of research activityof the                 
              Miami Biochemistry division has increased dramatically.  The                   
              division has added a new faculty member (a new position) and                   
              obtained $975,000 in research funding including four grants from               
              NSF.  This increase in research activity has identified several                
              inadequacies in the divisions' instrumentation.  Several o fthe                
              funded research projects require capabilities not currently                    
              available in the division.  The required instrumentation are:  a               
              supraspeed centrifuge and rotors, a gradient HPLC system with                  
              microbore capabilities to isolate ug quantitites of protein, and a             
              scanning UV/visibile spectrophotometer with high sensitivity.  All             
              three pieces of equipment, commonly found in biochemistry                      
              laboratories, are essential to at least two of the PIs and will be             
              used occasionally by the other three groups in the division.  The              
              requested instruments will be used to support and enhance the                  
              following research projects:  1) development regulation of plant               
              mitochondrial biogenesis and pollen development, 2) metabolic                  
              regulation and biosynthesis of fatty acids in plant, and 3) the                
              role of tannins in plant-herbivore interactions.
