Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Funds are provided to help defray costs for participants and                   
              young scientists to attend an International Conference on                      
              Melanotropic Peptides.  Melanotropins, (melanocyte-stimulating                 
              hormones, MSH; melanin-concentrating hormone, MCH) were among the              
              first peptides to be structurally analyzed and to be chemically                
              synthesized.  While their biological effects on pigmentation,                  
              especially in invertebrate species, have been widely appreciated,              
              it is clear that melanotropins affect the central nervous system               
              and specific peripheral organs.  This conference will address the              
              important advances being made on the biosynthesis, secretion and               
              molecular mechanisms of action of these peptides.  It covers the               
              full spectrum of topics from the discovery of MSH to most current              
              knowledge of its role as neuropeptides.  The conference's format               
              provides the atmosphere to foster meaningful interchanges between              
              an interdisciplinary group of scientists.  The final discussion                
              will speculate on how these rapid advances in basic research may               
              lead to the potential clinical use of melanotropins in the                     
              diagnosis and therapy of melanoma, the treatment of pigment                    
              disorders, nerve damage and dementia.
