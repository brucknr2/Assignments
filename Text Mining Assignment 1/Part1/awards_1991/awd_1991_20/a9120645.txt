Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Georgia wishes to achieve these objectives: 1) to            
              expand the existing PeachNet services to include University System             
              outreach programs; 2) to pilot a project to create a networking                
              model whereby private and public shcool systems may be integrated              
              into Georgia's public higher education network system; 3) to                   
              provide for network resource management; and 4) to provide access              
              to NSFNET for 45 units connected to PeachNet.  Specifically the                
              following schools will be directly aided: Atlanta Metropolitain                
              College, Clayton State College, Dalton College, Gainesville                    
              College, Gordon College, North Georgia College, and Middle Georgia             
              College.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The expansion to connect the additional state supported                        
              institutions to PeachNet and NSFNET will provide Georgia educators             
              and students an opportunity to share resources with the current                
              eachNet and NSFNET communities.***
