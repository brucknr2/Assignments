Abstract    :
              The proposed study will derive an evolutionary tree for the rails              
              (Aves, Rallidae), a large, ecologically diverse, and globally                  
              distributed family of typically "chicken-like" birds.  Of this                 
              family, at least 58 species (including extinct species), roughly               
              one-third of its members, are (were) flight-impaired or                        
              flightless.  Within the historical frame work of the phylogenetic              
              tree, an existing body of mensural data for the flightless                     
              species and their flighted relatives, and dissections of pectoral              
              musculature in selected species-pairs, will be used to determine               
              the anatomical changes associated with the repeated evolution of               
              flightlessness in the group.  Anatomical study will include                    
              microscopic examination of developmental mechanisms that produced              
              the instances of flightlessness will also be determined, with                  
              particular attention being given possible evolutionary changes in              
              the timing of developmental events (heterochrony). Finally, the                
              geographical and ecological trends in flightless rails will be                 
              summarized, particularly possible changes in feeding behavior,                 
              habitat, and parameters of reproduction, patterns of extinction,               
              and the ecological and genetic importance of insularity.
