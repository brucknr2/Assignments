Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Sea turtle hatchlings emerge from underground nests on sandy                   
              oceanic beaches, scramble to the sea, and swim toward the open                 
              ocean in a migration lasting several days.  During the migration,              
              hatchlings quickly establish a seaward course, then hold this                  
              heading even after they swim beyond sight of land.                             
                                                                                             
              Little is known about how hatchling sea turtles can maintain a                 
              straight course through a vast ocean that contains no obvious                  
              landmarks.  Recent experiments have revealed that hatchling                    
              loggerhead sea turtles from the Atlantic coast of Florida can                  
              detect the magnetic field of the earth and use it as a cue to                  
              guide their migration.  Dr. Lohmann's experiments are designed to              
              study the newly discovered magnetic compass sense of sea turtle                
              hatchlings and to provide insight into how sea turtles use                     
              magnetic cues in navigation.                                                   
                                                                                             
              All species of sea turtles are now either endangered or                        
              threatened.  Dr. Lohmann's research is expected to provide                     
              information useful to conservation workers trying to save sea                  
              turtles from extinction.  In addition, it is expected to help                  
              scientists understand how other migratory animals (such as birds,              
              fish, and whales) use information from the earth's magnetic field              
              to navigate.
