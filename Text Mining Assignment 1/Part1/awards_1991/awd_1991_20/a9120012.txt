Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Atmospheric Sciences Department at Creighton University will               
              expand it PC network and add a UNIX base workstation to the                    
              network.  The present PC configuration which runs McIDAS software              
              has proven to be a useful tool for interactive display of                      
              meteorological data, but this system is inadequate to meet the                 
              teaching and research goals of the department.  This award will                
              augment Creighton's present network which consists of IBM Models 80            
              and 70.  Funds to purchase three new 486-based PC will be awarded.             
              In addition, a UNIX-based workstation will be awarded.  The                    
              workstation will greatly enhance the capability with the addition              
              of a workstation to run several meteorological software packages               
              which are not available on PC hardware.  This new equipment will               
              become a vital tool in many of Creighton's classes which expose                
              students to computer-based meteorological displays.  The additional            
              equipment also will expand opportunities for undergraduate and                 
              graduate research.
