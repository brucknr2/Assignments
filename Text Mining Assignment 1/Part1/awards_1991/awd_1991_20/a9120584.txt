Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports a cultural anthropologist with extensive                 
              experience in Africa and in the Philippines studying the home-                 
              town linkages of urban workers in Yoruba society, Nigeria.  In                 
              contemporary third-world societies, many people are highly mobile              
              but maintain ties with their home base.  This project studies how              
              hometown links are operationalized in the context of the 1980's                
              economic crisis.  Using ethnographic and survey methods, the                   
              project will examine individual, family, and organizational links              
              to the hometown, analyzing gender and socioeconomic differences                
              in the reliance on these ties.  Information from Africa will be                
              compared with the investigator's similar case study from the                   
              Philippines.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This study is important because it will provide a corrective to                
              the simplistic view of third world migration as "push" from                    
              opportunity-poor rural areas and "pull" from opportunity-rich                  
              urban sites.  The reality is that urban migrants maintain                      
              important ties with their place of origin. The knowledge from                  
              this case study will be useful to those concerned with urban                   
              problems in the third world, as it will illuminate the reasons                 
              and values behind rural-urban population movements.
