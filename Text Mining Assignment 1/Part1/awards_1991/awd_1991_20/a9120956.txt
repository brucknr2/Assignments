Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A genetic approach to the investigation of the regulation and                  
              function of calcium channels is expected to increase our                       
              understanding of regulation of intracellular calcium ion that is               
              essential for the normal functioning of the brain, muscle and                  
              secretion of hormones.  At the present time, the mechanisms that               
              control whether these channels are open, allowing calcium to be                
              moved across the membrane, or closed are largely unknown.  By                  
              selectively destroying one component (beta subunit) of the                     
              proteins that make up the structure of the channel the function                
              of the channel can be determined directly from                                 
              electrophysiological or chemical studies of the movement of                    
              calcium into cells.  These experiments will be done using cells                
              in culture.  Genetically altered mice will be produced that lack               
              this protein.  These experiments will extend the results obtained              
              in tissue culture to allow the determination of the role of this               
              protein in normal growth and development of the mouse.                         
              Understanding how calcium channels are controlled will provide                 
              valuable insight into their role in normal brain and muscle                    
              function.
