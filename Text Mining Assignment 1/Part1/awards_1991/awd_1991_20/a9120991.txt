Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Classrooms of 30 to 300 students, although commonplace,                        
              provide poor learning environments in schools and colleges.                    
              Active learning significantly improves on traditional                          
              methods.  With low-cost classroom communications systems                       
              (CCSc) every student can engage actively in learning, but                      
              results are not guaranteed.  Teachers must learn how to use                    
              CCSs' as pedagogical tools.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Objectives: provide substantive data on the benefits of CCSs                   
              in various educational environments; show how CCSs can be                      
              adapted to various pedagogies to enhance the effectiveness                     
              of the learning environment; quantify the effects of these                     
              adaptions on student performance.                                              
                                                                                             
              Research: Scientist-teachers from eight national programs                      
              will test Classtalk CCSs' capabilities in research                             
              classrooms.  Feedback from pilot research at these test-                       
              sites will help optimize the tools and interface.  In the                      
              principal effort, test-site researchers will do controlled                     
              evaluations of CCS impact on their own pedagogical                             
              frameworks.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Anticipated Results: We will learn how to use CCSs                             
              effectively under various classroom pedagogies and what                        
              software tools make CCSs maximally effective                                   
                                                                                             
              Applications: Successful CCSs are cost-effective tools                         
              enabling all students to engage actively in learning.  CCSs                    
              help identify students' preconceptions and diagnose                            
              fundamental misunderstandings.  CCSs may incorporate video                     
              and other technologies, improve students' motivation, and                      
              help teachers to track and assess student learning.
