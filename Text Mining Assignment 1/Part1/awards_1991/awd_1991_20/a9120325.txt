Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Packed bed multitube reactors are used in chemical processes                   
              such as partial oxidation, chlorination, hydrogenation and                     
              dehydrogenation.  The multitube arrangement facilitates heat                   
              exchange, to improve process selectivity and stability by                      
              reducing temperature variations in the catalyst beds.                          
                                                                                             
              The PI is planning to design packed-tube reactors using a                      
              data-                                                                          
              based transport function.  The function will be constructed                    
              from measurements of temperature responses to localized wall                   
              and                                                                            
              particle heating under laminar and turbulent flow conditions.                  
                                                                                             
              Packed-bed reactors will be simulated numerically by combining                 
              the transport function with the local kinetics of the given                    
              process.  The experiments and correlation studies will be                      
              continued to                                                                   
              establish the transport function to practical accuracy for                     
              several geometries.  Numerical methods and software for the                    
              approach will be developed for high-performance parallel                       
              computers and will be tested on chemical process examples.                     
              The research will provide a database for computer-aided                        
              engineering of packed-tube catalytic processes.  The approach                  
              also has potential applications to other kinds of reactors and                 
              separation systems.
