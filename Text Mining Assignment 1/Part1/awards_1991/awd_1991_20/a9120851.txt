Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with mathematical techniques fromnatural             
              language processing systems- specifically, fromunification-based               
              grammar formalism- to help in the design odata and knowledge bases.            
              These techniques include the use offeature theory, features logic,             
              hyperset theory, and type systemsfrom polymorphic functional                   
              programming languages.  The goal ofthe project is to use these                 
              techniques to move knowledge and datamodels closer together, while             
              providing for at least some aspectsof heterogeneity in knowledge               
              bases.
