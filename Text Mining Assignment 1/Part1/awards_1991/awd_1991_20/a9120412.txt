Abstract    :
              In addition to its role as a nutrient, the essential iron acts as              
              a regulatory signal to control synthesis of iron acquisition                   
              systems, certain toxins, and a variety of other bacterial proteins.            
              Thus iron is one of a number of environmental stimuli to which                 
              cells respond.  The long range goals of this project are to                    
              characterize the genetics and regulation of iron acquisition and               
              other systems associated with in vivo survival of Shigella, an                 
              enteric bacterium which multiplies both extracellularly and                    
              intracellularly within host intestinal epithelial cells.  These                
              studies will include (1) characterizing genes and gene products                
              which are differentially expressed in vivo and the associated                  
              regulatory signals, (2) measuring the expression of iron-regulated             
              genes in an in vivo system, and (3) characterizing the genetics and            
              regulation of Congo red/heme binding (crb).  Experimental                      
              approaches will utilize genetic and biochemical techniques.  In                
              vivo expression of the genes will be investigated using fusions to             
              reporter genes whose expression can be readily monitored , and an              
              in vivo labeling system has been developed to compare proteins                 
              synthesized by bacteria inside host cells to those observed in                 
              vitro.  Mutants with altered gene regulation will also be                      
              characterized.  These studies will help define mechanisms of                   
              regulation both in vivo and in vitro.
