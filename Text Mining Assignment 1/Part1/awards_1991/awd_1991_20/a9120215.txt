Abstract    :
              This action is in response to the NSF                                          
              Announcement of Program Initiative No. 91-55:                                  
              "The 'Class A' Prediction Phase of the                                         
              VELACS (Verification of Liquefaction Analysis                                  
              by Centrifuge Studies) Project".  VELACS is                                    
              an NSF-funded coordinated study of the effect                                  
              of simulated earthquake loading on a variety of                                
              model geotechnical structures, such as earth                                   
              dams and embankments, in order to investigate                                  
              the mechanisms of liquefaction-induced failure,                                
              and to acquire data for the verification of the                                
              various analysis procedures for the liquefaction                               
              problem.  The experiments are run on the                                       
              geotechnical centrifuges at the California

              The "Class A" prediction phase of the                                          
              VELACS project involves making                                                 
              analytical/computational predictions before the                                
              experiments are performed; then the                                            
              experiments are run, and the measured results                                  
              compared with the predictions.  "Class A"                                      
              predictions are analogous to "single-blind"                                    
              studies in medical research.  A workshop,                                      
              scheduled to be held at the University of                                      
              California, Davis, in September, 1993, will                                    
              compare the predictions to the experimental                                    
              results, and conclusions will be drawn regarding                               
              the effectiveness of the analytical/computational                              
              methods used.  Sixteen research groups from                                    
              around the world (nine in the U.S.; one in                                     
              Canada; three in Japan; and three in the U.K.)                                 
              are participating in this prediction exercise.                                 
                                                                                             
              This study at the University of California,                                    
              Davis is examining the effectiveness of the                                    
              DYSAC2 computer code for liquefaction                                          
              analysis.
