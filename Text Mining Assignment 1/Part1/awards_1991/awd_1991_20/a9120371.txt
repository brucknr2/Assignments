Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the feasibility of combining a steel             
              center core encased with various types of like material such as                
              glass, aramids, carbon, etc, to form a hybrid reinforcement to                 
              resist corrosion when used as reinforcement in concrete structures.
