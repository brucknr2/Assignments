Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting a research program by Robert                  
              G. Parr at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in                   
              which he is continuing his work on density functional theory.                  
              The new work continues the development of qualitative                          
              applications of the theory to a variety of systems of chemical                 
              significance.  It also involves cooperation with Professor Yang                
              of Duke University on further extension of the "divide and                     
              conquer" strategy they have developed for computational                        
              applications of the theory.                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Density functional theory is an alternative to the commonly                    
              used ab initio approach to the quantum chemical description of                 
              molecules.  It can be used in a qualitative manner to permit                   
              the deduction of useful correlations and generalizations with                  
              limited computational requirements.  This research effort is                   
              developing further applications and techniques to broaden the                  
              utility of the method and apply it to currently puzzling                       
              chemical phenomena.
