Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Eric Herbst at Ohio State University will continue a program               
              of research in the chemistry of interstellar clouds made up of gas             
              and dust.  Portions of these clouds are in the process of                      
              collapsing to form new stars and probably planets as well.  The                
              objectives of this research program are to understand the various              
              types of chemical processes that are occurring under the unusual               
              physical conditions present in interstellar clouds and to utilize              
              these processes in large scale simulations of the chemistry.  Up               
              to now Dr. Herbst's simulations have utilized only chemical                    
              reactions occurring in the gas phase of interstellar clouds; he                
              will now include processes occurring on tiny dust particles as                 
              well.  Dr. Herbst also intends to study a variety of chemical                  
              processes that occur in interstellar clouds that are poorly                    
              understood in the laboratory.
