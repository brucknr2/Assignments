Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The main effort in this project will be the evaluation and                     
              interpretation of the thermodynamics of various processes of                   
              biochemical interest.  in most cases the primary method of                     
              investigation will be isothermal titration calorimetry.  other                 
              observational techniques will be employed as appropriate, including            
              differential scanning microcalorimetry, fluorescence emission and              
              CED and UV spectrometry.                                                       
                                                                                             
              A large fraction of the research will be carried out in                        
              collaboration with individuals in other laboratories.  The                     
              phenomena to be studied will include the following: (1) The binding            
              of glycopeptides to concanavalin A; (2) The interaction of modified            
              S-Peptides with S-protein to form modified ribonuclease S; (3) The             
              binding of substrate analogs and inhibitors to wild type and mutant            
              forms of ribonuclease T1, staphylococcal nuclease, and T4 lysozyme;            
              (4) The interaction between mutated forms of Streptomyces                      
              subtilisin inhibitor and subtilisin and other proteases; (5) The               
              binding of modified corepressors to E. coli tryptophan                         
              aporepressor; (6) The effect of glycosylation on the thermal                   
              stability of proteins such as staphylococcal nuclease and                      
              takamylase; and the binding of cyclosporin by cyclophyllin.
