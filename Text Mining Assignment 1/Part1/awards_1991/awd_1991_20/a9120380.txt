Abstract    :
              This project is an integrated study of the optical and physical                
              properties of the antarctic snow surface.  It has several                      
              components which concern the processes by which global climatic                
              variability is imprinted into the proxy data recorded in the                   
              antarctic ice.   The effect of surface roughness (sastrugi                     
              orientation) on the angular distribution of reflected sunlight, and            
              the spectral distribution of thermal infrared radiation will be                
              measured to provide the knowledge necessary for the interpretation             
              of Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) satellite data.  The               
              mechanism of dry deposition of atmospheric sulfates in the snow                
              surface will be measured by observing the air flow in the permeable            
              upper firn, and samples of hoarfrost and will be examined for their            
              isotopic composition.  The former will allow the evaluation of the             
              extent to which the concentration of aerosols in the firn and ice              
              represent contemporaneous concentrations in the atmosphere, while              
              the latter will yield a comparative study of isotopic ratios to the            
              ambient air temperatures.  Earlier work had been concerned with                
              austral summer conditions.  The present project extends the                    
              measurement program to austral winter conditions.
