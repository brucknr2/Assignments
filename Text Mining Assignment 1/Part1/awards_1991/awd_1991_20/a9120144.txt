Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Blood vessels play a critical role in supplying tissues with                   
              nutrients and gases while removing wastes. In the brain, blood                 
              vessels play an additional role in protecting nerve tissue from                
              fluctuations of constituents that may occur elsewhere in the body.             
              How blood vessels in the brain play this dual role is the subject              
              of the research covered in the proposal.                                       
              The work proposed here focuses on the blood vessels in amphibians              
              and in reptiles. These animals have a unique arrangement of vessels            
              in the brain and it is proposed that the arrangement itself plays              
              an important role in how they work. Understanding how this unique              
              blood vessel geometry works will allow us to understand the                    
              advantages and limitations to other vascular arrangements as well.
