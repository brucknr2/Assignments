Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Center for Microbial Ecology at Michigan State University is               
              dedicated to understanding the underlying principles of microbial              
              ecology with specific emphasis on the competitiveness, diversity               
              and function of microorganisms in natural and managed habitats.                
              Results of center supported research will impact directly on all               
              areas where microorganisms play a dominant role; eg. groundwater               
              quality, hazardous waste disposal, plant productivity, and the                 
              regulation of agricultural and environmental biotechnologies.                  
                                                                                             
              Around the largest group of microbial ecologists in the world,                 
              the Center has gathered researchers and students in molecular                  
              genetics, ecology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, and                    
              computer science. Research is organized into thrust areas that                 
              require multidisciplinary teams of scientists which results in a               
              unique interdisciplinary research and educational environment.                 
              Educational activities emphasize training graduate students and                
              postdoctoral fellows but also include a vigorous multi-level                   
              outreach program.                                                              
                                                                                             
              An industrial alliance program facilitates knowledge transfer                  
              from the Center to industry and stimulates mutually beneficial                 
              collaborative projects with the private sector. The Center's                   
              strong linkages with federal, state and local agencies will                    
              have a significant impact on policies promulgated by these                     
              agencies on issues related to microbial ecology and the                        
              environment. Finally, the Center has established three unique                  
              collaborative research programs with Japan, the USSR and Denmark               
              which will provide exchange students and faculty with                          
              intellectually and culturally broadening experiences.
