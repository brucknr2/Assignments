Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds for the purchase of a high                      
              performance workstation, frame grabber and high resolution                     
              camera to support research in image processing and computer                    
              vision.  The equipment will be used for several research                       
              projects including Fourier domain motion estimation,                           
              representation and matching of deformable objects, and                         
              multirate model-based image compression.                                       
                                                                                             
              High performance computer equipment is required to handle the                  
              complex, data intensive problems found in image processing                     
              and computer vision problems.  The University of Illinois at                   
              Chicago will be purchasing an image processing system to                       
              support research in motion estimation, representation and                      
              matching of deformable objects, and image compression.
