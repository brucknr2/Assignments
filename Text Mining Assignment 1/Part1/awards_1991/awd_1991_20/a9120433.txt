Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There are a variety of ways of exploring the brain basis of                    
              psychological abilities such as visual attention.  One of these                
              approaches is to study how the postnatal development of cortical               
              circuits gives rise to the onset of components of visual                       
              attention in the human infant.  Due to the importance of visual                
              attention in early infancy, it is evident that this approach may               
              also be of clinical benefit.  Furthermore, an understanding of                 
              the relation between postnatal cortical development and the                    
              emergence of cognitive abilities would clearly be a major advance              
              for both developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience.                  
                                                                                             
              This research program is designed to test predictions of                       
              Johnson's theory about the relation between cortical maturation                
              and the development of visual attention.  This theory uses                     
              developmental neuroanatomical evidence to predict the sequence in              
              which certain cortical circuits become functional.  Since these                
              circuits are thought to subserve components of visual attention,               
              this allows predictions to be made about their developmental                   
              sequence.  In human infants between 2 and 6 months of age these                
              predictions will be tested by studying performance in certain                  
              tasks known to be specifically sensitive to the functioning of                 
              these cortical pathways.  In addition, new "marker tasks" will be              
              developed to make possible the investigation of "covert" visual                
              attention i.e. shifts of attention that are independent of eye                 
              movements.  Finally, work will be done on developing a                         
              standardized infant visual attention screening test.  This test                
              will subsequently be used in conjunction with neuroimaging                     
              techniques to investigate directly the neural basis of visual                  
              attention during infancy.
