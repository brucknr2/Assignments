Abstract    :
              Eight private colleges in Nebraska are establishing connections to             
              NSFNET via  56,000 bits per second lines through the MIDNET                    
              mid-level network.  The connections enhance collaborations of                  
              campus researchers with colleagues in several fields such as                   
              biology, psychology, computer science and music, and enables                   
              on-line access to remote bibliography databases and supercomputers.            
              This award funds part of the costs for two years.
