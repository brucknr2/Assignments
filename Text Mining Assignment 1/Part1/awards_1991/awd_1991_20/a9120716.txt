Abstract    :
              In ca. AD 600, a catastrophic eruption by the Laguna Caldera                   
              volcano in El Salvador completely buried a Mayan homestead and                 
              the fields which surrounded it.  Preliminary excavations at this               
              site of Ceren in 1978 indicated that the volcanic ash packed                   
              around and thoroughly preserved structures, wooden artifacts,                  
              trees, corn plants, a field with footprints, and human bodies.                 
              Subsequent geophysical prospection in 1979 confirmed the                       
              existence of intact houses which remain buried under five meters               
              of ash.  NSF funded research in 1989 and 1990 revealed extremely               
              well preserved remains.  Dr. Sheets and his colleagues will                    
              return to this site and continue their extensive excavation which              
              will focus on a single structure and surrounding environment.                  
              Floral and faunal materials will be recovered and analyzed to                  
              reconstruct household subsistence, and expected skeletal                       
              materials will provide insight into family composition.  Field                 
              excavation will allow reconstruction of agricultural techniques.               
                                                                                             
              Ceren is unique, even in comparison to Old World sites such as                 
              Pompeii, because the volcanic ash matrix is so fine that it                    
              preserves organic materials down to the cellular level.  This                  
              virtually complete material culture record will allow for a                    
              detailed reconstruction of functioning households and important                
              insights to human behavior, demography, nutrition, agriculture,                
              and economics.  Anthropologists have come to realize that in many              
              societies the "household" - a group of individuals who live                    
              together in one place and closely cooperate on a daily basis-                  
              form an essential unit.  However, archaeologically households are              
              usually difficult to isolate and study.  At Ceren it appears that              
              just such a unit exists.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it will shed a new and                      
              important light on the development of complex Mayan society and                
              help us to understand how complexity develops and is maintained.
