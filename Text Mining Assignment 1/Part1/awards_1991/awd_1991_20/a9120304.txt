Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PI plans to develop a technique to measure changes in the             
              oxygen concentration of the Earth's atmosphere.  Specifically, the             
              goal is to measure changes as small as 1 ppm in the O2 mole                    
              fraction of air, using differential-absorption spectroscopy.  The              
              research is motivated by the desire to obtain experimental data on             
              the short and long-term variations in atmospheric oxygen for                   
              further understanding of the carbon cycle in the atmosphere,                   
              biosphere, and oceans; it is highly possible that such data would              
              help answer the question of the missing carbon in the atmosphere,              
              the missing oxygen in the oceans, and predict O2 and CO2                       
              concentrations.  The work will be split into three phases:  1)                 
              construction and testing of a diode laser and an electronic-noise              
              canceller; 2) building the reference and sample cells, contructing             
              the gas-handling system and incorporating the system for changing              
              the optical path length through the sample oxygen cell; and 3)                 
              measurements to demonstrate the utility and robustness of the                  
              technique.
