Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to understand at the molecular level               
              the sequence of events in the activation of complement by immune               
              complexes.  A variety of mutant C1s's (a subunit of C1, the first              
              component of the complement system) will be expressed in the                   
              baculovirus insect cell system.  Attempts will be made to                      
              crystallize these mutant proteins for structure studies.                       
              Monoclonal antibodies will be employed as probes of the structure              
              of C1 and the manner in which the subunits Cls, Clr and Clq are                
              combined.  Electron microscopy will be also used in determining the            
              locations of binding sites of antibody to Clr and Cls.
