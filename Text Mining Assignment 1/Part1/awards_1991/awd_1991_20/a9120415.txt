Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              The goal is to investigate the architecture of the language                    
              processing system via the study of how the system copes with                   
              ambiguity.  Two classes of models are contrasted:  serial models,              
              in which only one interpretation of an ambiguity is considered, and            
              constrained parallel models, in which several interpretations may              
              be briefly considered in parallel.  A second factor is whether                 
              probabilistic cues may influence the interpretation(s) that are                
              generated for an ambiguity.  Two different ambiguities are                     
              investigated:  syntactic ambiguities and pronominal reference                  
              ambiguities.  The specific aims are to investigate 1) the                      
              interaction of cues that are encountered before an ambiguity and               
              ones encountered after an ambiguity, 2) the interaction of cues                
              from different levels of linguistics representations, such as                  
              syntactic and discourse-level cues, and 3) individual differences              
              in ambiguity resolution as a function of working memory capacity.              
                                                                                             
              Earlier research has relied heavily on one dependent measure,                  
              reading time at the disambiguation.  Six supplementary measures are            
              proposed:  1) examination of reading time in other regions, 2)                 
              studies in which ambiguities are resolved with a highly favored                
              interpretation, 3) examination of cues that follow the ambiguity,              
              4) norming of stimuli to manipulate cue strength on a continuum, 5)            
              the use of examination of individual differences.  It is expected              
              that the addition of these methods will distinguish the opposing               
              models more precisely than in much previous work.
