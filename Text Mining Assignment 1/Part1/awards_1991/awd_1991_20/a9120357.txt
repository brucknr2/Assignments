Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This grant supports a graduate student who will pursue a Ph.D             
              through this research, the goal of which is to understand the total            
              variability of the East Asian monsoon as a component of the earth's            
              climate system.  The PIs plan to carry out a study of the East                 
              Asian monsoon rainfall and its relationship with global scale                  
              variability using advanced time series analyses.  The objectives of            
              the research are to:                                                           
                                                                                             
                   - identify conclusively the principal spatial and temporal                
                   modes of rainfall variability in East Asian monsoon rainfall              
                                                                                             
                   - investigate relationship between EAM rainfall and large                 
                   scale environmental parameters such as SST, radiation,                    
                   circulation in various time domains.                                      
                                                                                             
                   - use results of analyses to test and validate theories of                
                   monsoon dynamics                                                          
                                                                                             
                   This research will make use of both observational data and GCM            
              output.  Observational data include:  185 stations of 30 years                 
              daily rainfall data over East Asia, weekly to monthly SST from CAC,            
              surface wind, SST and cloudiness from COADS, analyzed wind from NMC            
              and ECMWF, and OLR from NOAA/NESDIS.  Also used are outputs from               
              long-term integration of the GLA and COLA GCM.  This research is               
              important because it seeks to understand the processes that control            
              the East Asian monsoon, a major feature of the climate system.
