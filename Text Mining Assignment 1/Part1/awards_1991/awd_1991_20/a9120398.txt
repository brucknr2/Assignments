Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research directed toward improved understanding and                
              interrelationships of  the atomic structural, electronic and                   
              vibrational properties of metal-semiconductor interfaces will be

              mentation of MEIS for surface analysis, and the proposed program               
              brings together an impressive array of advanced surface analysis               
              techniques to assist in the fundamental studies proposed. The                  
              research aims to understand the correlation between Schottky                   
              barrier behavior and general metal-semiconductor interface atomic              
              level structure and electronic properties.

              This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental                        
              understanding of metal-semiconductor interfaces and their                      
              relationship to Schottky barrier behavior in terms of barrier                  
              height and homogeneity.  From an application point of view,                    
              understanding these properties is helpful to semiconductor device              
              design and fabrication.  The results will be of importance in a                
              general way to the technology of large scale, high speed                       
              integrated electronic circuits.
