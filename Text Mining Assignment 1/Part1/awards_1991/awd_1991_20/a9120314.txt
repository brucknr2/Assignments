Abstract    :
              In 1986 pond construction on the Burnham farm, located in                      
              northwestern Oklahoma, uncovered three buried alluvial deposits                
              which contained large numbers of faunal remains.  These included               
              a large-horned bison skull which resembled Bison latifrons a                   
              species believed to be present more than 20,000 years ago.                     
              Excavation by Dr. Wyckoff and his colleagues revealed the                      
              presence of small shattered stone flakes in association with the               
              bison and subsequent radiocarbon determinations have suggested a               
              date of between 26,000 -31,000 years ago.  If this, in fact, is                
              an archaeological site, it documents the presence of humans in                 
              the New World well before the accepted date of ca. 12,000 years.               
              Dr. Wyckoff has spent several seasons excavating the Burnham site              
              but has not conclusively demonstrated that the materials are                   
              associated either with each other or an early date.  The problem               
              is that both stone and bone are in a derived context and have                  
              been carried into the area.  With National Science Foundation                  
              support, he will conduct the necessary geological work to answer               
              this question.  Mechanical equipment will be used to cut trenches              
              to clarify the stratigraphy.  Relevant areas with then be cleared              
              and careful hand excavation conducted.  It is hoped that cultural              
              materials in primary context and clear stratigraphic position                  
              will be found.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Archaeologists agree that humans entered the New World from Asia               
              and that by 12,000 years ago they were widely distributed.                     
              However, it is unclear how much before this time original                      
              migration took place.  Some argue for much earlier dates while                 
              the majority believe that the archaeological evidence for this is              
              unconvincing.  The Burnham site is important within this context               
              and the work which Dr. Wyckoff will conduct should help to                     
              resolve this issue.
