Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Acoustic signals are important in understanding how members of the             
              same species communicate with each other. Juveniles learn speech               
              by listening to mature members of their species, and go through an             
              initial phase of babbling before perfecting this behavior. Human               
              speech and avian song have many similarities which allow bird song             
              to be used as a model system for understanding the way in which the            
              brain regulates communicaton behavior. An important component of               
              communication is the ability to recognize signals produced by                  
              members of the same species, called conspecifics. In female birds,             
              such recognition is essential in insuring that they mate only with             
              conspecific males. This award to Dr. Eliot Brenowitz will                      
              investigate how females perceive song and the manner in which brain            
              regions control recognition of mating songs produced by conspecific            
              males. Selective inactivation of one brain region, the high vocal              
              center, causes female birds to fail to distinguish between male                
              canary song and the songs of males of other species. To determine              
              if there is a pathway in the brain that is specialized for song                
              recognition, brain regions connected to the high vocal center will             
              be inactivated. The effects of such inactivation will be measured              
              with a behavioral display performed by breeding females in response            
              to presentation of songs sung by conspecific males. Specific                   
              elements of the song will be tested to determine which signals are             
              most important. Additionally, each side of the brain will be testd             
              separately to determine if the system is bilaterally asymmetrical              
              as is the case for human speech. This work will contribute to                  
              understanding the way in which the brain controls recognition of               
              signals critical for successful communication.
