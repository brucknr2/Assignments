Abstract    :
              This is a travel award for an exploratory visit to the University              
              of Florida to visit faculty and examine facilities, to the Basel               
              Institute for Immunology, and to attend the Annual Meeting of the              
              American Ornithologists Union.  Initial contacts have been made                
              with Dr. Edward Wakeland at Florida, Jim Kaufman at the Basel                  
              Institute, and several of the attendees at the ornithology                     
              meeting, all of whom have expressed an interest in serving as                  
              postdoctoral mentor.  Initial discussions of possible                          
              arrangements for a postdoctoral appointment will also be held.
