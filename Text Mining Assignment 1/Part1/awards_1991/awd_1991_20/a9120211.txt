Abstract    :
              This group of investigators from the University of California at               
              Santa Barbara proposed to purchase an "Iris Crimson Elan"                      
              computer for the purpose of DNA and protein sequence analysis and              
              molecular graphics.  The investigators use recombinant DNA                     
              techniques in their research.  Nearly 20 individual labs will use              
              the computer.  The labs will be linked by an ethernet system                   
              currently being installed by the institution.  Research projects               
              using the system include a wide range of studies involving both                
              plant and animal cells.
