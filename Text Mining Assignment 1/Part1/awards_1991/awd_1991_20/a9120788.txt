Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the applicability of a lexical-                
              based framework to the problem of interlingual machine                         
              translation.  There are two tasks relevant to this goal.  The                  
              first task is the augmentation of an existing lexical-semantic                 
              representation to include temporal, aspectual, and spatial                     
              information, all of which are necessary for adequate machine                   
              translation.  The second task is the construction of routines for              
              automatic acquisition of lexical entries based on this                         
              representation.  In general, the project aims to test hypotheses               
              that support the view that a lexical-based parametric framework                
              can be built to accommodate interlingual machine translation, and              
              provide and adequate basis for capturing temporal, aspectual, and              
              spatial information.
