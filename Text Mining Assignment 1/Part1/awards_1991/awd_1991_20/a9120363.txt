Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research directed toward improved understanding of                 
              growth and processing of semiconductors, and the electronic                    
              properties of heterostructures through the development and use of              
              advanced contactless electromodulation methods of photore-                     
              flectance and electroreflectance will be conducted.  A major                   
              advantage of these methods is that they can be used in situ and                
              in real time for effective improvement in the control of advanced              
              semiconductor growth and subsequent processing as well as                      
              providing fundamental information on the basic electronic                      
              properties of these materials. The research base established will              
              serve to improve materials parameters such as alloy composition,               
              Schottky barrier heights, interfacial quality, well width in                   
              quantum well structures and superlattices.

              This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental                        
              understanding of semiconductor growth and processing, and the                  
              fundamental electronic properties of heterostructures.  From an                
              application point of view, understanding these processes and                   
              properties is beneficial to semiconductor device design and                    
              fabrication.  The results will be of importance in a general way               
              to the technology of large scale, high speed integrated                        
              electronic circuits.
