Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During development of the nervous system, newly generated cells                
              must extend processes over substantial distances to establish                  
              contacts with their correct target cells.  A central issue in                  
              developmental neurobiology is to understand how these processes                
              navigate accurately through the embryo.  At the tips of extending              
              processes are growth cones that detect guidance information and, on            
              the basis of this information, orient the direction of process                 
              extension.  A unique culture system of the exposed grasshopper                 
              embryo limb in combination with  high-tech imaging will be used to             
              visualize the growth cones of growing neurons and study molecular              
              mechansims involved in growth cone steering.  Specifically, the                
              role of actin molecules in growth cone steering will be                        
              investigated through the use of fluorescent probes and laser                   
              photobleaching techniques.  Experimental manipulation of actin in              
              situ will shed light on the relationships of actin to other                    
              cytoskeletal components and cell-substrate interactions.
