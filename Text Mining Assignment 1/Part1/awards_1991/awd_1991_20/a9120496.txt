Abstract    :
                   This action will provide funds for continual research by                  
              three faculty, one research associate and two students.  The                   
              main activity will be toward the completion of the new                         
              particle detector being built for use at the Stanford Linear                   
              Collider at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.  This                      
              group has been part of a large collaboration to develop and                    
              build the detector.  The detector will be used to accumulate a                 
              sample of events resulting from the collisions of polarized                    
              electronics and positrons.  The analysis of the events is                      
              expected to be a sensitive test of the "standard model" of the                 
              elementary particles.                                                          
                   Other activities will include the completion of the                       
              analysis of neutrino interactions in a bubble chamber                          
              (Fermilab experiment E632) and exploration of new experiments                  
              perhaps to be performed on a machine to collide electrons and                  
              positrons, being planned for construction in Seville, Spain.
