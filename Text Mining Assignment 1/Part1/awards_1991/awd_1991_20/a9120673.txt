Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed research is the development of                   
              appropriate modeling capability to gain insight into the                       
              fundamental phenomena associated with the flow and transport                   
              in                                                                             
              systems with active interfacial regions as well as provide                     
              useful                                                                         
              design and operation data.  The capability to investigate the                  
              linear as well as weakly nonlinear stability of many such                      
              systems                                                                        
              to three-dimensional disturbances will be developed in                         
              general.                                                                       
              Specific systems will be investigated, the results compared to                 
                                                                                             
              existing experimental results, and some new experiments                        
              designed.
