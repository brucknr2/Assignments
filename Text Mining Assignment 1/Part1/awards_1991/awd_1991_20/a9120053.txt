Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds one of the leading young observers, a specialist              
              in spectropolarimetry, for studies of active galactic nuclei,                  
              quasars, and primeval galaxies.  A variety of observational                    
              techniques will be used to probe the hidden cores of active                    
              galaxies and to detect just forming primeval galaxies at very                  
              high redshift.  These efforts, if successful, will greatly extend              
              our understanding of the extreme conditions in the hearts of                   
              radio sources and in the very early universe.
