Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs will utilize techniques of nonlinear dynamics to                  
              characterize parameter spaces supporting various solutions.  This              
              will help to predict stable boundary layers.  Systems of ordinary              
              differential equations (ODE) will be used along with more complete             
              partial equation (PDE) descriptions of these systems.  The project             
              will analyze both the simpler ODE systems and the PDE systems.                 
              Multidimensional bifurcation and regime diagrams will be developed             
              to describe the role of various parameters in determining the                  
              solution regimes.
