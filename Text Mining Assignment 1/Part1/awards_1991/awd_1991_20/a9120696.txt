Abstract    :
              This is a travel award for exploratory visits to the Imperial                  
              College Center for Population Biology in England and to the                    
              Rockefeller University Laboratory of Populations to visit faculty              
              and examine facilities.  Initial contacts have been made with                  
              Professors John Lawton and Bob May at the Imperial College, and                
              with Professor Joel Cohen at Rockefeller Graham Walker, all of                 
              whom have expressed an interest in serving as postdoctoral mentor              
              for Mr. Martinez.  Travel is also planned to  present a paper at               
              the Annual Meeting of the Ecological Society of America, which                 
              will provide additional opportunities for contacts with potential              
              mentors.
