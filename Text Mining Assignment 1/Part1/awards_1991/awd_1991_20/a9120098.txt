Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at West Virginia                         
              University purchase an automated single-crystal diffractometer.                
              Among the areas of chemical research that will be enhanced are                 
              the following:  1) synthesis of new enediyne compounds,  2)                    
              synthesis and reactivity studies of stabilized metalla-                        
              cyclobutadienes and 3) model studies of hydroporphyrin                         
              containing enzymes.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful                      
              analytical method for structures determination of solids.  In                  
              synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic                  
              chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable                   
              tool to characterize molecular structure.  The information                     
              gained from the knowledge of the molecular composition and                     
              structure helps to develop new reactions of potentially general                
              interest in catalysis or synthesis.
