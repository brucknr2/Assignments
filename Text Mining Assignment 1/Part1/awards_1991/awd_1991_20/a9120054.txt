Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The current lack of commercially available Open Systems                        
              Interconnect (OSI) dynamic routing technology represents a major               
              impediment to the deployment of viable large-scale networks based              
              upon OSI.  This project will exploit the National Institute of                 
              Stnadards and Technology's (NIST) unique position within                       
              government and industry in a program of work that is vital to                  
              eliminiating this impediment.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks funding to provide partial support for the                 
              first 12 months of the program of work.  This program will                     
              establish a cooperative laboratory for OSI routing technology and              
              has mulitiple objectives:                                                      
                                                                                             
                   1. Establish a cooperative research program with                          
              participants from industry, academia, and government interested                
              in fostering conformant, interoperable OSI routing products;                   
                                                                                             
                   2. Provide an open testbed facility for OSI routing                       
              products;                                                                      
                                                                                             
                   3. Foster mature commercially available OSI routing                       
              products;                                                                      
                                                                                             
                   4. Research and develop methodologies and prototype tools to              
              support conformance testing, interoperability testing, and                     
              product level evaluation of OSI routing technology.***
