Abstract    :
                The goal of this research is to develop parallel   system solvers for
              symmetric indefinite and non-symmetric   systems such as those occurring in
              computational fluid   dynamics,  develop parallel techniques for solving
              time-dependent   problems, and  construct a rapid prototyping environment for
              developing and  experimenting with algorithms in sparse matrix computations  
              on shared  and distributed memory multiprocessors.  In particular, the   are
              examined:  (1) parallel solution schemes for solving Stokes-like linear  
              arising in CFD and other augmented Lagrangian problems such   interior point
              methods of linear programming,  (2) incomplete Newton methods with Krylov or
              row projection   solvers for the inner iteration,  (3) solution of
              time-dependent problems using high-order   methods in time,  (4) defining and
              developing sparse matrix primitives   analogous to the  highly effective
              BLAS-3's for dense computations, and  (5) implementing sparse factorization and
              solution schemes.  The goal is portable efficiency and scalability, by  
              parallelism on multiple levels.  This in turn allows the work   be used across
              a wide spectrum of existing and future   architectures, instead of simply a
              particular machine.
