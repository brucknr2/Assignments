Abstract    :
              In this project in Experimental Physical Chemistry, Professor                  
              Donald W. Setser of Kansas State University will study gas                     
              phase reactions involving well-defined quantum states of both                  
              reactant and product molecules. Laser excitation techniques                    
              permit selective excitation of reaction pathways along excited                 
              state potential surfaces. As a new initiative, transition                      
              metals reacting with halogens and with oxygen will be studied                  
              by flow reactor methods.                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              It is now possible to steer the course of chemical reactions by                
              using lasers to direct atoms and molecules to desired initial                  
              energy states. The work of Prof. Setser (Kansas State                          
              University) greatly advances the state of this technique,                      
              widening the scope of "steerable" reactions to include metals                  
              important in catalyis.
