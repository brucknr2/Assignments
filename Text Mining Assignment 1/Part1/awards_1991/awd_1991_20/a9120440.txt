Abstract    :
              The characteristics of most metal surfaces are known to display                
              strong deviations from the bulk.  The interlayer spacing, the                  
              periodicity of atoms in a layer, the localized vibrational modes,              
              and anisotropy and enhanced anharmonicity in the vibrational                   
              amplitudes are some attributes which may distinguish the surface               
              atoms from those in the bulk crystal.  The main objective of this              
              theoretical grant is to isolate the effects of surface                         
              anharmonicity on the structure and dynamics of several                         
              technologically and fundamentally important clean metals and metal-            
              on-metal systems.  The study will consist of computer simulations              
              using the molecular dynamics technique and interatomic potentials              
              from the embedded atom method.                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              The research will explore properties of metal surfaces and of                  
              metal-metal interfaces to distinguish the effects of surface                   
              anharmonicities on surface and bulk properties.  Close interaction             
              will be maintained with experimental groups.  The research results             
              will be of importance to many applications where metal surfaces are            
              important, i.e., electronics, corrosion, etc.
