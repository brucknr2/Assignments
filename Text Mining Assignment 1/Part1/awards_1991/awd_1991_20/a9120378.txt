Abstract    :
              This research investigates the functional behavior and VLSI                    
              realization of a novel, scalable and intelligent wafer-level                   
              communications network (the Silicon Wafer Area Network or SWAN)                
              supporting fine grained communications with predictable network                
              traversal times.  The network's "intelligence" is chosen to                    
              adaptively and dynamically establish virtual interconnections with             
              the functionality of direct point-to-point interconnections for                
              passage of individual messages through the network.  The network               
              is assumed to be a wafer-level function, allowing highly parallel              
              data links between switches by exploiting the high density of IC               
              wiring.  The network organization is similar to a systolic                     
              processing array, using nearest neighbor connections and pipelined             
              data movement through the network to establish high data rates.                
              The critical issue of load balancing is based on (1) achieving                 
              sufficiently high communications rate capabilities so that network             
              links are sparsely used (i.e. a rate capability well in excess of              
              the required data rates) and (2) a global routing and load                     
              balancing algorithm based on electrostatic and potential energies              
              (i.e. a network "activity potential").  The distributed                        
              computations of the potential energies provides each local node                
              with a slowly varying measure of link usage in regions away from               
              that node.  The specific research completes VLSI design and circuit            
              simulations of the performance of the network nodes.  In addition,             
              the research develops a network simulator to investigate the steady            
              state and transient behavior of the network with various routing               
              and load balancing algorithms selected to achieve the maximum VLSI             
              area/speed performance.
