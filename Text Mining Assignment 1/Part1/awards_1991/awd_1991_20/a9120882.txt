Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of this project is to initiate a program of                            
              paleontological and geological exploration in the Manonga Valley               
              of northern Tanzania in order to ascertain the potential of the                
              fossil sites in the area for the study of human evolution.  A                  
              preliminary reconnaissance by the principal investigator in 1990               
              demonstrated that the Manonga Valley which has been almost                     
              completely unexplored previously, is an area of tremendous                     
              potential for future paleoanthropological research.  The ancient               
              lake basin, with its extensive, well-exposed and fossil-rich                   
              sediments can now be considered one of the most significant                    
              paleontological research areas in eastern Africa.                              
                                                                                             
              Only a few isolated and fragmentary fossil remains of early human              
              ancestors are known from Africa prior to 4 million years ago.                  
              The estimated age of the sites in the Manonga Valley (3-6 million              
              years old), in conjunction with their paleontological                          
              productivity, and their close geographical proximity to other                  
              important sites that have yielded fossils pertinent to human                   
              evolution, makes the region of evident significance for the study              
              of human origins.  The major objectives of the project are: (1)                
              to make paleontological collections at the principal fossil                    
              localities and to continue to prospect for new sites; (2) to                   
              further assess the geological context and the age of the fossil                
              sites; and (3) to obtain data that will help to reconstruct the                
              paleoenvironmental setting of the ancient lake basin.
