Abstract    :
              This effort will enhance the recruitment and retention activities              
              on the part of Tennessee State University for minority and female              
              engineering students by increased recruitment in rural communities             
              and easing the transition from high school to college.  This effort            
              will entail the purchasing and outfitting of an "Engineering                   
              Laboratory on Wheel" and the enhancement of four existing                      
              engineering laboratories that are now being utilized by pre-college            
              participants and engineering freshmen.
