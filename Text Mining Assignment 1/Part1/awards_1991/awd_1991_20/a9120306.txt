Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will collect and analyze water samples for             
              concentration and distribution of radiocarbon (C-14) on                        
              hydrographic survey lines in the Pacific, as part of the World                 
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  Lines to be done in 1992 and             
              early 1993 will complete the coverage of the US contribution to                
              sampling in the South Pacific.  C-14 data will be incorporated                 
              with data on other transient tracers and hydrographic variables,               
              and with ocean general circulation models, to determine the large-             
              scale and long-term flow characteristics in the Pacific, with                  
              application to the role of the ocean in heat storage, heat                     
              transport, and the effects on climate variability.
