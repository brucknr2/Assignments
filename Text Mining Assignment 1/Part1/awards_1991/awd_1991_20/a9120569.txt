Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              A joint meeting of the European and American Associations for                  
              Experimental Social Psychology will be held prior to the meeting               
              of the 1992 International Congress of Psychology in Brussels.                  
              This meeting will provide an opportunity to bridge the gap                     
              between American and European views of social psychological                    
              phenomena and facilitate a fuller understanding of human social                
              behavior.  The meeting will encourage collaborative research and               
              scholarly communication between the two communities.
