Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Neuroglian, a molecule identified in the fruit fly, is a member of             
              the immunoglobulin superfamily which consists of a large number of             
              proteins that share a common repeated structure/functional domain:             
              the immunoglobulin-like domain.  Members of this family play                   
              important roles in cell recognition and cell adhesion in the                   
              developing brain and nervous system.  Although a large number of               
              immunoglobulin-like molecules have been characterized, the                     
              mechanisms of action of these molecules is not fully understood.               
              Molecular genetics, tissue culture, protein purification and X-ray             
              crystallography will by applied to define specific functional                  
              domains in the neuroglian molecule and to describe the structure of            
              these domains.  A complete analysis of the structure and function              
              of fruit fly neuroglian will advance our general understanding of              
              the mechanism of action of immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion                   
              molecules.  These studies relate not only to mechanisms underlying             
              nervous system development, but also to more general mechanisms                
              involved in cell adhesion and cell recognition in other tissues.
