Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Topp of the University of                
              Pennsylvania  will use picosecond-resolution polarization                      
              spectroscopy in cooled jet expansions to study structure and                   
              dynamics in molecular clusters.  Using the time-domain                         
              rotational coherence technique, Topp proposes to obtain                        
              structural information on clusters in order to understand                      
              energy transfer and related processes in these organized                       
              systems.  Such information is difficult to obtain by more                      
              normal frequency resolved spectroscopic techniques.  The                       
              aromatic molecule perylene will be used in much of the                         
              structural work, involving the complexation of different                       
              alkanes and various polar and unsaturated molecules with large                 
              electrostatic interactions.                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              The nucleation of small clusters of atoms or molecules by large                
              organic molecules which absorb and emit visible light presents                 
              valuable opportunities to study intermolecular forces of the                   
              kind found on a larger scale in solutions and in the adsorption                
              of molecules onto extended surfaces.  Lasers can be used to                    
              excite these large organic molecules, and then the time                        
              evolution of the associated cluster can be followed on very                    
              fast time scales in order to be able to determine the structure                
              and dynamics of these microscopic organized systems.  Such                     
              information can have a bearing on many fields, including                       
              catalysis and the chemistry of life processes.
