Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds to acquire equipment are awarded to enhance the present                  
              implementation of the UNIDATA Program at the University of Nevada-             
              Reno (UNR).  The Desert Research Institute (DRI) directs a program             
              in Atmospheric Physics at UNR.  Graduate and undergraduate teaching            
              activities take place both at UNR and the DRI Stead Science Center.            
              While the majority of the instruction takes place on the UNR                   
              campus, the use of computing facilities and real-time                          
              meteorological data has been limited to the Stead Location which is            
              located 10 km from the main campus.  This equipment award will                 
              provide the capability to capture, archival and access                         
              meteorological data to the Atmospheric Data Facility on the DRI                
              Stead campus and distribute these data via ethernet to a weather               
              laboratory on the main campus.
