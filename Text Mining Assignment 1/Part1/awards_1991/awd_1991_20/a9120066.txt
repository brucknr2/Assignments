Abstract    :
              Unique laser-based measurements in integrated optical                          
              structures will be used by Professor Bohn of the University of                 
              Illinois-Urbana to monitor the structure of monomolecular thin                 
              film assemblies, in this project supported by the Analytical                   
              and Surface Chemistry program.  The goal of this work is to                    
              provide a better description of the orientational distribution                 
              of molecular assemblies prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett                          
              deposition or by self-assembly methods.  Three experimental                    
              approaches will be developed.  First, fluorescence anisotropy                  
              and linear dichroism measurements will be applied to static                    
              monolayers at high sensitivity.  Second, the order of the                      
              assembly will be characterized under dc electric field                         
              perturbation.  Third, the dynamic response of the thin layer                   
              will be examined by monitoring optical response to variable                    
              frequency electric field perturbations.  The waveguide optical                 
              probe methods developed in this project provide a unique                       
              structural capability for characterizing order in these                        
              important molecular assemblies.

              Determination of the degree of order in monomolecular thin                     
              films is the goal of this research project supported by the                    
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry program.  A detailed                          
              understanding of the structure of these thin film materials is                 
              crucial to the design of improved bioactive sensors and trace                  
              separation methods, and may impact the development of improved                 
              corrosion coatings.
