Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this project is the continuation of                   
              research on the morphology and comparative anatomy of primate                  
              locomotion.  The investigators have a long history of                          
              investigating muscular activity in locomotion and attempting to                
              then interpret the fossil record in light of their findings.
