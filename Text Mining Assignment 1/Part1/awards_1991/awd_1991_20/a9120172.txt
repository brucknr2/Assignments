Abstract    :
              Wilkes University requests support from NSF for connection of its              
              campus network to PREPnet.  PREPnet is the midlevel network located            
              in the state of Pennsylvania.  PREPnet will provide operations                 
              management and information services and it will give Wilkes                    
              University connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million            
              bits per second) National Backbone network.  The University needs              
              greater functionality and network speed to be able to access                   
              supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being            
              able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty            
              research will benefit from the link.  This is also a unique                    
              opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational                   
              resources.
