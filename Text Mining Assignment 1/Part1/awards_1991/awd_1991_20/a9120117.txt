Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project entails the excavation and analysis of material                   
              contained in the Middle Stone Age (MSA) deposits of Die Kelders                
              Cave 1, on the southwestern coast of South Africa.  Previous                   
              excavations revealed substantial Later Stone Age (LSA) materials               
              overlaying a thick MSA deposit.  Some human teeth were found                   
              which are similar to those of modern southern African indigenes,               
              tentatively date at prior to 40,000 years before the present.  A               
              team of specialists will excavate the cave, and analyze the MSA                
              and the LSA material.  Given the depth and volume of the MSA                   
              deposit in this cave, the demonstrated richness of the deposits,               
              the excellent quality of boner preservation, and the substantial               
              amount that will be excavated, the potential is high that the                  
              site will yield new fossils that can help resolve the issue of                 
              modern human origins.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it can contribute important                 
              information to the possibility that modern humans lived in Africa              
              while more "primitive" Neanderthal contemporaries were living in               
              Europe and the Levant, and so help us trace the history of modern              
              humans.
