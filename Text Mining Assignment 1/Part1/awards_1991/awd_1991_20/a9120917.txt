Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During embryonic development of the peripheral nervous system,                 
              migrating neurons and their advancing growth cones must traverse               
              and penetrate a variety of extracellular impediments to reach their            
              targets.  The secretion of proteases, including plasminogen                    
              activators, are thought to facilitate movement of neurons and their            
              growth cones by locally digesting impeding cell-cell and cell-                 
              matrix components.  To study this process, developmental changes in            
              the genetic expression of plasminogen activators will be studied in            
              mouse sensory ganglia in vivo and in cell culture.  Molecular                  
              probes will be used to study the type of cells synthesizing                    
              plasminogen activators as well as possible regulation of                       
              plasminogen activator expression by various growth factors.  The               
              role of plasminogen activators in axonal growth will be assessed by            
              blocking synthesis with antisense oligonucleotides.  These studies             
              are important not only for increasing our understanding of the                 
              mechanisms underlying normal neuronal development, but also those              
              that may play a role during regeneration of peripheral nerves in               
              the mammal.
