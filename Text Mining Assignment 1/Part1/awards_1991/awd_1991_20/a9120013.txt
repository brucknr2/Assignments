Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Funds are provided for the purchase of hardware and software              
              to install a local area network among the computers (a PS/2-70, two            
              PS/2-60's, a RISC 6000/320) that serve the Meteorology Program at              
              Plymouth State College.  Plymouth state is an active and innovative            
              participant in the UNIDATA program and this award will enable this             
              college to sustain and enhance their UNIDATA participation.  In                
              addition, the proposal seeks monies to network the computers                   
              serving the Meteorology Program to the PC cluster supporting the               
              Natural Science Department at Plymouth State.                                  
                   Networking has essentially become a necessary part of the                 
              UNIDATA Program.  The lack of a local area network has limited both            
              the educational and research value of UNIDATA at Plymouth State                
              even though UNIDATA terminals have been in place for over three                
              years.                                                                         
                   As a result of being networked, the Meteorology Program can be            
              enhanced significantly.  A UNIDATA computer laboratory will be                 
              taught on the PC's in the microcomputer cluster.  Current weather              
              graphics and satellite images will be integrated directly into                 
              course work by displaying them in meteorology classrooms and                   
              lecture halls.  The UNIDATA Campus Weather Display System will be              
              installed to give campus personnel and students direct access to               
              simple WXP and McIDAS graphics and forecasts.  Finally, a network              
              will provide an easy method of file transfer between the server                
              (RISC/6000) and the PS/2 machines, especially when McIDAS is                   
              officially released under the AIX operating system.
