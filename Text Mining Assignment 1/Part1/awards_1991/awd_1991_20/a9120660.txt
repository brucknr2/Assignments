Abstract    :
              Bacterial infections often accompany biomedical implants and                   
              indwelling catheters.  These infections are resistant to                       
              treatment and they persist and recur until removal of the                      
              prosthetic material.  The aim of this cross-disciplinary project               
              is to understand the pathophysiology of implant-device related                 
              infection, and to develop materials that are tailored to reduce                
              bacterial adhesion and are resistant to infections.  Cell-binding              
              protein studies will determine the role of preadsorbed proteins,               
              monoclonal antibodies and receptor-deficient mutants of the                    
              infectious agent on staphylococcal adhesion and neutrophil                     
              activation.  Novel polymers with different physicochemical                     
              properties will be synthesized in order to examine how these                   
              properties influence staphylococcal and neutrophil adhesion.                   
              These studies should aid the development of materials that are                 
              resistant to infection, leading to the safer use of implant                    
              devices for many surgical applications.
