Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to continue a program of research on quantum liquids            
              at ultralow temperatures.  Using a rotating submillikelvin                     
              refrigerator, experiments will be carried out on the dynamics of               
              liquid 3He.  In addition, one will study superfluidity in very thin            
              films of the liquid, and conduct a search for exotic                           
              superconductors in the mK region.
