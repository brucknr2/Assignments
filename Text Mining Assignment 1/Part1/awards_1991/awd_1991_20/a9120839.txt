Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent research indicates that the photoreceptors of the retina                
              are highly dependent upon the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).                
              The interface between the RPE and light receptors is a complex                 
              network of macromolecules, the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM).                
              The IPM surrounds the outer segments of the light receptors and                
              any nutrient or waste product must pass through it.  The IMP also              
              contains macromolecules necessary for retinal adhesion to the RPE              
              which prevent retinal detachment.  The primary objective of this               
              research is to analyze the organization and components of the IPM              
              in an unusual retina, the cone-dominant retina of the ground                   
              squirrel.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Undergraduate students will be trained in light- and electron-                 
              microscopic techniques as well as biochemical studies.  Because                
              of its high cone density, the ground squirrel retina can serve as              
              a model of the foveal area of primate and human retinas.  The IPM              
              domains associated with blue- and green-sensitive cones will be                
              analyzed for their anatomical and biochemical differences in an                
              effort to determine which features they share with other mammals               
              and which may be unique to the ground squirrel retina, itself.                 
              Insights gained from these studies will supplement studies of the              
              primate retina and fovea and should prove relevant to the human                
              retina.
