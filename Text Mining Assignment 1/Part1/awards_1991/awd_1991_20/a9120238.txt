Abstract    :
              The extraordinary resistance of bacterial spores, the diversity of             
              sporeforming species, and the importance (good and bad) of                     
              sporeformers to medicine, to food processing and to agriculture                
              were major stimuli for early research on spore formation.                      
              Increasingly, spore formation has been seen and studied as a                   
              primitive form of cell differentiation.  The emphasis of the                   
              present conference is regulation of expression of genes that                   
              control sporulation.  The program is designed to convey a picture              
              of the whole process of differentiation for a vegetative bacterium             
              into a spore, and to relate spore formation to other post-                     
              exponential stress responses.  One session will be devoted to the              
              related process of vegetative cell division.  The conference which             
              will convene in Woods Hole, Massachusetts on May 9-13, 1992, will              
              bring together leading scientists from around the world, and will              
              highlight exciting recent developments.  The formats of the                    
              conference is designed to maximize interaction among participants.
