Abstract    :
                   The U. S. Patent and Trademark Office will provide data to                
              extend and expand data series concerning patenting in the United               
              States. Data will include numbers of patents granted year by year              
              to Americans and to citizens of other specified countries,                     
              patents owned by individuals as opposed to private corporate                   
              entities, governments, and patents assigned to universities and                
              colleges.  Counts of granted patents will be classified by both                
              the Patent Office Classification system and the Standard                       
              Industrial Classification system.                                              
                   These data are used in the National Science Board's series                
              of Science and Engineering Indicators reports as indicators of                 
              levels of technical invention in the various countries, sectors,               
              and fields.
