Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be done on the structures, excitations               
              and thermal properties of physically adsorbed layers on solid                  
              surfaces.  Modulated monolayer lattices have domain wall structures            
              with many similarities to structures which occur in the surface                
              reconstructions of metals and semiconductors.  The domain wall                 
              excitations also have analogies to these systems.  Results are used            
              for statistical mechanical evaluation of thermal properties.  These            
              phenomena depend on, and provide measures of, the energetic                    
              topography of the substrate surface.  The substrates treated                   
              include: the (111) faces of platinum, palladium, copper, and                   
              silver, and the (001) face of magnesium oxide.  The primary                    
              adsorbates are the inert gas series, helium to xenon.  Combinations            
              are chosen which display features present also in more complex                 
              systems; quantitative atomic scale models are available or can be              
              constructed by extension of previous work.  The work has ties to               
              experiments with x-ray diffraction, thermal neutron scattering,                
              thermal helium scattering, ellipsometry, and microbalances.                    
              Theoretical study of the methods for analysing inelastic neutron               
              scattering from commensurate monolayers will also be undertaken.               
              The techniques in this work include lattice dynamical analysis,                
              continuum elasticity theory and variational quantum mechanics.
