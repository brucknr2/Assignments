Abstract    :
              Poly-B-hydroxyalkanoates (PHA's), polymers found in many bacteria,             
              have attracted considerable interest in recent years because they              
              exhibit biodegradable thermoplastic properties.  The physical                  
              properties of PHA polymers are dictated by the number of carbons in            
              their monomeric unit.  For instance, poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate                 
              (PHB= C4 monomeric unit) is much more flexible.  For this reason,              
              there is considerable ongoing research in the development of the               
              PHB/V copolymer.  The bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus is one of the            
              first bacteria shown to be capable of producing either PHB or                  
              PHB/V, depending on the feedstock.  The genes for polymer synthesis            
              in A. euthrophus have been cloned into Escherichia coli by our                 
              research group  where we have employed them to produce large                   
              intracellular deposits of PHB.  In initial experiments using                   
              standard E. coli strains we have not been able to detect copolymer             
              synthesis, even when the feedstock is altered to stimulate PHB/V               
              synthesis.  However, recently we were able to obtain copolymer                 
              synthesis employing an E. coli mutant.  Preliminary results                    
              indicate that copolymer synthesis in E. coli is similar to that                
              found in A. eutrophus.  The purpose of this research is to further             
              develop our knowledge of PHB/V synthesis and PHB/V genetics using              
              the newly develop E. coli system.  This research will be done by               
              conducting a comprehensive survey of bacteria that produce                     
              primarily PHB and PHB/V, cloning of selected PHB/V genetic                     
              pathways, analysis of these pathways in E. coli capable of PHV                 
              production, and manipulation of copolymer synthesis and structure              
              using genetic techniques.
