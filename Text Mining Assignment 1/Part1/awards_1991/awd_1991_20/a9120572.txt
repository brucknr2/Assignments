Abstract    :
              This award supports visits over a three year period by Dr. David               
              Bodznick of Wesleyan University and Dr. Mark Nelson from the                   
              University of Illinois to the laboratories of New Zealand                      
              colleagues Dr. John Charles Montgomery at the University of                    
              Auckland and Dr. Michael Geoffrey Paulin of the University of                  
              Otayo.  The Dorsal Octavolateral Nucleus (DON) is the structure                
              located in the medulla of elasmobranch fishes which filters                    
              electrosensory signals as they enter the brain.  In this project               
              advanced signal processing and computer simulation techniques                  
              will be used to characterize and analyze the function of the DON               
              in terms of detailed circuity.  By combining the skills and                    
              resources of the four investigators with diverse backgrounds the               
              study anticipates improving the understanding of the DON and                   
              similar brain structures in other vertebrates, and also how                    
              mathematical and computer methods can be applied to analyze                    
              neural structures.  The expertise of Dr. Paulin (mathematician)                
              in computer modelling in neurophysiology and Dr. Nelson (physics)              
              in biophysics and neural information processing will be                        
              integrated with the ongoing collaborative studies previously                   
              initiated by Drs. Bodznick and Montgomery in electrosensory                    
              systems and elasmobranch physiology.
