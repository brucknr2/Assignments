Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              There is now quite a bit of evidence for the general thesis that               
              our perceptual apparatus leaves its mark on the ways that we                   
              human beings think and talk about colors.  But much remains to be              
              said about the detailed nature of the connections between color                
              perception and color categorization, and it is not at all clear                
              just which questions about cross-culture regularities in the use               
              of basic color terms can be usefully addressed by the methods of               
              visual science and psychophysics.  The problem area needs                      
              competent collaborative work between anthropologists and                       
              linguists on the one hand, and psychologists and visual                        
              scientists on the other.  This end will be well served by                      
              convening, for the first time, a cross-disciplinary working                    
              conference on color categorization in thought and language, and                
              its biological underpinnings.  The conference will bring six or                
              seven cognitive and linguistic anthropologists together with an                
              equal number of psychologists and visual scientists and half a                 
              dozen junior investigators for three days of tutorials and                     
              intensive discussion of problem areas.  The proceedings of the                 
              conference will be transcribed, carefully edited, and published.
