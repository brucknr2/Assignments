Abstract    :
              This study addresses two aspects of the mechanism of carbon                    
              oxidation reactions:  the role of surface diffusion and the                    
              nature of the "strong sites" on carbon.  Diffusion of oxygen                   
              across the surface is studied using an argon-flush experiment                  
              in which the continued growth after reaction of monolayer etch                 
              pits on the basal plane of graphite is measured in an inert                    
              atmosphere.  The second topic is investigated with high-                       
              temperature (1000-1500C) temperature-programmed desorption of                 
              surface oxygen complexes; exploratory experiments show                         
              significant amounts of carbon monoxide desorb in this range.                   
              In addition, monolayer channeling and monolayer edge recession                 
              studies will be extended to carbon/carbon dioxide and                          
              carbon/water reactions catalyzed by alkali and alkaline earth                  
              catalysts; experimental techniques include gold-decoration                     
              transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis,                  
              and spectroscopic analysis.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Oxidation of carbon is one of the most important processes                     
              underlying civilization and is also one of the least                           
              understood.  It is a classical fundamental problem involving                   
              gas-solid kinetics, catalysis, diffusion, morphology, and heat                 
              transfer.  It is also of practical importance for combustion,                  
              synthetic fuels, and particulate control.
