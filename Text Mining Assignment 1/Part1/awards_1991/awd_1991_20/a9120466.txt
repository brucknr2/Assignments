Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              This project will examine the realtionship between language and                
              rank on the island of Pohnepi in Micronesia, to discover how                   
              social hierarchies are reflected in and at the same time                       
              reconstituted through language structure and use.  The study will              
              focus on the use of honorific forms, particularly during the                   
              daily ceremonial practice of kava preparation and consumption                  
              (kava is non-alcoholic, soporific beverage made from the pounded               
              root of the piper methysticum plant and water).  Although                      
              enthnographers have noted the importance of kava rituals                       
              throughout Oceania and their role in sustaining structures of                  
              prestige, very little is known about the use of language in these              
              contexts.  Preliminary investigation by the doctoral student has               
              shown kava settings to be particularly rich in the range of                    
              participants and linguistic choices.                                           
                   Through the observation and video-recording of spontaneous                
              kava events, this study will investigate: a) how honorific forms               
              are actually used by Pohnpeians in daily practice and how the                  
              presence of honorific words affects other aspects of the                       
              language, b) the relationship between lexical choices and the                  
              exploitation of the social space in which verbal interaction take              
              place, and c) the range of competence in honorific use across                  
              generations and how such competence is acquired.
