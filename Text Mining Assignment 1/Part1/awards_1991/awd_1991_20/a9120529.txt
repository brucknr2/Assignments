Abstract    :
              An exploratory evaluation will be made of the potential of                     
              C60 and C70 to serve as boundary lubricants on magnetic thin                   
              film disks.  These minute hollow molecules are known to be                     
              very deformable and may possibly serve as load carrying                        
              rollers for extremely smooth surfaces.  The tests will                         
              consist of measuring friction, and its change with time,                       
              between a regular ceramic magnetic head slider and magnetic                    
              disks on which various amounts of C60 have been deposited.                     
              The effects of moisture and gaseous environment will also be                   
              evaluated.
