Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A very high resolution (R = 1.2 x 105) mid-infrared spectrograph               
              for astronomical observations is proposed.  The spectrograph will              
              be a liquid helium cooled, double-pass, echelle using a 40 cm long             
              grating.  It will be able to resolve lines with 2.5 km s-1 Doppler             
              width and will have a noise-equivalent line flux of ~ 4 x 10-14 erg            
              s-1 cm-2 (1. in 1 second), allowing high signal-to-noise observations          
              of many young stars embedded in molecular clouds.  The instrument              
              will be used primarily for studies of interstellar molecules.  Very            
              high resolution and high sensitivity observations are necessary for            
              infrared observations of molecular clouds, especially the regions              
              around young stars.
