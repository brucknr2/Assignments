Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA receptor) is a protein              
              which helps regulate communications between nerve cells in the                 
              brain and spinal cord by regulating the movement of ions across the            
              nerve cell membranes and controlling excitability of nerve cells.              
              To understand how this receptor functions it is essential to know              
              its three-dimensional structure.  This can be determined with the              
              use of the electron microscope.  To learn the number of subunits               
              which combine to form the GABA receptor structure and should give              
              us additional insights into how the GABA receptor is able to                   
              regulate neuronal communication.  Also, identifying the sites on               
              the GABA receptor where benzodiazepines and GABA bind, using                   
              chemical labeling methods,  will lead to an understanding of the               
              function of the receptor in nervous system function and behavior.
