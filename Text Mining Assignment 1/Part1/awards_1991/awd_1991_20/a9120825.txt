Abstract    :
              This is a grant for travel support for a workshop to                           
              bring together the information storage and                                     
              microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)                                          
              communities, to explore applications of MEMS to                                
              enhance information storage technologies.  Support                             
              is provided to enable about ten academic researchers                           
              to attend this workshop.
