Abstract    :
                   This proposal focuses on interactions between ponderosa                   
              pine and four species that feed upon it. These include the Abert               
              squirrel, the porcupine, the dwarf-mistletoe and the bark beetle.              
              All four species feed on pine phloem, thereby causing severe loss              
              of vigor and mortality in this pine.  We test the hypothesis that              
              each species selects different ponderosa pine phenotypes.                      
              Results will provide a clearer understanding of the complex                    
              consequences of multi-species interactions natural communities.                
              In addition, they will allow forest managers throughout the                    
              western USA to better protect  these commercially important                    
              forests from damage by these species.
