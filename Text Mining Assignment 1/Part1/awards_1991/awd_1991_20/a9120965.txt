Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent developments in the study of nonlinear systems have shown               
              that simple theoretical models are capable of extremely                        
              complicated dynamics that cannot be predicted over the long term               
              but that are nonetheless deterministic.  The dynamics of such                  
              systems are "chaotic," rather than random.                                     
                                                                                             
              The emergence of the behavior of a social unit from the actions                
              of the individuals that comprise it is one of the central                      
              problems in the study of behavior.  Dr. Cole is studying how the               
              patterns of movement activity of ant colonies are derived from                 
              the actions of individuals.  Individual worker ants appear to                  
              have chaotic activity patterns, spontaneously becoming active and              
              reverting to inactivity.  Colonies go through periodic episodes                
              of activity about every 30 minutes.  The transition from the                   
              chaotic dynamics of individual workers to the periodic dynamics                
              of colonies provides an opportunity to study the mechanisms by                 
              which a social phenotype is produced.  Furthermore, the fact that              
              the activity of an individual is chaotic, and therefore                        
              deterministic, suggests that short-term predictions can be made                
              about the activity of workers.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Comparing the actual activity of ants and computer models of                   
              chaotic systems, Dr. Cole will study the transition from chaos to              
              periodicity in two situations:  first, in artificial aggregates                
              of workers constructed from mature colonies, and second, during                
              the pattern of normal colony growth as the colony passes from a                
              single individual (the queen) to a mature colony with many                     
              workers.
