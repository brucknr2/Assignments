Abstract    :
              The project deals with the optical determination of chemical                   
              composition and chemical reactions of a single,                                
              electrodynamically  levitated aerosol particle.  Raman and                     
              fluorescence spectroscopic techniques will be developed for                    
              this purpose.  Physical and chemical phenomena around a single                 
              particle will be controlled and measured with especially                       
              conceived methods.  The effect of the enhanced electrical                      
              field near the particle surface will be considered in the                      
              spectroscopic methods.  By using particles with different                      
              (unreactive and reactive) cores and surface layers, it is                      
              possible to separate the particle core and surface effects.  A                 
              new technique is proposed to study microparticle chemistry at                  
              elevated temperatures using laser heating.                                     
                                                                                             
              The project will advance the Raman spectroscopy and                            
              fluorescence spectroscopy applied to ultrafine particles.  The                 
              results will be useful for basic understanding of phenomena                    
              taking place at the scale of a single aerosol particle, and                    
              has applications in pollution control, material synthesis by                   
              aerosol processes, pharmaceutical and other industries.
