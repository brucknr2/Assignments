Abstract    :
              This collaboration between Martin Flower, University of Illinois,              
              Chicago, and Xie Guanghong, Chinese Academy of Sciences'                       
              Institute of Geochemistry, is a joint geochemical study of                     
              xenoliths and mineral separates from southern and eastern China.               
              Results of this study will be used to evaluate aspects of the                  
              sub-continental mantle lithosphere, and will provide important                 
              data previously not available.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Questions being addressed in this research are important for                   
              understanding formation of the lithosphere and its evolution over              
              geologic time.  Collaboration with Chinese scientists will                     
              provide access to remote, previously unsampled sites and use of                
              Chinese laboratories.  The project will also support the                       
              participation of an American graduate student.
