Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Science and Technology Center for Superconductivity undertakes             
              to understand the materials, the phenomenon, and possible                      
              applications of high temperature superconductivity by bringing                 
              together human resources and facilities from four institutions with            
              strong capabilities in both superconductivity and materials                    
              research: the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,                      
              Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, and Argonne                
              National Laboratory.  Center chemists, physicists, materials                   
              scientists, and engineers, including theorists and                             
              experimentalists, collaborate to design and carry forward an                   
              integrated research and education program.  The mission of Center              
              research is to establish the character and origin of the                       
              superconducting state and its dependence on materials properties,              
              thereby establishing a knowledge base for applications.  Through               
              workshops, collaborations, and visitor programs, the benefits of               
              the Center are extended to colleagues in industry and in other                 
              universities and national laboratories.  The Center for                        
              Superconductivity is directed by Professor Miles V. Klein.
