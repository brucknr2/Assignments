Abstract    :
                   Studies of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation have helped to               
              clarify phylogenetic relationships in many plant groups.  However,             
              the most common types of cpDNA data cannot be applied to parasitic             
              plant lineages that are completely non-photosynthetic.  I propose              
              to use a new source of data, sequences of nonphotosynthetic                    
              chloroplast genes, to investigate phylogenetic relationships in a              
              family containing photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic forms.                  
              Scrophulariaceae and Orobanchaceae are ideal for these studies                 
              because they contain plants with a wide range of parasitic                     
              behaviors, including some that are highly destructive to important             
              crop plants.  Additionally, plants in this group display                       
              remarkable variation in cpDNA structure and gene content associated            
              with the loss of photosynthesis.                                               
                   A multiple approach involving gene sequencing and cpDNA                   
              mapping will examine the molecular phylogeny of this group and                 
              fully describe its variation in cpDNA structure and gene content.              
              The study will focus on critical "transition" genera that unify the            
              Scrophulariaceae with the (nonphotosynthetic) Orobanchaceae, but               
              will include species in both groups plus outgroup taxa.                        
                   Significant developments that should derive from this research            
              include: (1) Efficient molecular systematic approaches that can be             
              used within plant families, even "troublesome" ones that include               
              nonphotosynthetic plants.  (2) Opportunities to learn much about               
              the phylogenetic relationships and character evolution within the              
              most economically important group of parasitic plants. (3) A much              
              deeper understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms of cpDNA                   
              molecular variation.
