Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Steroid hormones profoundly influence the structure and function               
              of the central nervous system during development and throughout                
              the vertebrates' lifespan.  While the major source of                          
              testosterone and estradiol comes from the gonads, the brain also               
              produces steroids.  Aromatase enzymes responsible for the                      
              metabolism of androgen into estrogen are localized within                      
              specific target neurons in discrete brain regions, such as the                 
              hypothalamus.  In some species of vertebrates, aromatase is not                
              found in testes or adrenals.  Dr. Schlinger will determine                     
              whether the major source of circulating estrogen in these males                
              is derived from aromatization of androgens in the brain.  This                 
              has important theoretical ramifications because the brain may not              
              only be a target of steroid hormones but also a major source of a              
              circulating steroid.  He will also examine the role of brain                   
              estrogen synthesis in the regulations of sex differences in brain              
              development and function.  To accomplish these goals, Dr.                      
              Schlinger will measure the amount of estrogen recovered in                     
              discrete brain regions, non-neural tissues and the vascular                    
              system following injection of androgen.  He will then identify                 
              the source of the androgen substrate for the brain to produce                  
              estrogen.  Finally, Dr. Schlinger will quantify the activity of                
              aromatase enzymes and define their subcellular localization                    
              within neurons of the hypothalamus.  These studies will lead to                
              new insights in the mechanisms underlying hormone-brain                        
              interactions.  Increasing our knowledge about the basic processes              
              underlying normal neuroendocrine events will contribute towards                
              to a better understanding of birth defects that result from                    
              insufficient and/or excessive exposure to a particular steroid                 
              hormone.
