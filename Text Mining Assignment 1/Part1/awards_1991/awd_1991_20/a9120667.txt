Abstract    :
              This project, which is supported under the Small Grant for                     
              Exploratory Research (SGER) program, will trace the development and            
              transport of the stratospheric aerosol clouds that were injected by            
              the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruptions.  The measurements will be made            
              by balloon borne sondes at various latitudes until the cloud                   
              reaches polar regions (approximately 1 year).  The measurements                
              will determine the distribution of the clouds and measure their                
              vertical profiles as well as the size and shape of the constituent             
              particles.  Of particular importance will be to what extent the                
              cloud is trapped within (or excluded from) the next polar winter               
              vortices, since it is known that stratospheric aerosols play an                
              important role in the destruction of polar ozone.  Particular                  
              attention will be paid to the hemispheric differences.                         
                                                                                             
              This project is jointly funded by the Division of Polar Programs               
              and Division of Atmospheric Sciences.
