Abstract    :
                   The investigator and his colleagues continue their study and              
              development of highly accurate finite element methods for                      
              computing solutions of partial differential equations.  They have              
              shown in previous work that high degree methods, such as the h-p               
              version of the finite element method, are very effective.                      
              Recently these methods have been implemented in various                        
              engineering programs (inclusive of commercial).  The research                  
              will concentrate on mathematical and numerical problems leading                
              to the reliable solution of problems of solid mechanics with                   
              important applications in engineering, such as fractures in 3-                 
              dimensional bodies, modelling of plates and shells, etc.                       
                   The goal of the research is to establish mathematical                     
              results that will be used in the computer analysis of engineering              
              problems.  These results will allow to be developed highly                     
              effective computational methods for broad applications in                      
              research and commercial computer codes that are widely used in                 
              engineering science and practice.
