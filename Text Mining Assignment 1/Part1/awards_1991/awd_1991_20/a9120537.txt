Abstract    :
                   This grant will provide continued support for research on                 
              the D0 Experiment (E740) at Fermilab.  D0 is an all-purpose                    
              particle detector.                                                             
                   The research will include the first data run of the D0                    
              Experiment starting in early 1992 along with efforts to extract                
              competitive physics results from these data.  Searches will be                 
              made for the top quark and other new phenomena such as                         
              super-symmetric particles.  Tests of quantum chromodynamics and                
              measurements of W/Z boson properties will be carried out.                      
                   The research will also include some work on upgrading the D0              
              Detector so that it will be able to handle the increased                       
              luminosity to be provided by Fermilab's Main Injector and extend               
              the physics reach of the experiment.
