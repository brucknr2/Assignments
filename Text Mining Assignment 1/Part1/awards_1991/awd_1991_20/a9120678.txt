Abstract    :
              A unified education curriculum will be initiated at the Freshman               
              level in the College of Engineering and Architecture at Prairie                
              View A&M University.  Four courses will be integrated into a two               
              semester course sequence emphasizing creativity and                            
              conceptualization in the preparation of the engineering students.              
              If successful, the results will attract and motivate students to               
              remain in engineering.
