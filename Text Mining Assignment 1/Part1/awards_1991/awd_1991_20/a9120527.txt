Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is, based on our initial                             
              success, to continue investigating and developing                              
              ultra-high speed metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM)                               
              photodetectors that have a sub-100nm finger                                    
              spacing and finger width, operate with a sub-                                  
              picosecond response time and a tera-hertz cut-off                              
              frequency, and can detect a broad range of                                     
              wavelengths from visible to infrared.  The proposed                            
              research will focus on the following four aspects:                             
              (1) Fabricate tera-hertz MSM photodetectors with                               
              sub-100nm finger spacing and finger width using                                
              ulta-high resolution electron beam lithography,                                
              initially on GaAs, and later InGaAs,InGaP,SOI (Si                              
              on insulator), and Si-Ge for different response                                
              wavelengths.  (2) Investigate experimentally and                               
              theoretically the factors that can increase the                                
              detectors' speed and sensitivity.  (3) Investigate the                         
              dynamic performance of the MSM photodetectors                                  
              using femto-second pulsed lasers.  And (4) use the                             
              ulta-high speed MSM detectors as a vehicle to study                            
              ballistic transport of electrons and holes between a                           
              sub-100nm finger spacing and in a high electric                                
              field, particularly carrier velocity overshoots, and                           
              explore their application on improvement of                                    
              detectors' speed.
