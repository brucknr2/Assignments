Abstract    :
              The behavior of nanoelectronic devices is                                      
              strongly influenced by quantum effects;                                        
              switching may be triggered by the transit of                                   
              just several electrons in a conduction channel;                                
              and structures may be so closely packed in a                                   
              circuit that not only device-device interactions                               
              are not negligible, but could even be exploited                                
              to create new functions.                                                       
              The simulation of quantum and optical                                          
              features of these novel devices is quite                                       
              challenging, because of the difficulty in                                      
              formulating and numerically implementing                                       
              manageable physical models.  In this                                           
              interdisciplinary proposal the computational                                   
              problems that require expertise in engineering,                                
              physics, computer science and applied                                          
              mathematics will be addressed. The large scale                                 
              numerical algorithms are optimized and                                         
              implemented efficiently on supercomputers.                                     
              The 2-D software developed under previous                                      
              grant period for the analysis of quantum wire                                  
              structures will be extended into an engineering                                
              tool with user friendly interface.  A full                                     
              extension of the self-consistent solver for the                                
              coupled Schrodinger and Poisson equations to                                   
              three-dimensions will be carried out.  Finally,                                
              advanced graphics techniques for multi-                                        
              dimensional data representation will be                                        
              developed employing animation and
