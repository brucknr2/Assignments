Abstract    :
              In this proposal we discuss algorithms for solving                             
              high-order numerical problems that arise in the                                
              design of control laws for systems modeled with                                
              large numbers of variables (parameters, inputs,                                
              outputs, states, etc.).  Particular attention is focused                       
              on certain key matrix equations arising in state-                              
              space-based control engineering.  The most                                     
              common such equations are Lyapunov and Riccati                                 
              equations, and their effective numerical solution is                           
              described in detail, although our techniques also                              
              apply more generally.  Considerable discussion is                              
              focused on large-scale matrix problems, including                              
              those in which the matrices are sparse or                                      
              structured.  In addition to continuing our research                            
              on algorithms for implementation on vector                                     
              supercomputers such as the Cray Y-MP for which                                 
              coarse-grained parallelism can also be exploited,                              
              we proposing now to extend our efforts to                                      
              computers such as the Connection Machine with                                  
              massive parallelism.  Much of our proposed                                     
              research is intended to lay the groundwork for the                             
              next generation of computer-aided control system                               
              design and analysis software.
