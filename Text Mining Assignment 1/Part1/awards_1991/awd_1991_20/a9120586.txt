Abstract    :
                   Marion Jenkinson is an adjunct curator of birds at the                    
              University of Kansas, and presently serves as Treasurer of the                 
              American Ornithologists' Union.  Dr. Jenkinson has organized a                 
              symposium entitled "Modernization of the Ornithological Collections            
              of Neotropical America", sponsored by the Collections Committee of             
              the American Ornithological Union.  The symposium is to be held in             
              conjunction with the Fourth Neotropical Ornithological Congress in             
              Quito, Ecuador, in November, 1991.  Collections in Latin America               
              were discussed at the Third Congress in 1987, and the proposed                 
              meeting will focus on the curatorial needs created by the recent               
              explosion of biodiversity survey and inventory projects in the                 
              Neotropics.                                                                    
                   This symposium affords an opportunity to disseminate                      
              information on the newest curatorial technologies for preserving               
              specimens, and to establish international collaborations for                   
              coordinating collecting and curating efforts.  A proceedings volume            
              will be published and distributed at no cost to Latin American                 
              participants in the symposium, and to natural history libraries in             
              the region.  Preserving natural history collections in tropical                
              regions is critical because of the high rate at which habitats are             
              being destroyed, and species are becoming extinct.  These museum               
              specimens will provide the sole means of studying many life forms,             
              and their preservation is critical to future generations of                    
              researchers.
