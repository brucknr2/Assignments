Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will be used at the Massachusetts Institute of                      
              Technology to develop a new generation of photometers based on                 
              Charge Coupled Devices (CCD) for use in observing occultations of              
              stars by objects in the Solar System.  When compared with                      
              conventional high-speed photometers that use photomultipliers, a               
              CCD-based photometer provides much greater quantum efficiency over             
              a broader wavelength range, the ability to guide the telescope                 
              directly from the CCD image, and the ability to construct a much               
              smaller synthetic photometric aperture after the fact that tracks              
              image motion and can be optimized for changing seeing conditions.              
              As a result, the CCD-based photometer provides a substantially                 
              greater signal-to-noise ratio than the traditional photometer for              
              a given event, and it allows useful observations of the more                   
              numerous events involving fainter stars to be made.  The high-speed            
              CCD photometer must be portable in order to be used with a portable            
              telescope or a fixed telescope that happens to lie within an                   
              occultation path.
