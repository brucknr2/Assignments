Abstract    :
              Experiments are directed towards understanding various aspects of              
              the electronic structure of solids using Inelastic Electron                    
              Scattering (IES) AND Soft X-ray Emission (SXE) Spectroscopy.                   
              The electronic excitations over a wide energy range are measured               
              which allows Kramers-Kronig analyses of the data to be carried out.            
              Dynamical effects may be obtained by studying the momentum-transfer            
              dependence of the Spectral features.                                           
              The systems utilized have several unique features, which include               
              low temperature sample holders, in situ ion cleaning and Auger                 
              analysis, and sample changers which do not disturb the UHV                     
              environment.  Instrumental development is a complementary aspect of            
              the program.                                                                   
              In addition, studies are made using synchrotron sources at NIST and            
              NSLS.
