Abstract    :
              This award provides partial funding for a workshop to access                   
              current state-of-the-art schemes for implementation of high-                   
              performance parallel machines.  For large high-speed parallel                  
              systems, the problems facing the computer designer must be                     
              addressed from both the architecture and the interconnection                   
              perspective.  Machine and packaging engineers must work in concert             
              in order to identify and solve the issues pertaining to clock                  
              distribution, routing, and partitioning before the hardware layout             
              is done.  The effects of interconnects and packaging on parallelism            
              and clock speed are evaluated.  Also, the workshop addresses                   
              subjects related to board, chip area constraints, signal                       
              degradation, electromagnetic modeling and simulation of                        
              interconnects, CAD simulation, optical computing, and their effect             
              on machine performance.  Workshop areas include microelectronics               
              packaging, optoelectronics, machine architecture, processor design,            
              VLSI, and CAD with topics grouped into one of three areas:  (1)                
              Electronics Packaging and Interconnects; (2) Optoelectronics and               
              Optical Technologies; (3) Machine Architecture.
