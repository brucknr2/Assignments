Abstract    :
                   This project is a study of air/sea exchange and tropospheric              
              chemistry of biogenic trace gases over the oceans.  The first phase            
              of the study is on a shipboard field experiment to determine the               
              diurnal variations of sulfur gases (DMS, CS2, H2s, and SO2) in the             
              marine boundary layer in order to estimate rates of emission and               
              atmospheric oxidation.  This scientific team will work                         
              collaboratively with other research groups to investigate the                  
              relationship between gas phase chemistry and the chemical and                  
              physical characteristics of the marine aerosol.  The field work                
              will be carried out in the eastern South Pacific ocean.  The cruise            
              will be a multi-investigator experiment and is a component of the              
              MAGE/IGAC (Marine Aerosol and Gas Experiment/International Global              
              Atmospheric Chemistry) Program.
