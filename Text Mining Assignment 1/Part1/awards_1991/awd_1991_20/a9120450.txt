Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Manatees are endangered species of the Order Sirenia and exhibit               
              several unusual traits in brain anatomy which appear to be                     
              related to their unique lifestyle. Manatees have an annual death               
              rate of approximately 150 individuals from a total population of               
              about 1500-2000. This fact, coupled with their slow reproductive               
              replacement rate, leads to the real possibility exists that we                 
              are witnessing the last opportunity to study the biology of these              
              unique mammals.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Each mammalian species represents an "experiment" by nature and                
              every unusual species helps define the range of possible                       
              evolutionary outcomes, increases our understanding of                          
              evolutionary potential, and enables the reconstruction of the                  
              evolutionary history of the brain.  At present, we have some                   
              understanding of how certain peculiar features of manatee brains               
              may be correlated with their unique ecological niche; for                      
              example, the small brain/body-weight ratio, smooth cerebral                    
              hemispheres, and low cell densities in the cortex.  The present                
              research will enable the identification of different cortical                  
              areas in the manatee based on cellular staining patterns and will              
              suggest functional roles for these regions through comparisons                 
              with other mammalian species. Computer-generated three-                        
              dimensional reconstructions of cerebral hemispheres  and                       
              determination of the volumes of the major brain divisions are                  
              also major objectives.
