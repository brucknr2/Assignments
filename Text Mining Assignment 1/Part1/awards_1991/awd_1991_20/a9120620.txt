Abstract    :
              Armstrong         This research is on methods to create behavior models that 
              accurately represent the functionality and timing of complex  devices.  The
              work is on developing a "Modeler's Assistant" as a  base for structured
              development of behavioral models.  Specific  problems being solved are:
              developing a process primitive set for  the Modeler's Assistant, developing and
              evaluating performance  measures for structured behavioral model development,
              developing  a natural language interface for the Modeler's Assistant, and 
              building into the Modeler's Assistant the capability to  automatically generate
              tests for any behavioral model which has  been constructed by the system. 
              Behavioral models are being  expressed in the high-level language, VHDL.
