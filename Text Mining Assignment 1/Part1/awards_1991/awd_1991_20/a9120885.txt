Abstract    :
                   This award covers Experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics research by a group at the University of Rochester in                  
              collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists.                     
              The group will conclude its studies of energetic photons                       
              produced at large angles in high-energy pion and proton-                       
              nucleus collisions.  They will compare the observed photon                     
              yields with Quantum Chromodynamic calculations within the                      
              standard picture of interacting quarks and leptons.  The group                 
              also will study proton-antiproton collisions at the highest                    
              accessible energies to test extrapolations of Standard Model                   
              predictions.  The expertise of this group in calorimetry and                   
              detector construction will contribute to preparations for                      
              experiments at the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC).
