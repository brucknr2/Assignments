Abstract    :
              The control of the mitotic and meiotic behavior of eukaryotic                  
              chromosomes is essential for genetic stability of cells during                 
              growth and reproduction.  An understanding of the cis- and trans-              
              acting elements that are required for proper chromosome behavior is            
              therefore of critical importance.  The focus of the investigations             
              in our laboratory is on the structure present at the ends of the               
              eukaryotic chromosome, called the telomere.  The goal of this                  
              proposal is to investigate the function of the predominant yeast               
              telomere binding protein, RAP1.  To begin to understand the role of            
              RAP1 at the yeast telomere two approaches are being proposed: a)               
              the biochemical and genetic characterization of a series of novel              
              semi-dominant alleles of RAP1 that specifically influence a number             
              of telomere-related processes, and b) a genetic study of the                   
              interactions between RAP1 and other gene products affecting                    
              telomere length.  These studies will ultimately be applied to the              
              isolation and characterization of extragenic suppressors of rap|               
              mutations: a key step in the identification of factors interacting             
              with RAP1 in its role at the telomere.
