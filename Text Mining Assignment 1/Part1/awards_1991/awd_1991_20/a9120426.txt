Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves two social scientists studying how rural                 
              Mexican families use remittance funds from migrant workers in the              
              US.  Two anthropologists and an economist will survey households               
              in four peasant villages in Michoacan, Mexico.  Using a                        
              combination of ethnographic, in-depth interview techniques and                 
              econometric surveys of household consumption patterns, the                     
              project will study how migration itself changes household values               
              about the sorts of goods consumed.                                             
                                                                                             
              Most studies of migration and consumption assume that migrants                 
              have fixed economic needs or targets.  This project's analysis of              
              how migration changes the cultural basis of consumption will                   
              provide information that will advance our understanding of why                 
              people migrate from Mexico to the US. This understanding is                    
              important as our two nations draw closer together economically.
