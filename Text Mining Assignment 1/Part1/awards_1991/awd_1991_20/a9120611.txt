Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Relatively little is known about how the cortex of the brain                   
              processes information about taste in humans and primates.  In fact,            
              only a relative small percentage of nerve cells in the frontal                 
              cortex appear to be taste-responsive.  Thus, taste input does not              
              dominate the input to this portion of cortex in the same way that              
              visual input dominates input to the posterior cortex.  Much more               
              information is needed in order to better understand how the highest            
              levels of the brain receive and analyze taste information.                     
                                                                                             
              The goals of this research are:  (l) to define the total scope of              
              activity in the taste regions of the cortex, (2) to describe the               
              basic characteristics of nerve cells responding to taste, (3) to               
              determine the basic principles that the taste system uses to                   
              identify different taste qualities, (4) to describe how similar the            
              primate taste system is to the human taste system by comparing                 
              nerve cell responses to the perceptions that humans report when                
              they taste the same solutions, and (5) to discover how various                 
              tastes may cause likes or dislikes in a perceptual sense.
