Abstract    :
              Eastern Virginia Medical School is establishing a connection to                
              NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line through the Virginia                  
              Educational and Research Network and the SURANET mid-level network.            
              The connection enhances collaborations of campus researchers with              
              colleagues in several medical fields, as well as on-line access to             
              remote bibliography databases.  This award funds part of the costs             
              for twelve months.
