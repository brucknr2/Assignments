Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Minnesota Private College Research Foundation (MPCRF) requests             
              support from NSF for connection of St. John's University, College              
              of St. Benedict, Concordia College, and the Minneapolis College of             
              Art and Design to the Minnesota Regional Network (MRNet) which is              
              the NSF mid-level network that serves Minnesota.  A primary goal of            
              the network is to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing of             
              resources between instutuion, including those outside the state.               
                                                                                             
              MRNet will provide operations management and information services              
              and it will give the four universities a connection to the NSFNET,             
              a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone              
              network.  The project will also support an upgrade of central site             
              redundant and spare equipment.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The universities need greater functionality and network speed to be            
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers              
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This is             
              also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore innovative                
              educational resources.***
