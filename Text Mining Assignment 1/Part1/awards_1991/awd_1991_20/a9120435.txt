Abstract    :
              The University of Montana is establishing a connection to NSFNET               
              via a 56,000 bits per second line through the NorthWestNet                     
              mid-level network.  The connection enhances collaborations of                  
              campus researchers with colleagues in several fields such as                   
              biology, physics, computer science, geology and forestry, and                  
              enables on-line access to remote bibliography databases and                    
              supercomputers.  This award funds part of the costs for one                    
              year.
