Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary purpose of this Dissertation Improvement proposal is to            
              examine the relationship between body size, locomotion and                     
              structural properties of the fore and hindlimb bones in several                
              species of small to mid-sized primates.  The relationships will be             
              calculated in modern specimens for which full skeletons are                    
              available.  Subsequently, a variety of Eocene primates will be                 
              studied in order to clarify knowledge of their locomotor modes as              
              well as body mass.  This approach is necessary as most Eocene                  
              primates are poorly represented in the fossil record and as                    
              inference as to behavior is always difficult when working with                 
              fossil remains.
