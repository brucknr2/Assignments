Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting a research program by                         
              Professor R. Stephen Berry at the University of Chicago that is                
              investigating several related topics.  One goal is the                         
              elucidation of the dynamics of clusters, particularly phase                    
              changes in clusters and their relationship to bulk phase                       
              transitions.  A related topic deals with surface melting and                   
              the development of an analytic theory of sintering and a                       
              quantifiable model for the disappearance of grain boundaries                   
              during sintering.  A third area concerns computation of                        
              rotation-vibration levels of small polyatomic molecules.

              Small clusters of tens to thousands of atoms provide an                        
              intermediate between isolated molecules, which have been                       
              extensively studied by chemists, and the condensed states of                   
              matter, which present many complicated features.  The work of                  
              Professor Berry deals mainly with study of this intermediate                   
              scale of organization with the goal of learning basic                          
              principles that will be useful in macroscopic applications to                  
              bulk materials.
