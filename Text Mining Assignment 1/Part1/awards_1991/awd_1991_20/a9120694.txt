Abstract    :
                   This Special Minority Award provides a year of support                    
              for Mr. Arthur Mateos, who is beginning graduate studies at                    
              MIT.  The award will allow the incumbent to finish his course                  
              work expeditiously and reach the research participation phase                  
              of his studies sooner.  This award is an integral part of the                  
              strategy of the National Science Foundation to strengthen and                  
              increase minority participation in the field of physics.
