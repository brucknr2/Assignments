Abstract    :
                Computing hardware, digital memory systems, and high speed                   
              computer networks have progressed to the point where building                  
              very large digital document collections and providing facile                   
              distributed access to these collections is practical and                       
              economical.  However, many difficult problems still stand in the               
              way of implementing such systems.  The time is ripe to begin                   
              building a broad science base to support this activity and to                  
              begin academic programs at universities to produce the PhD's                   
              needed to advance progress in this area.                                       
                This award funds a three day workshop to bring together about                
              30 key researchers in the area of information capture and access.              
              Participants represent broad coverage of the research area and a               
              balance between industrial and academic and between project                    
              implementors and more science base oriented individuals.  The                  
              workshop will be held November 12-14, 1991 in Ithaca, New York.                
              The coordinators are John Hopcroft, chair Computer Science                     
              Department, Cornell University and Gregory Zack, manager Xerox                 
              Design Research Area.                                                          
                The primary objectives of the workshop are to determine the                  
              state of the art in information capture and access, to identify                
              key research efforts and projects, and to highlight research                   
              direction where progress is likely.  In addition the workshop                  
              will identify common infrastructure that would foster cooperative              
              research efforts.  The Xerox Corporation is a co-sponsor of the                
              workshop.  //
