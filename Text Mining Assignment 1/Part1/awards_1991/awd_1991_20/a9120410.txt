Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Project objectives are to enhance student visualization of                
              complex meteorological principles, introduce students to the                   
              principles of numerical weather prediction and computer models,                
              participate fully in the Unidata project and facilitate faculty and            
              student research using high speed computer platforms.  These                   
              objective will be met using Unidata's OS/2-based McIDAS and UNIX-              
              based Scientific Data Management (SDM) systems.                                
                   Funds are provided to a UNIX-based workstation capable of                 
              running Unidata's SDM system.  This requisition will significantly             
              enhance the processing of the Domestic Data Plus circuit.                      
              Processing of the McIDAS data stream at Lyndon will be upgraded by             
              the acquisition of two PC computers, augmenting a network of 4                 
              previously acquired IBM PS/2s (1987 NSF Grant CSI-8750236) which               
              are marginally configured to process the data stream.  Simultaneous            
              windowed displays of radar and conventional data using the WXP                 
              program in the SDM and McIDAS displays of satellite imagery and                
              gridded fields will speed computers, present interactive computer              
              programs and models can be run on time frames compatible with                  
              individual class sessions.  Numerical prediction methods can be                
              demonstrated to upper level students.  The faster computers and new            
              data will foster future student and faculty research projects while            
              enhancing current ones.
