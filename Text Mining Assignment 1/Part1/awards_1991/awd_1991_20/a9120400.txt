Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Compuational Chemistry Program of the                      
              Chemistry Division will support Kellman in a series of                         
              theoretical analyses of the dynamics of highly excited                         
              rotation-vibration spectra of polyatomic molecules.  The work                  
              will concentrate in three areas:  (1) dynamics of strongly                     
              coupled vibrations from experimental spectra, investigating the                
              relation of spectral patterns to phase space structure                         
              including low-frequency modes, and phase space structure and                   
              bond selective reactivity, (2) work with chaotic systems with                  
              many degrees of freedom including search for dynamical                         
              constants of motion and quantum number assignments, and phase                  
              space bifurcation structure and catastrophe maps for chaotic                   
              systems, and (3) determination of molecular potential surfaces                 
              from "bootstrap" fitting of highly excited spectra.                            
              %%%                                                                            
              Modern laser experiments can deposit a large amount of energy                  
              in molecules, converting them into highly excited states which                 
              are not easily, if at all, describable in the terms that                       
              chemists and physicists have used so successfully for matter in                
              or near its ground, most relaxed state.  Kellman is developing                 
              analytical tools to interpret such experiments and the highly                  
              complex or chaotic states that they produce.  There are                        
              possible practical consequences in terms of the use of laser                   
              excitation to affect selected bonds in a molecule, but the                     
              principle purpose is to understand more fully the nature of                    
              highly excited molecular matter.
