Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a two year study of calving dynamics              
              for the floating ice shelf of Jakobshavns Isbrae on the west                   
              coast of Greenland.  Jakobshavns presents the full range of ice                
              calving environments, ranging from slow sheet-flow calving from a              
              south-facing ice wall into a shallow proglacial lake, through                  
              faster sheet-flow calving from a north-facing ice cliff into                   
              water of increasing depth, to the fastest known stream-flow                    
              calving from the west-facing cliff of a floating ice shelf in                  
              Jakobshavns Isfjord.  Photogrammetric maps showing ice topography              
              and ice velocity will be used as input for finite-element                      
              computer modeling of both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous creep of              
              ice that leads to fracture (crevassing) and calving.  The                      
              proposed study has applications beyond Jakobshavns Isbrae, in                  
              particular applications relating to calving of Antarctic ice                   
              shelves.
