Abstract    :
              The 14th Polar Libraries Colloquy (14 PLC) will be held May 3-7,               
              1992 and hosted by the Byrd Polar Research Center of The Ohio State            
              University in Columbus, Ohio.  The theme of the Colloquy is                    
              "International Sharing of Polar Information Resources."  This theme            
              reflects some of the objectives of the Arctic Research and Policy              
              Act of 1984 (ARPA) and also supports the U.S. Arctic Research Plan.            
              The 14 PLC will be a forum for sharing information on current                  
              international initiatives which aid in the bibliographic control               
              of polar literature, and will also provide an opportunity to share             
              knowledge of specific polar collections.  The 14 PLC program will              
              emphasize the current status of the accessibility of polar                     
              information and ways in which the participants of the Colloquy can             
              cooperate, either as individuals or as a group, to further the goal            
              of increasing access to this information.  The proceedings will be             
              published and widely distributed internationally.
