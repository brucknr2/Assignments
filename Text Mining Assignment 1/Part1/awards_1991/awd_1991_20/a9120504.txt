Abstract    :
              In this project in experimental physical chemistry funded by                   
              the Chemistry Division, Professors Moore and Tossell                           
              (University of Maryland) will study electron capture reactions                 
              and other ionic processes in plasmas, using several                            
              spectroscopic techniques. These include electron transmission                  
              spectroscopy and photoionization mass spectrometry. Materials                  
              to be studied include several fluorocarbons and silanes which                  
              are of immediate interest in the plasma chemical deposition                    
              processes used in commercial manufacture of semiconductor                      
              devices.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Ultraminiature semiconductor devices used in all modern                        
              computers are made by depositing appropriate materials from                    
              dense, electrically charged gases called plasmas. The new field                
              of plasma chemistry thus has immense technological importance.                 
              Professors Moore and Tossell will use a combination of quantum                 
              mechanical theory and modern spectroscopic methods to elucidate                
              the nature of prototypical chemical reactions in plasmas.
