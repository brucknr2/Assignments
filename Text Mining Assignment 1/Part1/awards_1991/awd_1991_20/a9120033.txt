Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a travel grant for a Gordon research conference                        
              (August 19-23, 1991) for ion exchangers and adsorbents.  The                   
              presentations focus on ion exchange phenomena and materials.                   
              About twenty industrial and academic speakers from the U. S.                   
              and abroad will participate.  A poster session for graduate                    
              students is also planned.  The discussions will help                           
              scientific communications, interdisciplinary interaction, and                  
              education in important fields of separation science and                        
              technology.
