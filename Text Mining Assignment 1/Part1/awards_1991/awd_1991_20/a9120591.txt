Abstract    :
                   Alfven wave chaos is examined in two related studies.                     
              The first effort examines the driven Burgers equation, which                   
              has only one kind of shock wave, and is easier to solve than                   
              the more complex DLNSB equation.  Using this equation it is                    
              possible to examine the essential dependencies of the onset of                 
              chaos on the number of harmonics and their growth rates.  The                  
              second problem explores the analytic and numerical properties                  
              of oblique Alfven shock trains via the driven Korteweg-                        
              deVries-Burgers equation.
