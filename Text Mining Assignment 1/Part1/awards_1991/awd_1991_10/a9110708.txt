Abstract    :
              This project examines the economic and social dynamics of                      
              subsistence hunting and fishing among young adult Inuit in two                 
              Canadian Arctic communities: Holmon and Clyde River. Both husbands             
              and wives will be interviewed to construct an accurate picture of              
              dietary patterns, food-sharing networks, Inuit self-identity,                  
              harvest activities and wage-employment. These data will be used to             
              examine how subsistence hunting fits into the overall economic                 
              strategies of young adult households, an important issue with                  
              respect to the future direction of northern society in Canada,                 
              Alaska and much of the Arctic world.
