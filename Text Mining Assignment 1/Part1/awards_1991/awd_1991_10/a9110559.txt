Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to collect a four-month time series of high quality             
              meteorological variables and the structure of the ocean's upper 30             
              m in the Western Pacific Warm Pool. The observations will take                 
              place in late 1992 to early 1993 during the Intensive Observation              
              Period (IOP) of the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean             
              Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE). The goal of the                   
              experiment is to understand and describe the oceanic response to               
              Westerly wind bursts and rainfall.
