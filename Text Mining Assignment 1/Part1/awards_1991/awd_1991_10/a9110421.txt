Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              This project seeks to gain access to the cognitive structure                   
              underlying linguistic expression.  New technology in the domain                
              of multi-media presentation may allow contemporary theories in                 
              semantics and discourse analysis to be tested empirically.                     
                                                                                             
              The hypothesis to be investigated is that a subject employs a                  
              process of reduction in perceiving and interpreting a complex                  
              narrative event, organizing the event into a hierarchy of more                 
              and less important subevents.  The investigator will develop and               
              employ a novel methodology based on recording a complex stimulus               
              event on a video laser disc, and then manipulating the                         
              presentation of the event to subjects in a variety of ways which               
              will permit analysis of the subjects' responses.                               
                                                                                             
              If the investigation is successful, it will become possible to                 
              analyze nonlinguistic narrative event structure with a new degree              
              of precision and insight, and to arrive at a more detailed and                 
              comprehensive understanding of the relationship between a                      
              perceived nonlinguistic event and the linguistic expression of                 
              that event.
