Abstract    :
                   The subject of this program, supported as a Research                      
              Planning Grant for Women Scientists and Engineers (NSF90-121) is               
              the preparation of a plan for experimental investigations of                   
              self-pumped phase conjugation in photorefractive materials,                    
              through two types of measurements:  1) the photon counting                     
              distribution and 2) the second-order correlation function.                     
              Research planning activities include extended visits in the                    
              laboratories of experts in photon-counting and laser intensity                 
              stabilization, and in optical scattering in solids.
