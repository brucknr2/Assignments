Abstract    :
              Machines During the past decade, parallel database systems                     
              havegained increased popularity due to their high                              
              performance,scalability, and availability characteristics.  With               
              thepredicted future database sizes and complexity of queries,it                
              is essential that these systems effectively utilizehundreds or                 
              thousands of processors.  Several studies haverepeatedly                       
              demonstrated that both the performance and scalability of a                    
              parallel database system is contingent on the physical layout of               
              the data across the processors of the system.Recently, the design              
              of a new declustering strategy, termed Multi-Attribute GrId                    
              deClustering (MAGIC), was introduced.  MAGIC is superior to the                
              current declustering strategies because it can partition a                     
              relation using two or more of its attributes.  In addition, it                 
              minimizes the overhead of using parallelism to allow the system                
              to scale to a large number of processors.  This project focuses                
              on: (1) analysis and extension of MAGIC for executing complex                  
              queries, and (2) incorporation of algorithms for dynamic on-line               
              reorganization of a relation in the presence of update queries                 
              and changing workload characteristics.The approach involves                    
              development of analytical and simulation models first, followed                
              by a prototype implementation.  This research enhances the                     
              scalability of a parallel database machine and improve its                     
              performance for executing complex queries.
