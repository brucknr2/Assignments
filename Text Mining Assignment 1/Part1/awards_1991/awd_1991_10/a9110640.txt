Abstract    :
              This proposal involves a request to purchase the Fuji Bio-Imaging              
              Analyzer (Phosphorimager), a new device for the detection and                  
              quantitation of radioactivity used in a variety of biochemical                 
              experiments.  The quantitative capabilities of this instrument will            
              allow biochemical experiments not currently possible. The primary              
              advantages of this technology over conventional autoradiography                
              using x-ray film are an increased linear response, dynamic range,              
              and sensitivity, as well as reduced exposure time.  The instrument             
              provides quantitative data from experiments involving the use of               
              this radioisotopes such as 32P, 35S, 14C, and 125I.  An instrument of          
              this type is not currently available at the Whitehead Institute.               
              The quantitation of radioactive samples will be carried out by the             
              user groups in a variety of biochemical and molecular biology                  
              experiment detailed in Section 8.  The technology involves the use             
              of storage phosphor screens which store energy form sample beta                
              particle emission.  This emission is detected by the instrument and            
              stored on a computer hard disk.  The data can then be accessed and             
              analyzed using a software package provided with the instrument.  A             
              number of quantitative biochemical experiments not currently                   
              possible will be feasible because the Phosphorimager is vastly                 
              superior to X-ray film autoradiography.
