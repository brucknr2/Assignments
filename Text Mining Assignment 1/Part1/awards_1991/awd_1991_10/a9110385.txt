Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) project is located at the             
              Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre in England.  This award                 
              from the Division of Chemistry, Office of Special Projects will                
              provide approximately 25 percent of the support for access to this             
              database by U.S. scientists from the academic, government, and                 
              not-for-profit research communities.  This contribution will be                
              transferred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as the                  
              Foundation becomes a co-supporter of the CSD.  The U.S. has over               
              1600 crystallographers who are potential users of this database.               
                                                                                             
              The CSD contains the most comprehensive collection of evaluated                
              crystallographic data in the world.  Data for about 80,000 organic             
              and organometallic crystal structures  were included in the CSD as             
              of January, 1991.  Atomic coordinates, chemical connectivity                   
              tables, bibliographic data fields including reference sources for              
              the data, and coordinates for chemical structure diagrams for each             
              molecule are part of the system.  Software for search, retrieval,              
              and analysis of the data will be supplied as well as any                       
              improvements and updates of the software.  About 8000 new crystal              
              structures will be added to the data base yearly.  Thus this                   
              international resource will remain accessible to crystallographic              
              community and other users in the U.S. through the joint support of             
              NSF and NIH.
