Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports two cultural anthropologists and a Nepalese              
              colleague in a study of how women in Nepal criticize their                     
              subjugated position in society through the medium of songs sung                
              at a traditional festival.  Major socio-cultural changes are                   
              occurring now in Nepal and the project will study the production               
              of novel songs of critical social commentary as they are sung at               
              the festival.  Methods include participant observation, extensive              
              interviews of women and of men, and examination of printed                     
              songbooks.  The research focus is to understand the micro-process              
              by which gender relations in a patriarchal society are changing.               
                                                                                             
              This research is important because patriarchal social systems                  
              exist in most traditional societies, and are faced with severe                 
              pressures for more egalitarian social relationships (e.g., the                 
              recent complaint of middle-class Kuwaiti women about their                     
              inability to legally drive their families out of war danger due                
              to the Muslim prohibition on woman drivers).  Understanding how                
              gender relations are protested in traditional discourse in one                 
              case will help us understand the general processes of social                   
              change in gender relations in traditional societies.
