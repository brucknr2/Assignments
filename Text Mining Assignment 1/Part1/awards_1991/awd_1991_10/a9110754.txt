Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Measurements of the collective excitations of liquid helium have               
              led to a detailed understanding of the microscopic dynamics in                 
              both the normal and superfluid (sf) phases.  Inelastic neutron                 
              scattering has proven to be one of the most useful tools in                    
              studying these excitations.  It is proposed to extend these                    
              studies to negative pressures.  At low negative pressure the                   
              liquid is metastable, allowing measurements to be carried out.                 
              At larger negative pressures (around 9 bars), the speed of sound               
              approaches zero and the liquid is no longer stable.  Macroscopic               
              samples (one or more cc. in volume) of liquid He at negative                   
              pressure will be created using a novel expansion cell.  The time               
              structure of a typical short-pulse neutron source will be used to              
              carry out inelastic n scattering measurements in the interval                  
              between pressure equilibration and the nucleation of gas bubbles.
