Abstract    :
              A necessary part of language understanding by people or                        
              computersis to determine the meaning of ambiguous words.  Efforts              
              at automatic disambiguation of text have so far been evaluated by              
              ad hoc, manual checking of their results.  As more disambiguation              
              systems are developed and put to use, a rigorous method of                     
              evaluation becomes necessary.  This work will study text                       
              disambiguation by human informants, to aid in developing both a                
              formal model of the process and a metric or correctness for                    
              automatic disambiguation.  The study will include the selection                
              of representative texts and development from these of a                        
              disambiguation test to be administered to a large sample (over                 
              100) of informants, from university students to professional                   
              lexicographers.  Analysis of the test results will provide                     
              insight into the human disambiguation process that will                        
              contribute to the evaluation and refinement of current models of               
              disambiguation, both human and computation, and eventually to                  
              thedevelopment of new models.  The test results themselves will                
              form a statistical profile of the disambiguation of English text,              
              as a benchmark for efforts at automatic disambiguation.
