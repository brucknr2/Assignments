Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are to develop expressions for                  
              the thermal properties of protein, fat, and carbohydrate food                  
              components during freezing.  These food components are                         
              considered to be the building blocks of food materials.  The                   
              specific objectives are to:  1) to identify standard materials                 
              for use in food freezing studies which represent the basic                     
              food components;  2) to construct phase diagrams for these                     
              materials;  3) to develop relationships between temperature                    
              and unfrozen moisture content for each test material; and,  4)                 
              to develop thermal property relationships for these materials                  
              during freezing.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The first task is to identify protein, fat, and carbohydrate                   
              based test materials which represent the basic components of                   
              foods.  Then, phase diagrams will be formulated from phase                     
              transition temperatures determined for different                               
              concentrations of these materials from differential scanning                   
              calorimetry experiments.  The expressions for the thermal                      
              properties will be based on thermodynamic relationships                        
              between temperature and moisture content formulated from these                 
              phase diagrams.  The building block concept represents a novel                 
              approach to the investigation of the freezing process, and it                  
              has great future potential for the expanded practical use of                   
              mathematical food freezing models which require knowledge of                   
              the thermal properties.  First of all, use of this concept                     
              eliminates the need for freezing point depression data to be                   
              available for different food products, and secondly, it could                  
              result in simplified thermal property relationships which                      
              would facilitate the use of complex multi-dimensional freezing                 
              models.
