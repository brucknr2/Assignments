Abstract    :
              Multi-status insurance contracts cannot be completely modelled with            
              traditional actuarial techniques.  Improved analysis of the                    
              stochastic nature of these contracts will allow insurers to more               
              aggressively price and market such products for the benefit of both            
              the insured and the policyholder.  This project will develop and               
              analyze the formulas for the mean and variance of discounted cash              
              flows arising from multi-status insurance contracts such as long               
              term care(LTC) insurance.  Where practical, the project will                   
              produce computer software to evaluate these moment formulas.  Where            
              such formulas are impractical, the project will present guidelines             
              for the simulation of these moments.  LTC insurance will provide               
              numerical examples of the calculation techniques.  Results will be             
              submitted for publication in appropriate insurance and actuarial               
              journals.
