Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to support research                      
              activities which would establish a molecular biological track                  
              record for Dr. Bennett and her laboratory.  Dr. Bennett's goal is              
              to use the technique of DNA microinjection and other molecular                 
              genetic manipulations in order to study germline determination in              
              developing nematodes, with particular emphasis on the role of                  
              cyclin B.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              By expanding her expertise in this way, Dr. Bennett will be poised             
              to make important and timely contributions to the field of                     
              Developmental Biology.  The results to be obtained from this                   
              research are anticipated to significantly enhance Dr. Bennett's                
              career.
