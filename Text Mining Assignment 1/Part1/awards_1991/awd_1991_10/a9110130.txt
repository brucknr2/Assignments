Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              People define themselves in part in terms of the groups or                     
              categories to which they belong, e.g. as women, attorneys,                     
              African-Americans, or parents.  These group memberships, or                    
              social identities, motivate people's behavior and influence the                
              way they react to others.  Important distinctions exist among                  
              identities, however.  Two ways in which identities differ are:                 
              (1) whether an identity is ascribed, such as gender or ethnicity,              
              or achieved, such as an occupation or a parent role; and (2)                   
              whether the identity is enacted primarily in the private or in                 
              the public domain.  Six studies, using a combination of                        
              laboratory experiments and structured interviews, will explore                 
              the implications of these differences for self-evaluation, group               
              evaluation, and interaction with others.  The overall goal is to               
              understand how various forms of identity relate to each other and              
              what characteristics of group membership are important for what                
              forms of social activity.
