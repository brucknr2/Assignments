Abstract    :
              This is a Research Initiation Award (RIA).  The research aims at               
              resolving long-standing problems with the use of speech-act                    
              theory in computational systems for natural language                           
              understanding and to provide methods of interpreting                           
              unconstrained discourse.  The integration of verbal and non-                   
              verbal speech acts are still very poorly understood and is                     
              critical for human-computer interactions.  This research seeks to              
              integrate many modalities with the study of speech acts, an                    
              important conceptual framework in speech and dialog processes.                 
              The goals are:  (1) to determine how the theory of meta-acts can               
              be extended and refined to model negotiations of reference and                 
              confirmation of mutuality of knowledge, and (2) to determine if                
              meta-act models can be validated predictively.  Meta-knowledge                 
              models include information about conversations that are non-                   
              verbal, such as turn-taking.  The project derives meta-acts as a               
              rational strategy of action, given attributions of the                         
              participants' beliefs, goals and expectations at the point in the              
              dialogue in which the acts actually occur.  The acts are then                  
              expressed in a rule-based simulation of similar conversations.  A              
              byproduct of the research is a database of analyzed and                        
              transcribed data useful for other researchers.  It is expected                 
              that there will be substantial impact in human-computer                        
              interactions research and aspects of research in speech and                    
              natural language processing.
