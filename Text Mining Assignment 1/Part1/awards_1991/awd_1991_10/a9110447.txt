Abstract    :
              Research to be carried out under a Research Initiation Award                   
              will investigate experimentally the effect on the turbulent                    
              boundary layer on a wall of dynamically modifying a section of                 
              that wall.  This section will be made to move in the                           
              streamwise direction.  Hot wire measurements will determine                    
              turbulent stresses and other statistical correlations, to                      
              characterize the details of the flow modification.                             
              Boundary layer control can be utilized to reduce friction                      
              losses and surface transfer in a variety of fluid engineering                  
              systems.
