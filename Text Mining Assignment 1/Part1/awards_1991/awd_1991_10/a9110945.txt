Abstract    :
                   The objectives of this project are to construct and analyze               
              a new allocation mechanism for semiconductor products by                       
              simultaneously determining specification levels and delivery                   
              priorities and to mathematically characterize and analyze the                  
              impacts on profitability of downgrading, complementarity, and                  
              substitutability of semiconductor products.  The essential idea                
              of the model is that the producer offers a "product line" of                   
              priority classes.  The producer's allocation rule is such that                 
              higher priority classes are supplied with higher specification                 
              level chips regardless of production outcome.  The product line                
              design and allocation rule allows the producer's profit                        
              maximization problem to be cast as a non-linear programming                    
              formulation.  In estimating supply quantity functions from actual              
              production data, the least square fit as well as kernel estimation             
              method and maximum penalized likelihood method will be employed.               
              For numerical profit maximization and subsequent sensitivity                   
              analysis, a standard non-linear optimization software will be                  
              utilized.                                                                      
                   The significance of this research is that it simultaneously               
              aims (1) to establish a systematic method to determine the optimal             
              specification levels of semiconductor products from an economic                
              perspective, (2) to improve the performance of semiconductor                   
              producers in on-schedule delivery of chips, (3) to better                      
              understand downgrading, complementarity, and substitutability of               
              semiconductor products with respect to profitability of products.
