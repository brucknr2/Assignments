Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The economic sources of growth in an open economy are well                     
              understood.  Modern growth and trade theory provide well accepted              
              explanations of the economic factors essential to growth.  What is             
              not well understood, however, are the political, institutional, and            
              behavioral preconditions for these well known economic factors to              
              be produced in adequate and efficient combinations.                            
                                                                                             
              This ambitious doctoral dissertation research undertakes a                     
              comparative study of the causes of economic growth in advanced                 
              industrial democracies.  The principal thesis of the project is                
              that economic growth is the outcome of a struggle over wages and               
              investment among workers, government and management.  Specifically,            
              the research attempts to understand how governments and labor                  
              markets in advanced industrial democracies combine to produce                  
              distinct national patterns of adjustment or mal-adjustment to                  
              changing conditions in international markets. Using a game                     
              theoretic model a series of hypotheses will be tested across 18                
              industrial democracies over a thirty year period.                              
                                                                                             
              When completed the project should advance our understanding of how             
              different domestic political and institutional arrangements produce            
              different levels and rates of economic growth across nations.
