Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Frogs are vertebrates with two distinct auditory organs,                  
              rather than the single cochlea of mammals.  A great deal is known              
              about frog calling communication behavior, and about the                       
              physiology of frog auditory systems.  However, unlike the case in              
              mammals, the anatomical details and ultrastructure of how the                  
              sensory hair cells are innervated is poorly known.  Such details               
              are important in forming hypotheses about mechanisms for the                   
              observed frequency selectivity and physiology of frog hearing.                 
                   This work will use light and electron microscopy to assess                
              how the receptor cells are innervated by the auditory nerve in                 
              both these organs, and then to study the detailed architecture                 
              of the functional contancts, the synapses, of single nerve fibers              
              in selected regions where function is known.  The results will be              
              important not only to comparative aspects of auditory function                 
              including physiology and behavior among species, but also to                   
              general principles of frequency coding mechanisms which are                    
              crucial to auditory neuroscience.
