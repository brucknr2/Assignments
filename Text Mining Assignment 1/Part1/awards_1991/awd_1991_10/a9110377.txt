Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long-terms goals of this research are to understand the                    
              molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying mammalian learning                
              and memory.  Experiments performed during the last few years have              
              provided a relatively detailed and testable model describing a                 
              complex cascade of biochemical events leading from certain                     
              patterns of electrical activity to long term changes in synaptic               
              efficacy.  Dr. Michel Baudry will continue his work on synaptic                
              plasticity by using electrophysiological and biochemical                       
              techniques to evaluate the roles of regulatory mechanisms                      
              involved in the modulation of the properties of glutamate                      
              receptor subtypes in long-term potentiation and long-term                      
              depression in the hippocampus.  This work will be performed on                 
              mice, some of which are genetically different from others.                     
              Information obtained should provide a more refined description of              
              the mechanisms underlying learning and memory not only in adults,              
              but also during the postnatal development period and to relate                 
              learning abilities to different genotypes.  This research has                  
              broad implications as it might provide not only fundamental                    
              knowledge concerning cognitive processes but also tools to                     
              alleviate learning disorders during development.
