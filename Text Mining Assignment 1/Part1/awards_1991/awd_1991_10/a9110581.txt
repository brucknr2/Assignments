Abstract    :
              Dynamic integrity constraints arise in many traditional and non-               
              traditional database applications; however, such constraints are               
              not supported by current database management systems.  This                    
              project focuses on efficient methods for checking dynamic                      
              integrity constraints in databases.  Past Temporal Logic and Past              
              Metric Temporal Logic are proposed as constraint languages,                    
              making it possible to formulate both qualitative and quantitative              
              temporal conditions.  The project includes the development and                 
              the implementation of a method to reduce dynamic integrity                     
              checking to static integrity checking.  If this method is used,                
              past database states do not have to be stored for the purpose of               
              dynamic integrity checking.  Instead, compressed historical                    
              information is stored in every database state as auxiliary                     
              relations.  The definitions of the needed auxiliary relations are              
              automatically derived from the constraints.  Techniques that                   
              optimize constraint checking and issues that arise from the                    
              integration of this new method with existing database management               
              systems will also be addressed.  The proposed research will                    
              significantly enlarge the application scope of database                        
              management systems and will make it easier to integrate these                  
              systems with real-time processes.
