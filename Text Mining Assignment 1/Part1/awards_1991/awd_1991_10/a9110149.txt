Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative                                                            
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Kenyan collaborative research project involving Florida              
              State University and University of Nairobi, is in the general                  
              area of climatology and numerical weather prediction.  Project                 
              funding will enable travel and a four-month site visit at Florida              
              State for the co-investigators, Dr. T.N. Krishnamurti (Forida                  
              State) and L.J. Ogallo (University of Nairobi), to prepare an                  
              Atlas of Recent African Climate, covering the period 1979-1990.                
              This effort will expand and update an Atlas recently published by              
              the co-PIs that covered the climate of the continent over the                  
              five-year period 1980-1984.  The data for each of the 144 months               
              for the following variables will be processed: tropospheric                    
              winds, temperature, humidity, geopotential heights, sea level                  
              pressure, sea surface temperature, vegetation index, rainfall                  
              distribution and the field of the outgoing longwave radiation.                 
              The Atlas will include sections on data quality, data validation,              
              data analysis and detailed sections on the interpretation of the               
              monthly mean fields, anomalies and intra-seasonal and inter-                   
              annual variability.  Once completed, the data sets will all                    
              reside on diskettes and tapes and will become available to young               
              scientists at the University of Nairobi.                                       
                                                                                             
              This project in climate modeling fulfills the program objective                
              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the                   
              United States and Kenya to combine their expertise and pool                    
              research resources to improve the ability to predict severe                    
              droughts and to monitor climate change.
