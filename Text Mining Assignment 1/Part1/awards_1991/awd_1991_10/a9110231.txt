Abstract    :
              Global warming associated with the greenhouse effect has emerged               
              as a leading environmental concern.  Many nations, including the               
              United States, are considering policy measures designed to reduce              
              the rate of green house gas emissions.  Moreover, multilateral                 
              action is being discussed under the auspices of the                            
              Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The objective of this              
              project is to develop a modeling framework for assessing the                   
              impact on the U.S. economy of policies aimed at mitigating global              
              climate change.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Specifically, the project consists of three separate, but related              
              parts.  The first involves developing new econometric methods for              
              estimating industry-wide models of productivity growth.                        
              Attention is focused on autonomous increases in efficiency for                 
              both energy and non-energy inputs.  The underlying model to be                 
              developed will allow productivity trends to be both deterministic              
              as well as stochastic.  Second, new methods will be developed for              
              assessing the distributional impacts of policies aimed at                      
              mitigating the effects of global climate change.  These                        
              distributional impacts are likely to be very significant,                      
              especially for policies that rely on taxation of energy use.  The              
              third part of the study will involve the development of new                    
              algorithms in order to achieve the maximum possible computational              
              efficiency in assessing the impact of policies aimed at                        
              mitigating climate change.
