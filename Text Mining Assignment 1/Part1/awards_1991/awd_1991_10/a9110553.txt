Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A one-month time series of high-resolution current profiles in the             
              upper 300 m in the Western Pacific Warm Pool will be collected with            
              side-looking and down-looking Doppler sonars. The purpose of the               
              study is to characterize the internal wave field generated by                  
              westerly wind bursts and the effects on mixing and fluxes near the             
              Ocean-Atmosphere interface. The observations will take place in                
              late 1992 to early 1993 during the Intensive Observation Period                
              (IOP) of the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere's Coupled Ocean                  
              Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE). The goal of the                   
              experiment is to understand and describe the oceanic response to               
              Westerly wind bursts and rainfall.
