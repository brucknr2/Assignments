Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for planning a                             
              research project to study biological processes for                             
              treatment of surfactant solutions that have been used to                       
              flush contaminants from soil.  The specific contaminant                        
              she plans to study is creosote and the biological process                      
              is planned to be conducted in a sequencing batch bench-                        
              scale reactor.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Creosote, the soil contaminant the investigator plans to                       
              study, has been used as a wood preservative for many years                     
              and has contaminated much soil in the vicinity of                              
              installations conducting wood preservation.  Results of                        
              this project are expected to include preliminary data on                       
              conditions under which this contaminant can be                                 
              biologically degraded and a full research proposal that                        
              will be submitted to NSF in accord with conditions listed
