Abstract    :
              This research is on accurate models of the electrical performance              
              of interconnections on digital circuits.  Maintenance of the                   
              fidelity of a signal as it propagates through various                          
              interconnections is a key factor in proper functioning of                      
              integrated circuits (IC's).  For very high-speed IC's, there is a              
              complicated electromagnetic nature of the signal propagation.                  
              Accurate models of the complex interconnection structures are                  
              difficult to obtain.  In the model being developed transient                   
              responses of signal propagation through interconnections are                   
              represented by the three-dimensional, full-wave, finite difference             
              solution of Maxwell's equations in the time domain.  This solution             
              is being developed to conform to the interconnection geometries                
              found in multilayer IC's.  Attention is being paid to excitation               
              and absorbing boundary conditions to ensure a high degree of                   
              numerical accuracy.  Various interconnection structures are being              
              analyzed, with special consideration being given to bends of                   
              different angles (connections on the same layer) and vias of                   
              different geometries (connections between adjacent layers).
