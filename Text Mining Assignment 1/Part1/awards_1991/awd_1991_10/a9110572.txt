Abstract    :
              This project studies how individuals actually make decisions under             
              uncertainty.  Respondents will state cash equivalences for                     
              prospects defined over events.  The project will then empirically              
              validate recent axiomatic models of decision making which allow                
              the separation of attitudes about consequences from attitudes about            
              risk and uncertainty and which are defined over events that do not             
              necessarily have a well-defined additive probability measure.  The             
              proposed research seeks to characterize risk attitudes as a                    
              function of the events(the weighting function) rather than the                 
              traditional view of characterizing risk attitudes as a function of             
              the utility curve.  Seven studies are proposed to understand                   
              people's attitudes about risk and uncertainty.  The main focus of              
              the studies will be to characterize properties of the weighting                
              function and understand the relationship between the source of the             
              uncertainty and the shape of the weighting function (i.e., source              
              dependence.)  Supplementing the empirical work will be a study of              
              additional constraints, or axioms, needed to specify functional                
              forms for the weighting function.
