Abstract    :
              The project involves the synthesis and characterization of the                 
              platinum complexes of thiazole derivatives and subsequent                      
              studies of their binding to nucleic acids and their                            
              constituents.  This will be part of an undergraduate research                  
              program at Trenton State College.  A detailed examination of                   
              the complexes by x-ray crystallography is planned.  Additional                 
              work will include  a detailed analysis of their binding modes                  
              in order to elucidate the mechanism of interaction with DNA.

              research proposal.  This project involves the synthesis and                    
              characterization of platinum organometallic compounds and their                
              bonding to DNA.
