Abstract    :
              The scientific goal of this project is to develop and test new                 
              applications of visual anthropology in cooperation with Native                 
              peoples of Siberia and Alaska. An integral part of the project is              
              a training workshop in ethnographic methods and video                          
              documentation; this will provide a mechanism for Alaskan and                   
              Siberian Natives to document their own cultures. The Siberian part             
              of the project is planned in collaboration with the Institute of               
              Ethnography and Anthropology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The              
              ethnographic part of the project will focus on community studies,              
              which have rarely been carried out in the USSR, and multi-ethnic               
              perceptions. This project will greatly facilitate the recording of             
              traditional knowledge in the Arctic and represents an advancement              
              of the method and theory of modern anthropology.
