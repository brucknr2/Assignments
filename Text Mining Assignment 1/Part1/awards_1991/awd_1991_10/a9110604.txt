Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The tissue at the back of the vertebrate eye is the                            
              retina, which contains photoreceptors and several other classes                
              of visual cells.  The two classes of photoreceptors are rods,                  
              for dim light, and cones, for color vision in bright light.  It                
              now appears that there is a suppressive effect by the rods on                  
              the cone cell responses, depending on the level of dark                        
              adaptation of the rods.  The mechanisms for these suppressive                  
              rod-cone interactions (SCRI) are not clear.                                    
                                                                                             
              This project will combine neurophysiological recording of                      
              membrane properties from retinal neurons, and pharmacological                  
              probing of the communication at synapses which are the                         
              functional contacts for neurochemical transmission between                     
              cells.  Using the amphibian retina as a model, results will be                 
              compared to the features known from psychophysical studies on                  
              cone-mediated sensitivity and its interaction with dark                        
              adaptation in humans.  Results from study of this novel                        
              phenomenon are expected to have an impact on visual science in                 
              general, on signal processing, and on network neuroscience.
