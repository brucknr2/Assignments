Abstract    :
              The major purpose of this research is to examine the implications              
              of learning for rational-expectations equilibria in markets.  The              
              setting for much of this work, experimental markets, makes it                  
              possible to clearly distinguish between the theory of the market               
              and people's behavior in that environment.  A series of experiments            
              will be run to discriminate among different models of learning.                
              The experiments will be set up to investigate Bayesian learning,               
              regression learning, and learning with heuristic learning rules.               
              The experimental market in which the data are generated is a                   
              sealed-bid market with suppliers who determine output and simulated            
              demanders.  This research is important because learning theories               
              are central to many current issues in economic theory.  in                     
              addition, this research will provide a deeper understanding about              
              the formation of rational expectations.
