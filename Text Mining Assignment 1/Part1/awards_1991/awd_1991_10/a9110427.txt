Abstract    :
              The 10th International Symposium on Computer Arithmetic will be                
              held June 26 through June 28, 1991 in Grenoble, France.  The                   
              Symposium Chairman is Dr. Jean-Michel Muller of LIP-IMAG.  This                
              international symposium is the tenth in a series and the third to              
              be held outside the U.S.  It is crucial to U.S. researchers to be              
              able to attend this symposium.  Travel funds requested in this                 
              proposal will allow more U.S. researchers to participate in the                
              symposium, to present research results, and to exchange research               
              ideas with their European colleagues.
