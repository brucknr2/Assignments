Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to determine consequences of                  
              seed dispersal by birds to composition and genetic structure of                
              shrubs in a tropical rain forest.  The research involves two                   
              phases.  The first phase (planning activities) will determine                  
              plant species diversity, seed density, and genetic relatedness of              
              seeds within droppings from five species of common fruit-eating                
              birds.  Seeds passed by these birds are identifiable and the                   
              relatedness of seeds within droppings can be estimated using                   
              starch gel electrophoresis.  During phase two the consequences                 
              occurring with related or unrelated seeds to plant survival and                
              growth will be examined through competition experiments using                  
              three light environments characteristic of tropical rain forests.              
                   In tropical rain forests, most seeds of understory plants                 
              are dispersed by birds.  This study will be the first to examine               
              relatedness of seeds in bird droppings and consequences to plants              
              of having seeds eaten and dispersed by different birds.                        
              Information on genetic and species composition of seeds in                     
              droppings of birds (planning activities) and results from                      
              competition experiments (phase two) will be used to develop                    
              models that predict genetic structure and composition of rain                  
              forest shrubs.  This research will contribute substantially to                 
              understanding tropical rain forests by testing ecological and                  
              evolutionary theories of plant-animal interactions.
