Abstract    :
              This research program concentrates on designing efficient graph                
              algorithms using topological methods.  The approaches are based on             
              recently developed techniques and results in topological graph theory.         
                   A topological approach is proposed to obtain a polynomial-time            
              bounded probabilistic algorithm solving the graph isomorphism problem,         
              which is one of the most important graph problems whose complexity             
              still remains unknown and which has many applications.  The method             
              adopted here is to derive a complete invariant of a graph that can be          
              computed efficiently, based on the combination of the topological and          
              combinatorial structures of the graph.                                         
                   The project is also seeking an extension of the theory and                
              applications of Whitney's linear synthesis theorem for 2-connected             
              graphs.  A concept of semi-k-connectedness of graphs is introduced,            
              and a conjecture is proposed that every k-connected graph has a semi-          
              k-connected linear synthesis.  Such an extension will provide us with          
              techniques that will find wide applications in designing efficient             
              sequential and parallel algorithms for such problems as graph                  
              connectivity, graph imbedding, and graph emulation.
