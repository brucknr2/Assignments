Abstract    :
              The proposed research deals with investigating the dynamic                     
              characteristics and response of truss structures during progressive            
              collapse initiated by a sudden failure of a member of a portion of             
              the structures.  In particular, it aims at studying the following:             
              i) changes in characteristics of the structure (e.g., natural                  
              frequencies and mode shapes) as the collapse of the structure                  
              progresses, ii) response of the structure (e.g., displacements,                
              stresses, etc.) during the collapse, and iii) vibration                        
              transmission through the structure.  The sudden rupture or failure             
              of members during the collapse of the structure will be adequately             
              represented by initial conditions, and then appropriate analytical             
              and numerical techniques will be employed/developed to solve the               
              dynamic problem.  Results from this study are expected to                      
              contribute to understand (i) the extent or role of dynamic effects             
              due to sudden failure of members on total collapsing of a truss-               
              like structure, (ii) the probable path along which the collapse                
              progresses, (iii) the probable modes of member failures in the                 
              process, and (iv) ways to prevent or minimize any potential                    
              collapsing if the structure.  The proposed investigation should be             
              useful in practical applications of design of truss-like                       
              structures, and in general, to fundamental research on "progressive            
              collapse" of structures on earth as well as in space.
