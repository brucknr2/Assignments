Abstract    :
              The research is on synthesis of custom and semi-custom analog                  
              integrated circuits (IC's).  The focus is on developing                        
              macromodeling techniques applicable to higher level analog and                 
              mixed analog/digital circuits.  These macromodels predict the                  
              behavior of a circuit for a set of input performance parameters.               
              The approach is to explore statistical experiment design techniques            
              to generate high quality models efficiently.  A set of models and              
              modeling techniques that help in predicting the behavior of                    
              circuits synthesized by a hierarchal design tool is being                      
              developed.
