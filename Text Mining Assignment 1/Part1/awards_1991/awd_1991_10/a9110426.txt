Abstract    :
              This Phase II proposal addresses research on III-V                             
              semiconductor materials grown heteroepitaxially on                             
              silicon (Si).  The feasibility of the proposed                                 
              approach was demonstrated in Phase I (Award No.                                
              ISI-8861448, during which Kopin evaluated lasers                               
              formed in GaAs grown heteroepitaxially on Si by                                
              organometallic chemical vapor deposition.                                      
              Although the approach was found feasible, the                                  
              Phase I work also demonstrated the need for                                    
              further reduction in the defect density of the                                 
              heteroepitaxial GaAs films; thus, the objective of                             
              the proposed Phase II research is the attainment of                            
              an improved understanding of growth mechanisms                                 
              that can be applied to reduce the deleterious effects                          
              of dislocations arising from the lattice mismatch.                             
              To more fully address the fundamental aspects of                               
              this research problem, we propose a collaborative                              
              program involving the University of Florida.  By                               
              with a high h level of characterization effort, we will                        
              develop an improved understanding of the materials                             
              and growth processes, leading ultimately to defect                             
              densities on the order of 104 cm -2.
