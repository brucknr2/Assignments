Abstract    :
              Quantum fluids and solids have served as important topics of                   
              research in their own right, and as model systems for understanding            
              similar physical phenomena exhibited in more complex materials.                
              They propose here three series of experiments intended to further              
              their physical understanding in both these regards.  The first                 
              series will involve ultrasound studies of the U2D2 phase of solid              
              3He with the intention of searching for the lattice distortion                 
              expected to occur upon nuclear spin ordering, and to more fully                
              measure the magnetic Gruneisen tensor.  These studies shoud help               
              answer a number of remaining fundamental questions regarding this              
              model magnetic system.  The second series will involve a search for            
              superfluidity in two dimensional sub-monolayer films of 3He                    
              adsorbed on top of 2-4 monolayer films of superfluid 4He.  If                  
              successful, this search will provide us with an entirely new BCS               
              superfluid state, which should shed light on possible 2D                       
              superconducting states.  Finally, they will investigate the process            
              by which the B-phase of superfluid 3He is nucleated from the A-                
              phase superfluid.  This seemingly simple problem is a particularly             
              tempting one because we know so much about these phases that they              
              feel they should be able to fully understand this transition.                  
              Further, the relevant length scale of the A to B nucleation is so              
              long that this transition represents a rare opportunity to                     
              understand in equisite detail inhomogeneous nucleation at a first              
              order phase transition.
