Abstract    :
              This project uses time-dependent liquid crystal thermography                   
              to capture images of the incipient pool phenomenon in                          
              dielectric fluids.  The results focus on two issues:  the                      
              distribution of temperature across the heated surface, and the                 
              inherently transient nature of the incipient boiling                           
              phenomenon.  The technique produces a temporal sequence of                     
              images of the surface temperature distribution.  These images                  
              show the surface temperature patterns as the system                            
              approaches, passes through, and sustains nucleate pool                         
              boiling.  Of particular interest is the transient process by                   
              which the nucleation sites activate and grow in number to                      
              displace the single-phase convection.  The effects of surface                  
              preparations, fluid subcooling, and content of dissolved gases                 
              will be investigated.  The results include real-time color                     
              images, and measurements of the spatial-averaged surface                       
              temperature and surface temperature spectra for selected                       
              configurations.
