Abstract    :
                 This research project examines some of the basic high level                 
              computer vision problems associated with the task of manipulating              
              and assembling structural frames under autonomous visual control.              
              The approach treats high level vision as uncertain inference.                  
              Uncertainties arising from the sensing process and scene itself                
              are explicitly represented and resolved with prior knowledge at a              
              high level of abstraction.  The uncertain inference process are                
              realized as a parallel network, based on a Markov Random Field                 
              formalism.  The structure assembly domain focuses attention on                 
              geometric reasoning about spatial relationships between parts,                 
              particularly in the presence of uncertainty.  Finally, the                     
              assembly task provides a functional goal that can define criteria              
              for deciding when too much uncertainty is present.  This provides              
              a rationale for planning and acquiring new images in an active                 
              framework.  This research could have a significant impact on the               
              flexibility of future computer vision systems, and may also                    
              increase our understanding of human high level vision.
