              resonance (ECR) plasma reactors have                                           
              demonstrated excellent potential in                                            
              etching and thin-film deposition

              of ECR plasma processing technology                                            
              requires that the operation of the                                             
              reactors be better understood and                                              
              characterized.  This Research
