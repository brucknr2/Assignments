Abstract    :
              This project aims to explain why some lifesaving interventions are             
              implemented in the United States while others are not.  Findings               
              should prove useful to decision makers who are responsibe for                  
              promoting the implementation of lifesaving interventions.                      
              The proposal calls for                                                         
              (1) Identifying 300 lifesaving interventions in the fields of                  
              medicine, consumer product safety, transportation safety,                      
              environmental protection, and occupational safety and health that              
              have been analyzed for cost-effectiveness.                                     
              (2) Collecting data on the extent to which these interventions are             
              currently implemented in the United States, the primary dependent              
              variable under study.                                                          
              (3) Collecting data on economic, psychological and political                   
              variables that theory suggests may explain the extent of                       
              implementation.                                                                
              (4) Incorporating this information into a computerized database to             
              be managed at the Harvard Center for RIsk Analysis,                            
              (5) Estimating an explanatory model using a variety of statistical             
              methods.                                                                       
              (6) Publishing two papers, one describing the HCRA database and one            
              reporting the results of the explanatory model.
