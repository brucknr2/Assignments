Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to collect a one-month time series of dissipation               
              rates of kinetic and potential energy in the ocean's upper 300 m in            
              the Western Pacific Warm Pool. Supporting atmospheric observations             
              as well as temperature and salinity profiles will also be collected            
              in order to parameterize mixing as a function of physical forcing.             
              The observations will take place in late 1992 to early 1993 during             
              the Intensive Observation Period (IOP) of the Tropical Ocean Global            
              Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA                  
              COARE). The goal of the experiment is to understand and describe               
              the oceanic response to Westerly wind bursts and rainfall.
