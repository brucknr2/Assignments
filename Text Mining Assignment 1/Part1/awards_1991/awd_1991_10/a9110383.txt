Abstract    :
                   Biological diversity within and among species can contain                 
              genetic, physical, behavioral, and cultural variation.  Most                   
              organisms show geographic variation of these kinds, and tolerate               
              a diverse array of ecological conditions.  While biological                    
              diversity is of interest to a broad group of people, few actually              
              study the geographic patterns of that variation or the processes               
              which give rise to it or maintain it.  The deserts of western                  
              North America hold an enormous amount of biological diversity, as              
              measured by the number of species.  The 24 species of kangaroo                 
              rats are one clear example of this diversity.  These seed-eating               
              kangaroo-shaped rodents are divisible into over 110                            
              geographically distinct forms.  This is based simply on their                  
              appearance.  Variation in genetic material, behavior, ecology,                 
              and life history will be studied using cytological and molecular               
              techniques.  A understanding of that variation and studies of the              
              processes which produce and maintain that variation will enable                
              us to understand some of the biological diversity which comprises              
              our natural heritage.
