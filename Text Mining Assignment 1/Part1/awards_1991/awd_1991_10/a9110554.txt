Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to instrument a surface meteorological buoy with                
              temperature sensors and an acoustic current profiler between 30 and            
              300 m to measure the structure of the upper ocean in the Western               
              Pacific Warm Pool. The observations will take place in late 1992 to            
              early 1993 during the Intensive Observation Period (IOP) of the                
              Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response             
              Experiment (TOGA COARE). The goal of the experiment is to                      
              understand and describe the oceanic response to Westerly wind                  
              bursts and rainfall.
