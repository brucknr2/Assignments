Abstract    :
              This research is on layout problems in ultra-large-scale-                      
              integration (ULSI).  The nature of the multichip module (MCM)                  
              layout problem and associated design problems are being                        
              investigated.  Activities include:  (1) Exploring MCM layout by                
              characterizing the physical requirements posed by MCM technology.              
              Layout models for the MCM design problem are being built.  Physical            
              constraints being included in the model are:  functions of layers              
              (signal, power-ground, redistribution), layer ordering, wire width             
              and separation, and grid-gridless geometry.  The differences                   
              between MCM layout and traditional IC layout are being considered.             
              (2) Finding techniques to decompose a 3-D MCM layout problem into              
              a set of single layer layout problems.  (3) Designing efficient                
              algorithms for the MCM layout problem and incorporating performance            
              requirements into the algorithms.  Layer minimization, performance             
              and global routing are being addressed.
