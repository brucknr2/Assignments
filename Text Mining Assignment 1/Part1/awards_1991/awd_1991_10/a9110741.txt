Abstract    :
              This research initiation grant will develop a computer graphics                
              system to analyze the potential outcome of hip replacement                     
              surgery.  The thrust of the work is to incorporate a geometric                 
              model of a hip prosthesis into a model of the human lower limb                 
              and to determine how the prosthesis design and surgical procedure              
              affect post-surgical hip muscle strength.  The project emphasizes              
              general principles rather than the planning of surgery for                     
              specific individuals.  The research is expected to provide an                  
              interactive system that is useful for the planning of surgery and              
              for teaching the biomechanical principles of surgical procedures.
