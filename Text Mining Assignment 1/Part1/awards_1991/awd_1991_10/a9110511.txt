Abstract    :
              The research is on chip-to-chip and on-chip interconnection                    
              problems.  General formulations and efficient solutions to these               
              problems are being explored.  The focus is large chip/system                   
              designs with over a million transistors.  Algorithms which minimize            
              the interconnection delay and maximize circuit performance are                 
              being developed.  Topics being addressed are:  (1) timing driven               
              global routing with bounded routing costs for both cell-based                  
              designs and building-block designs; (2) high-speed clock routing               
              with minimum skew for cell-based and building-block designs; and               
              (3) chip-to-chip interconnection problems for multichip packaging,             
              including multilayer planer subset, multilayer via minimization,               
              and transmission line problems.
