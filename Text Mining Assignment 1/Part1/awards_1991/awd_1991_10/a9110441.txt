Abstract    :
              This research is on modeling faulty neural networks using a fault              
              polynomial representation to facilitate the creation of a Markov               
              model.  The initial method has the capability of analyzing neural              
              networks with about twelve neurons.  This research extends the                 
              technique to allow the analysis of a neural network with several               
              hundred neurons.  Other related research objectives include                    
              studying different fault models, fault analysis accuracy, related              
              disciplines for analysis techniques, dynamic behavior measurements,            
              other neuron models, learning, and different neural network                    
              architectures.  Digital computer techniques are used to compute and            
              verify the results.  This research allows the faulty behavior of               
              neural networks to be analyzed.  It provides a motivation for                  
              implementing neural networks with a large numbers of neurons.  It              
              also models some aspects of the dynamic behavior of such neural                
              networks.
