Abstract    :
              An interdisciplinary research program in the area of intelligent               
              materials systems and adaptive structures will be developed, with              
              the primary focus being the development of the fundamental science             
              base necessary for the implementation of this technology in U.S.               
              applications.  During the initial program period,                              
              electrorheological (ER) materials and their usage in applications              
              will be studied.  Theoretical efforts in the areas of ER material              
              rheology, ER material pre-yield adaptive structures, and ER                    
              material post-yield adaptive devices will be performed.  All                   
              initial efforts will be extensions of research by the present                  
              investigator while the previously employed at Lord Corporation.                
              Further development of a microscopic model of ER material behavior             
              will be completed, and the rheological response of state-of-the-art            
              ER formulations will be simulated.  Knowledge of pre-yield behavior            
              will be utilized in a study of ER material adaptive structures,                
              during which a structural response theory will be further                      
              developed.  Rheological information related to post-yield response             
              will be coupled to the development of an improved theory for ER                
              material controllable device performance.  The overall impact of               
              the investigation will be possible, the improvement of the                     
              fundamental theoretical understanding of ER materials and their                
              usage in applications.
