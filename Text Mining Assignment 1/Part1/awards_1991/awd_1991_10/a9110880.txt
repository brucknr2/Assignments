Abstract    :
              The major strength of relational databases lies in their ability               
              to process data in a set-at-a-time manner.  An important                       
              drawback, however, is their inability to handle rules.                         
              Aninformation system must allow users to define, represent and                 
              manipulate rules just as easily as data and treat them in a                    
              common framework.  Such a system is called a knowledge-based                   
              system.  The objective of this research is to investigate the                  
              feasibility of developing such a framework for integrating rules               
              and data within a relational database system. This research                    
              develops and evaluates techniques for integration in this manner,              
              and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of such an approach.               
              Consequently, it focuses on the following issues: extending a                  
              relational language like SQL to express rules, storing and                     
              manipulating rules in an efficient manner, developing query                    
              processing algorithms (this will also involve designing new data               
              structures), implementing the algorithms and evaluating their                  
              performance.  This work draws to a large extent on existing                    
              literature and theory in the area of relational database systems,              
              deductive databases, and also on existing work in the areas of                 
              artificial intelligence and expert systems.  The findings will be              
              useful for the designers of next-generation database systems.
