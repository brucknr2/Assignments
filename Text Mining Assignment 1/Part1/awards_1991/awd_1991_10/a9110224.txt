Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award will be used to study the epitaxy,              
              stress and interface structure which develop during the initial                
              stages of layer growth in sputtered thin films of alternating metal            
              pairs.  Growth conditions and metal systems will be chosen to                  
              provide systematic variation in interface dynamics, lattice misfit,            
              and growth kinetics.  Initial work will concentrate on the Ni/Mo               
              system for which sudden onset of crystallinity has been observed               
              and which shows large coherency stresses.
