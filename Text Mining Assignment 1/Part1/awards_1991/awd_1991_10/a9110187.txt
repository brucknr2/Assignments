Abstract    :
              This proposal will develop algorithms, based on constrained                    
              optimization, for removing blur from or sharpening star field                  
              intensity, and will evaluate the performance of these new                      
              algorithms through analytical and comparative studies.  The novelty            
              of this approach lies in the use of the 1p quasinorm (p < 1) for               
              measuring image sparseness in the optimization constraint(s).
