Abstract    :
              This award is to fund a workshop on research needs in human-                   
              computer interaction to be held March 4-5 at the George                        
              Washington University, Washington, D.c.  The general need for                  
              high quality research in human-computer interaction (HCI) is                   
              becoming more and more evident both in industrial and academic                 
              settings.  This workshop has a primary purpose to establish an                 
              agenda for research in this critical area.  The workshop brings                
              together almost two dozen of the most prominent HCI researches                 
              from the disciplines of computer science, engineering,                         
              information science, psychology and human factors along with NSF               
              staff members.  The results of the workshop is a report                        
              identifying critical research issues and potential avenues for                 
              studying them, along with necessary infrastructure                             
              recommendations related to educational, professional and facility              
              problems.  The report will be published in major distribution                  
              publications.
