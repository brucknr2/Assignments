Abstract    :
              Roots in nature produce an astonishing variety of                              
              secondary metabolites, many of which have been used as                         
              pharmaceuticals, pesticides, flavors, fragrances, etc.  A                      
              recent experimental system, "hairy root" cultures obtained                     
              by transformation with Agrobacterium rhizogenes, has been                      
              developed and become a useful tool for understanding basic                     
              root biology.  The "hairy root" approach also has several                      
              advantages over other plant tissue culture systems for the                     
              production of plant chemicals: fast-growth as organized                        
              cultures, higher and stable yields of secondary                                
              metabolites, production of both intra- and extracellular                       
              metabolites, and direct amenability to genetic                                 
              engineering.  The goal of this proposal is to integrate                        
              expertise in the biological and engineering sciences                           
              towards the development of commercially viable plant root                      
              systems.
