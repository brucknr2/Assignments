Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Vision involves capturing the energy of light by                               
              photopigment molecules in the eye; these photopigments are                     
              incorporated into elaborate membrane structures within                         
              photoreceptor cells.  These membranes often show high rates of                 
              turnover during time, and the mechanisms remain unclear for how                
              these organized membranes, incorporating high amounts of                       
              photopigment proteins, are formed and regulated.                               
                                                                                             
              This project uses as a model system the compound eye of an                     
              insect, the moth Manduca.  This organism is already a model for                
              developmental and physiological studies.  The pathway and                      
              regulation of membrane assembly and photopigment insertion can                 
              be separated experimentally.  Ultrastructural, biochemical,                    
              immunocytochemical, and electrophysiological techniques will be                
              used for examining the mechanisms and significance of turnover                 
              in this nocturnal insect with a complex visual system.  This                   
              Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project with a novel              
              approach will have an impact on visual science, and also will be               
              important for its impact on training undergraduates in modern                  
              neuroscience.
