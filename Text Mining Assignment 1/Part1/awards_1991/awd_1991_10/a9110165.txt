Abstract    :
                   Professor Mirkovic will study the representation theory of                
              real reductive groups using the ideas of perverse sheaves and D-               
              modules.  His program involves a number of projects, among them                
              an attempt to prove a conjecture of Vogan involving                            
              characteristic cycles and a study of analytic localization of                  
              representations.                                                               
                        Group theory is basically the theory of symmetry.  To                
              take a simple example, when the system in question is invariant                
              under a change in the position of the origin of space, the group               
              of translations naturally arises.  While groups are abstract                   
              objects, particular situations demand concrete realizations or                 
              "representations" of the symmetry group.
