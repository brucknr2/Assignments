Abstract    :
              This proposal describes a workshop, "Advanced Techniques for in                
              situ Studies of Zooplankton abundance, Distribution, and Behavior,             
              "that will be held at Lake Lacawac, NE Pennsylvania, during                    
              May 23-25, 1991.  The goals of the workshop are:  (1) to provide               
              a forum for interaction among biologists who are developing new                
              instruments for studying zooplankton in the field; and (2) to                  
              publish a collection of papers that describe instrument development            
              progress to date.  This proposal describes the workshop, the people            
              who have been invited, and the relationship of the workshop to                 
              other research.  Substantial workshop funding has been provided by             
              the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  We request supplementary funding             
              from NSF to enable key scientists from overseas to attend the                  
              workshop and share their knowledge with U.S. and Canadian                      
              scientists.
