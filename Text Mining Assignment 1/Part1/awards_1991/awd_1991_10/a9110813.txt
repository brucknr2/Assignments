Abstract    :
              Increased intelligence and flexibility in a distributed database               
              system are achieved in this project using new automated reasoning              
              algorithms.  In particular, concurrency control is done by                     
              logical analysis of updates and queries to determine whether they              
              conflict.  The specific focus of the project is the design and                 
              implementation of a new database system that is fully distributed              
              in the sense that neither concurrency control nor any other                    
              function are necessarily performed at a central site.  Fully                   
              distributed concurrency control is achieved by explicit agreement              
              between sites as to which transactions may proceed, which should               
              be delayed, and which should be restarted.  Explicit common                    
              knowledge of active transactions allows the system to adapt                    
              heuristically to changing patterns of access to the shared                     
              database.  This explicit common knowledge is achieved by                       
              syntactic and semantic reasoning about queries and updates at                  
              individual sites which then execute a distributed consensus                    
              algorithm to share their conclusions.  OPTIONAL:  The algorithms               
              for reasoning about query and update conflict are based on a                   
              comprehensive theory of query and update independence developed                
              recently by the principal investigator.
