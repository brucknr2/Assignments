Abstract    :
              This project focuses on assessing the influence of nonlinearities              
              on the dynamical behavior of rotating flexible bladed disk/shaft               
              systems.  Such systems are affected in a nonlinear sense by blade              
              material, support mechanisms, and clearance.  The research goal                
              is to determine the impact of these nonlinearities on                          
              turbomachinery design.  Previous work in nonlinear rotordynamics               
              has concentrated separately on shaft vibration or on blade                     
              vibration, and has neglected coupling dynamics between them.                   
              Furthermore, work in this area typically consists of perturbation              
              analyses which is valid only for motion about some operating                   
              point.  In this project, nonlinear models are be developed and                 
              their global dynamical behavior are be explored.  Experimental                 
              verification of the analytical work is included in this work.
