Abstract    :
              The object of this proposal is to investigate the effect                       
              of gravel-sized particles on the liquefaction resistance                       
              of gravelly-sand specimens. The goal is to show                                
              quantitatively how the liquefaction potential of sand is                       
              effected by inclusion of gravel particles. Since sand is                       
              readily accepted as liquefiable bu most engineers, the                         
              liquefaction potential of several gravelly soils will be                       
              compared to that of sand. Case histories and dynamic                           
              laboratory testing will be used to show that gravelly soil                     
              is liquefiable.
