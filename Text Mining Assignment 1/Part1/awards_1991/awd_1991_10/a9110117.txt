Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative: This proposal will continue the joint India-U.S.          
              research program in theoretical astrophysics begun in 1987 between the         
              Tata Institute and the University of Chicago.  Dr. S. M. Chitre of the         
              Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay, India and Dr. David            
              Schramm of the University of Chicago are the co-principal inves-               
              tigators.  The main focus of the program is nuclear astrophysics with          
              a fitting  emphasis in the past three years on the supernova that              
              occurred on February 23, 1987 (SN1987A).  For a field that has been            
              theoretically dominated in the past, this event has added a new                
              dimension through the observations that have occurred, especially in           
              the Large Magellanic Cloud.  The proposed studies of the supernova             
              are expected to address the following issues: 1) How does a type II            
              supernova explode? 2) What are the number, orbital period distribution         
              and mass ratios of binary stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud? 3) How          
              many pulsars are there in the galactic globular cluster systems and            
              what is their evolutionary origin?  The proposed research will                 
              address also the recent interest in the role of the quark-hadron               
              phase transition in the early universe, and ultra-high energy cosmic           
              ray interactions.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Scope: The two scientists who are eminent in the field in their                
              respective countries plan to continue their collaboration in                   
              theoretical astrophysics studying nuclear structure in the early               
              universe and in a contemporary high energy environment, the massive            
              stars that explode as supernovae.  Specifically, the focus is nuclear          
              astrophysics, supernovae, and the quark-hadron transition in the               
              early universe.  The results of advances in this field are wide-               
              ranging in the understanding of the physics of matter, astronomy and           
              astrophysics.
