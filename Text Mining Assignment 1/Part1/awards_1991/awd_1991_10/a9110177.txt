Abstract    :
              Developing error-free distributed software and coping with processor           
              failures are among the important problems encountered in the                   
              development of reliable distributed systems.  The main objective of            
              this research is to design and build reliable distributed systems by           
              software testing and recovering from processor failures.                       
              The analytical component of this research is expected to provide a             
              better understanding of the issues involved and suggest different              
              approaches to testing distributed programs and crash recovery.  The            
              experimental component of this research effort involves the                    
              implementation of several techniques and is expected to result in the          
              development of software tools for the above mentioned problems in              
              distributed computing systems.
