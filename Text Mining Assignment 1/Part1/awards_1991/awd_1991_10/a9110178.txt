Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is basic research in the                         
              development of an intelligent learning sensor model.  Intelligent              
              control systems provide functions beyond conventional control                  
              systems, including learning and expert decision making.  Each                  
              intelligent sensor, within a control system, will possess those                
              aspects of intelligence appropriate to its function, and this                  
              intelligence will operate only on information available to the                 
              sensor.  Intelligent sensors will be modeled as objects in an                  
              object oriented programming environment, where properties and                  
              functions of generic intelligent sensors are inherited by more                 
              specific sensor objects.  The object oriented approach provides a              
              means of isolating sensor specific code in the object                          
              representing that sensor and a knowledge base that can make the                
              sensor self educated and self organized.  The model of the                     
              intelligent sensor will be created, in first instance, as an                   
              empty structure where the various aspects that define the model                
              will be filled as the work progresses.  The research will                      
              specifically develop the aspect of learning as an essential                    
              functional characteristic of the intelligent sensor.  Two other                
              characteristics, interpretation and estimation, have been                      
              extensively researched and will be directly implemented as part                
              of the model.  Models of intelligent ultrasonic and temperature                
              sensors will be created for experimental verification. //
