Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The primary objective of this research is to apply a promising new             
              algorithm for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to a distributed              
              memory parallel computer.  The long range goal is to significantly             
              increase the size of flow problems of industrial significance that             
              can be routinely simulated on affordable, high-performance machines.           
              The chosen CFD algorithm , called BLIMM for Block-Implicit Multigrid           
              Method, has been shown to be very efficient for solving                        
              recirculating, incompressible flows on meshes with large numbers of            
              grid points.   The algorithm is based on the control-volume finite-            
              difference method, which is the basis of several commercial and                
              industrial CFD codes.//
