Abstract    :
              At the heart of this proposal is the very difficult X-ray                      
              crystallography reconstruction problem - given the magnitude of the            
              Fourier transform of the electron density of a crystal, reconstruct            
              the electron density, and, hence, determine the locations of the               
              atoms of the molecule to be imaged.  The major theme is a new                  
              statistical approach based on Markov random fields which promises              
              to permit easier and more effective incorporation of prior                     
              information such as the possible locations of the atoms, and on the            
              valence structure of the bonds, and a more consistent use of                   
              statistical information.  Methods which will be developed during               
              the course of this investigation will be useful in other contexts              
              such as pattern recognition and nonconvex optimization.
