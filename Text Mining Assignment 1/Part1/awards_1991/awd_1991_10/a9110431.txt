Abstract    :
                   This project, administered by the Association for Women in                
              Mathematics, provides travel support for women to attend research              
              conferences in the mathematical sciences.  The project would                   
              allow partial travel support for approximately 80 travel awards                
              over a three year period.  This travel support would enhance the               
              research activities of the awardees and would provide increased                
              visibility for women in the mathematical sciences which may help               
              in addressing the problem of under-representation in the                       
              discipline.
