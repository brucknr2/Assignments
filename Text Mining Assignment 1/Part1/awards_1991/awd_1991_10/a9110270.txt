Abstract    :
                 The objective of this project is the integration of vision and              
              force feedback for the synthesis and execution of error-tolerant               
              robot motion plans.  Specifically, a purely geometric                          
              representation of visual constraints in terms of visual                        
              constraint surfaces is explored.  A visual constraint surface is               
              a ruled surface defined by an object feature (such as an edge)                 
              and its projection onto the image plans of a supervisory camera.               
              Control schemes are planned to facilitate:  motion that complies               
              to a visual constraint surface; motion that terminated on contact              
              with a visual constraint surface; and, motion that is                          
              simultaneously constrained by visual and physical constraint                   
              surfaces.  Extensions to existing preimage style motion planners               
              will make possible the synthesis of motion plans that exploit                  
              execution-time feedback from vision and force sensors.  While                  
              much work has been done in the areas of motion planning and                    
              control with force feedback and motion control using visual                    
              feedback, to date there has been no reported system capable of                 
              creating motion plans based on visual feedback or capable of                   
              integration of both force and vision sensing for motion control.               
              This research addresses each of these issues.
