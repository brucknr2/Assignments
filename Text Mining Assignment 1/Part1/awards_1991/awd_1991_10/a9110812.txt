Abstract    :
              The architecture of future teraflop computers is under intense study           
              in universities, government and industrial laboratories.  The                  
              objective of this research is to model parallel applications on some           
              of the recently available commercial architectures.  The goal is to            
              develop performance modeling methods that will scale to future                 
              machines.  Performance evaluation of parallel computer systems and             
              applications running on these systems is a complex task because of             
              the large number of execution parameters involved.  This project               
              investigates the use of robust modeling techniques based on neural             
              networks to analyze the data and predict performance on current as             
              well as future machines.  This analysis will also be useful in                 
              providing information about the relevant measurements to be stored for         
              useful prediction.
