Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research investigates two areas of ceramic corrosion, gaseous             
              reactions with the production of volatile species and aqueous                  
              dissolution kinetics.  The objective is to determine the                       
              degradation mechanism and the rate-controlling steps in each case.             
              The range of possible mechanisms spans from transport control to               
              surface reaction kinetics.  Degradation of microstructure during               
              the oxidation of multi-component systems will be investigated.                 
              Gaseous corrosion kinetics are determined by thermogravimetry, and             
              dissolution kinetics are determined by solution analysis with                  
              atomic absorption spectroscopy.

              This research seeks to study the fundamentals governing the                    
              corrosion behaviors of ceramics.  From the degradation mechanism,              
              better ceramics can be fabricated to minimize degradation.  They               
              can also provide basis for the selection of an optimum ceramic                 
              material for a given hostile environment.  Results may also be                 
              useful with respect to ceramic processings.
