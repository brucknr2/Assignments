Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is for the development of advanced electron                      
              microscopy techniques and their use in material science. Specific              
              techniques of interest are in-line holography in a scanning                    
              transmission electron microscope (STEM) and high-angle annular                 
              dark-field (HAADF) STEM imaging. In-line holography promises to be             
              a feasible means to enhance STEM resolution without the requirement            
              of higher accelerating voltage. HAADF imaging will be well suited              
              to study crystal defects and surface layers. In particular, the                
              above techniques will be applied to studying ferroelectric domain              
              structures in thin crystals of barium titanate. The results of this            
              research are expected to have a major impact on our ability to                 
              characterize technologically important material systems.
