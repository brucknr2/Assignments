Abstract    :
                   The proposed project will investigate the kinetics of calcite             
              and dolomite precipitation at temperatures between 100 and 300oC               
              and corresponding hydrostatic pressures (about 300 to 1000 atm).               
              This project will be a significant contribution to understanding               
              burial diagenesis and hydrothermal alteration of carbonate rocks               
              because it will provide a systematic database for rates of calcite             
              and dolomite precipitation (and dolomitization of calcite) at high             
              temperatures and pressures.  A planning grant is necessary to 1)               
              refine the high temperature and pressure continuous-flow-stirred               
              reactor system which will be used for the experiments; 2) conduct              
              preliminary experiments to determine the optimal combinations of               
              flow rate, chemical compositions of initial fluids, and seed masses            
              for a given precipitation rate; 3) collect preliminary data on the             
              magnitude of kinetic effects of each fluid parameter.
