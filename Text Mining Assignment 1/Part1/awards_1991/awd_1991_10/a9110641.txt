Abstract    :
              This MacroROA grant, supported by the Analytical and Surface                   
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, supports summer                   
              research by small-college faculty at the University of Kansas.                 
              It is unique in its focus on bioanalytical chemistry.                          
              Continued contact with former participants further encourages                  
              improvement in undergraduate research at these 4-year                          
              institutions.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              Four-year college faculty will enhance their research skills in                
              the area of bioanalytical chemistry by participating in this                   
              MacroROA program, supported by the Analytical and Surface                      
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.  By maintaining                   
              follow-up contact after the summer's work, continued                           
              collaborations, intellectual support, and networking will be                   
              enhanced.
