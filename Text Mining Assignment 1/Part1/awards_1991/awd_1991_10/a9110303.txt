Abstract    :
              This is a joint seminar proposed by Drs. John Kennedy and Witold               
              F. Krajewski, University of Iowa, and Professor Chin-Lien Yen,                 
              National Taiwan University supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA                 
              (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  The seminar will discuss                
              the use of modern meteorological observation systems (e.g.                     
              satellites and radar) and computer models for predicting and                   
              forecasting natural disasters such as hurricanes, rain, floods,                
              and landslides, and exchange techniques for controlling and                    
              mitigating potential damages.  Natural hazard mitigation is an                 
              important topic both for the U.S. and Asia.  Damages caused by                 
              floods and landslides are an extremely serious concern in the                  
              Pacific Rim region.  This conference provides an opportunity for               
              the U.S. scientists to work with scientists from Taiwan to set                 
              research priorities in this field.  Advances in prediction and                 
              mitigation of natural hazard can greatly reduce property damage                
              and human casualties.
