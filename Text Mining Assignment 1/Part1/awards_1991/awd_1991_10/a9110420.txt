Abstract    :
              HeII (superfluid helium), the low temperature phase of liquid                  
              helium existing below 2.2 K, has numerous technical                            
              applications.  Because of its unique properties, namely                        
              extremely high heat conductivity and in some cases vanishing                   
              viscosity, He II is the preferred coolant for a variety of low                 
              temperature devices, including superconducting magnet systems                  
              and space based cryogenic facilities.  An understanding of                     
              basic HeII heat transfer mechanisms is important for these                     
              applications.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This project addresses this need through analytical and                        
              experimental studies of HeII in parallel and counterflow heat                  
              exchangers.  The analytical work consists of obtaining                         
              solutions to the HeII energy equation applied to two forced                    
              flow HeII channels thermally coupled by a heat exchange                        
              surface.  Experimental measurements are required to benchmark                  
              the analytical work as well as to provide quantitative values                  
              for physical parameters, particularly the Kapitza conductance.                 
              The primary measurements consist of temperature profiles                       
              within the flowing HeII contained on both sides of a                           
              parallel/counterflow heat exchanger.  Heat exchanger                           
              length-to-diameter ratio, fluid velocity and bath temperature                  
              are varied to obtain a range of parameters necessary for                       
              developing correlations.  Although the immediate goal of the                   
              work is a comparison of analytical results with experimental                   
              measurements, a secondary purpose is to develop a design                       
              procedure for HeII parallel/counterflow heat exchangers using                  
              correlations or other empirical expressions derived from our                   
              fundamental studies.
