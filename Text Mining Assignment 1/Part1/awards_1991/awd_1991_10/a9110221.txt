Abstract    :
              This proposed research is for the investigation of                             
              the integration of novel III-V semiconductor                                   
              heterostructure electronic devices with III-V                                  
              semiconductor light emitting devices.  This will be                            
              applied research with an emphasis on making III-V                              
              semiconductor logic devices compatible with III-V                              
              light emitter technology, with the ultimate goal                               
              being an integrated logic device/light emitter for                             
              use in optically interconnected integrated circuits.                           
              Within this broad category emphasis will be focused                            
              on an specific category of devices.  Specifically, the                         
              combining of the negative resistance field effect                              
              transistor (NERFET) with the heterostructure laser                             
              to form a compact, vertically integrated light                                 
              emitter for digital data transmission applications,                            
              will be investigated.
