Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to analyze the effects on market                
              prices and market efficiency of learning on the part of individuals            
              participating in that market.  There is good evidence that                     
              suppliers and demanders eventually learn enough about the market               
              to form rational expectations about the market they participant in,            
              in the sense that they do not persist in making predictable errors             
              that reduces market efficiency.  The way in which market                       
              participants learn about a market can affect its efficiency; first             
              by affecting how quickly participants learn about the market, and              
              second by affecting equilibrium prices and quantities.  An                     
              important part of learning about a market is learning about other              
              suppliers and demanders in the market.  This project will analyze              
              learning by the use of experimental markets in which suppliers                 
              determine output before any trades occur.  This production before              
              sale situation mimics agricultural markets as well as many other               
              markets in which supplies' forecasts of market prices have an                  
              important effect on market prices.  The most precise learning                  
              models are the statistically-based models of Bayesian learning and             
              regression learning.  In this study the implications of both types             
              of learning are examined.  This research is important because it               
              will give us a better understanding of how learning affects the                
              efficient functioning of markets.
