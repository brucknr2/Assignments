Abstract    :
                   The objective of the research is to determine the stability               
              characteristics of multi-layer internal flows in configurations                
              relevant to coextrusion processes.  The primary interest is to                 
              study the effect of non-parallel channel walls on the two                      
              mechanisms for instability:  the mechanism associated with the                 
              presence of fluid-fluid interfaces and the mechanism associated                
              with the presence of solid walls.  The baseline geometry to be                 
              studied is a two-dimensional channel consisting of two constant                
              width sections joined by a converging section.  The stability of               
              steady isothermal flow of three layers of Newtonian fluids of                  
              different viscosities and densities will be examined using local               
              linear analysis, global linear analysis, and direct numerical                  
              simulation.  The direct numerical simulation will be based on time-            
              accurate integration of the spectrally discretized (spectral                   
              elements) full unsteady Navier-Stokes equation.  The study will be             
              extended to non-Newtonian fluids and will incorporate thermal                  
              effects.  The long term goal of the project is the development of              
              a reliable method for the (1) prediction of stability                          
              characteristics of coextrusion processes and (2) design testing,               
              and analysis of coextrusion dies.                                              
                   The research will lead to improved manufacturing process for              
              coextrusion of polymers.
