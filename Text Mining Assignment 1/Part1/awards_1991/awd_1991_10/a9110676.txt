Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The ability of the retina to regenerate in amphibians, teleosts                
              and embryonic chicks is a particularly striking example of                     
              central nervous system repair following traumatic damage.  In                  
              chick, the source of new retinal neural precursor cells in the                 
              regenerative process has been identified as the retinal pigmented              
              epithelium.   However, with increasing development the pigmented               
              epithelium of the chick embryo loses its ability to generate                   
              neuronal cells.  To study molecular mechanisms underlying this                 
              transdifferentiation and loss of regenerative capacity, the                    
              embryonic chick pigmented epithelium will be studied in a tissue               
              culture system.  The role of the extracellular matrix molecules,               
              laminin and basic fibroblast growth factor, on                                 
              transdifferentiation will be studied. Neuronal cells will be                   
              identified with antibodies to neuron specific markers.  In                     
              addition, the polymerase chain reaction will be used to determine              
              whether the GAP-43 or neurofilament genes are expressed.  It also              
              will be determined whether pigmented epithelium loses its                      
              regenerative capacity in the in vitro system.  In addition, the                
              expression of neuronal phenotype will be studied in relation to                
              the expression of two chick genes that are homologous to the                   
              neural determination genes of the achaete scute complexes that                 
              play a role in neural determination in the fruit fly.  These                   
              studies have the potential for identifying genes that play a role              
              in the determination, as well as the regeneration, of retina.
