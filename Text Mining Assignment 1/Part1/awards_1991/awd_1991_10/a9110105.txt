Abstract    :
                   Research Planning Grants are one-time awards designed to help             
              increase the number of new women investigators participating in NSF            
              researchprograms, and to facilitate preliminary studies and other              
              activities related to the development of competitive NSF research              
              proposals.                                                                     
                   The project investigates the issues of call routing for                   
              integrated broadband networks in a multilayer control framework.               
              The Principal Investigator is developing models to predict the                 
              network performance, algorithms and software to achieve optimal                
              performance.  The study involves the following issues:                         
                   -How much bandwidth is required to satisfy a certain grade of             
                    service for the purposes of call admission and routing?                  
                   -How should the probability of blocking be quantified as a                
                    function                                                                 
                    of the current state and traffic statistics?                             
                   -For a given set of paths, how the calls should be routed                 
                    dynamically according to the degree of congestion of these               
                    paths.                                                                   
                   -Stability of such dynamic routing methods.                               
                   Markov decision theory is used in finding optimum routing                 
              policies.
