Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project examines two isolated (pre-contact) social systems,               
              testing derivations from an extension of world systems theory.                 
              The extension predicts that societies having less internal                     
              stratification (that is, more egalitarian societies) will develop              
              social institutions making them less susceptible to external                   
              conquest or domination.  Research focuses on two cases, Califor-               
              nia and Hawaii, both in the time before European contact.  Hawaii              
              at that time showed considerable stratification, and California,               
              almost none.  This project uses ethnographic records of the                    
              societies,  including records from interviews stored at Berkeley               
              and at the Smithsonian, and archaeological studies of the two                  
              regions.  Hypothesis testing requires deriving measures of                     
              concepts such as inter- and intra-societal hierarchies from                    
              anthropological and archaeological records.  Results of this                   
              research will improve theoretical understanding of conditions                  
              leading to hegemonic relations and the causes of institutions                  
              which preserve national independence.
