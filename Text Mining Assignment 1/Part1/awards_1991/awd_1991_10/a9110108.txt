Abstract    :
              Recently, considerable attention has been devoted to the theoretical           
              study of machine learning.  A primary goal of this research project is         
              to understand how changes in the learner's interaction with its                
              environment in an on-line model influence the complexity of learning.          
                                                                                             
              Previous work has shown that the complexity of learning depends on how         
              the instances (or examples) are selected.  The usual assumption is             
              that the adversary selects the instances, but this investigation will          
              center on alternative on-line models.  First, the situation will be            
              studies in which the learner selects the instances.  Part of this work         
              will be the development of a new model in which each query has a small         
              cost, yet each mistake has a large cost.  Such a model would favor             
              learning algorithms that make few mistakes while still requesting a            
              modest number of examples.  A second alternative is to have a teacher          
              perform the instance selection.  It is planned to formalize a model of         
              teaching that requires the teacher to find the best way to present             
              the lesson so that any student who "pays attention" learns the lesson.         
              This model, will be used to study the complexity of teaching.                  
              Variations of this model that place further restrictions on the                
              learner (without confining the learner to some particular algorithm)           
              will also be considered.
