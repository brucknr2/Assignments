Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A fundamental question in neurobiology is how the brain forms and              
              maintains memories.  One possibility is that neurochemical                     
              changes are involved.  To test this idea, Dr. Dluzen has designed              
              a clever series of studies that uses in vivo push-pull cannula                 
              system combined with state-of-the-art methods of detecting and                 
              identifying relevant neurochemicals.  He will measure specific                 
              neurotransmitters or their metabolites within discretely                       
              localized brain regions in freely behaving animals.  The animals               
              will perform a series of novel behavioral tasks that allow                     
              evaluation of the behavioral responses within the context of                   
              memory/recognition processes.  Moreover, Dr. Dluzen will examine               
              how hormones and previous social experiences modulate the                      
              behaviors and neurotransmitters.  Thus, his work will lead to a                
              better understanding of how neurochemical responses within                     
              specific brain regions are involved in the formation and                       
              maintenance of memories and recognition processes and how                      
              hormones and experience alter these memories.
