Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to lay the                                                  
              technological foundation for the                                               
              development of a state-of-the-art                                              
              digital hearing aid for individuals                                            
              with sensorineural hearing                                                     
              impairments, especially those                                                  
              accompanied by "recruitment of

              develop a digital signal processing                                            
              system to compress speech in order                                             
              to compensate for the problem.  The                                            
              scheme, based on a model that                                                  
              breaks speech into sinusoidal

              algorithm with frequency dependent                                             
              gains and thresholds for the

              research will have a significant
