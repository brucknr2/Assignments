Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to collect a one-month time series of detailed                  
              spectral profiles of light attenuation in the upper 250 m of the               
              Western Pacific Warm Pool as part of the Intensive Observation                 
              Period (IOP) of the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean             
              Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) that is to take place              
              in late 1992- early 1993. Supporting measurements of incident solar            
              radiation, surface wind, as well as water sample collection, will              
              be conducted to estimate the heat flux through the mixed layer.
