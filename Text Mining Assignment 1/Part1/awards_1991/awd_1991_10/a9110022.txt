Abstract    :
                   With recent advances in computing power and improved                      
              algorithms, it is now possible to model detailed features of solid-            
              state convection in the Earth's mantle.  The proposed project                  
              consists of s study of several aspects of upwelling thermal plumes             
              in the mantle.  A fully-vectorized, production finite-element code             
              has been developed to model convection in a spherical, axisymmetric            
              shell.  Part of this project involves participating in an extensive            
              benchmark of numerical models of mantle convection in spherical                
              shells.  The code will also be further developed to model the                  
              evolution of the core-mantle boundary and its effect on mantle                 
              plumes.  In addition, the effects of temperature-dependent rheology            
              and sphericity on the structure of thermal plumes in a spherical               
              shell will be studied.
