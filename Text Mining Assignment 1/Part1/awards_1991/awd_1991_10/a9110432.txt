Abstract    :
              This project under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research                   
              Program examines multicomponent extractive crystallization for                 
              systems with simple eutectic.  General separation schemes                      
              involving crystallizer and filters are developed based on                      
              detailed knowledge of phase diagrams at various temperatures.                  
              The goal is to avoid eutectic and produce pure products.  The                  
              separation schemes are tested experimentally with solutions of                 
              m-, o-, and p-xylenes, or adipic, glutaric, and succinic                       
              acids.  The results are applicable to separating and purifying                 
              products of several chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
