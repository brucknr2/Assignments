Abstract    :
              This research extends query language and user-interface                        
              technology to include context-based queries for image data. A                  
              context is a domain dependent body of knowledge which encodes the              
              translation between, on one hand, user-level semantics and object              
              classes and, on the other hand, database syntax and entities. A                
              prototype image information system provides a testbed for the                  
              investigation of issues in image indexing, similarity measures,                
              and knowledge-guided incremental querying. A set of image                      
              processing and feature extraction routines supplies the base for               
              image indexing; this base is augmented with a data model that                  
              accounts for objects, their images, the image features, and                    
              events in the world involving the objects. A knowledge-base and                
              associated user-interface support navigation within the data                   
              model to guide query formation and refinement. This research will              
              develop new concepts in data modeling, image indexing, and user-               
              interfaces, which will enable users to access the image data in                
              such applications as global monitoring and scientific imaging,                 
              based on concepts, context, similarity, and image features.
