Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will explore the role of the context provided by                 
              one sentence in recognition of the words in the following                      
              sentence during silent reading.  The experiments will investigate              
              specific characteristics of the preceeding sentence context that               
              might influence the recognition of individual words during                     
              reading.  Skilled adult readers will read simple sentences                     
              presented on a computer screen, and their eye movements will be                
              recorded as they read.  The research will use information from                 
              their eye movements and the time they take to name each word to                
              determine the influence of the context in which a word occurs on               
              the identification of that word.  The purpose of the research is               
              to develop a more complete model of how words are identified                   
              during skilled reading and to further our understanding of the                 
              reading process in general.  By understanding skilled reading, we              
              will be better equipped to evaluate reading disability, to assist              
              dyslexic and disabled readers trying to cope with their reading                
              problems, and to design methods of reading instruction and                     
              remediation.
