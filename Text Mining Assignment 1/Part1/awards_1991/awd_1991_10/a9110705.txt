Abstract    :
              The main goal of this project is to investigate the                            
              noise characteristics of a two-dimensional (2-D)                               
              electron gas in the presence of a strong electric                              
              field , i.e., when electrons are out of equilibrium                            
              with the lattice.  This topic is important because                             
              noise defines the sensitivity and reliability of                               
              semiconductor devices.  The miniaturization of                                 
              these devices will lead to an emphasis on 2-D as                               
              opposed to 3-D electron gas.  In the present work                              
              we will use the Boltzmann transport equation and                               
              the Monte Carlo method to simulate current                                     
              fluctuation (noise) in a 2-D electron gas.  By                                 
              calculating the time dependence of the current-                                
              current correlation function it is possible to                                 
              determine the current fluctuation and its frequency                            
              dependence.  Noise is defined by scattering                                    
              processes.  We will study the contribution of                                  
              localized and interface phonons to the noise.                                  
              Special attention will be paid to scattering by the                            
              electric potential of background and remote ionized                            
              impurities.  Capture by these impurity states and                              
              subsequent release will be examined; we expect that                            
              these processes will make major (and often                                     
              overwhelming) contributions to noise in the high                               
              electric field region.  Emphasis will be placed on                             
              the optimization of low-noise configurations for 2-D                           
              structures.
