Abstract    :
              This research is on testing large scale analog and mixed-signal                
              circuits.  There are two tasks being undertaken.  First is to                  
              develop a decomposition approach for testing large scale analog and            
              mixed-signal circuits.  A time domain decomposition method, which              
              does not break interconnections, is being explored.  It is based               
              on taking voltage measurements at partition points and formulating             
              new test equations at these nodes.  Thus measurement errors are                
              reduced to a local area and computations are performed in each                 
              subcircuit.  Second is to establish a test strategy for automatic              
              testing of large scale circuits.  A set of pre-test computations               
              to be done off-line during the design stage or before manufacturing            
              test is being developed.  Methods for extracting parameters during             
              test are being investigated.  A set of post-test computations using            
              the parameters extracted during the test is being developed.                   
              Software for doing the tests is being built and benchmark circuits             
              are being tested.
