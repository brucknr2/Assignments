Abstract    :
              H-infinity theory has been widely accepted for robust                          
              control system design to cope with the inaccurate                              
              description of the mathematical models.  However,                              
              there exist very few identification techniques which are                       
              compatible with current robust control design                                  
              methodologies.  The problem of system identification in                        
              H-infinity is thus formulated to obtain an identified                          
              system model with explicit upper bound on                                      
              identification error in H-infinity norm based on                               
              experimental information (noisy data).  This proposal                          
              aims to develop control oriented identification                                
              techniques in H-infinity framework for linear                                  
              time-invariant systems.  The proposed research will                            
              focus on following issues:                                                     
                                                                                             
              1.    Establish practical noise models which fit the                           
                    H-infinity framework;                                                    
              2.    Investigate the role of linear algorithms in                             
                    system identification;                                                   
              3.    Develop robustly convergent                                              
                    identification algorithms for different                                  
                    noise models with priori upper bounds                                    
                    for identification error in H-infinity                                   
                    norm;                                                                    
              4.    Optimize the performance of robustly                                     
                    convergent identification algorithms;                                    
              5.    Study system identification in H-infinity based                          
                    on experimental noisy time response data.                                
                                                                                             
              The ultimate goal of this proposal is to update                                
              identification techniques so that they are compatible                          
              with modern robust control methodologies.
