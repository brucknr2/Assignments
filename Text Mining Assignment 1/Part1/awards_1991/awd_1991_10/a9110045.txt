Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Arginine vasotocin and angiotensin II are antidiuretic                    
              hormones that influence water balance in many vertebrates.  Since              
              water is critical for survival, understanding how these hormones               
              enhance water-absorption is critical.  While most vertebrates                  
              have a regular and predictable water supply, desert animals live               
              in harsh conditions in which survival is dependent upon the                    
              ability to find, obtain and conserve water.  These species have                
              evolved mechanisms of water retention which allows them to                     
              survive under these uncharitable conditions.  Dr. Propper has                  
              selected two species that differ in genetic background but live                
              within the same austere environment.  She will employ a                        
              combination of behavioral, neuroanatomical and endocrine                       
              techniques to determine how these two neuropeptides influence                  
              water balance in two distinct desert species.  Dr. Propper will                
              define the behavioral responses to arginine vasotocin and                      
              angiotensin 11, localize the neural binding of these                           
              neuropeptides; and then determine how environmental changes                    
              influence the brain and plasma concentrations.  By comparing the               
              hormonal effects species that differ in their genetic background,              
              she can determine whether similar neuroendocrine mechanisms are                
              employed to manage water balance in vertebrates in general.
