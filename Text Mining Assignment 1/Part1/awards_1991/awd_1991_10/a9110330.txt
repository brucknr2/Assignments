Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                    Japanese industrial relations are often seen as being                   
              characterized by permanent employment, seniority wages, and a high             
              level of inequality between workers in large and small firms.                  
              These characteristics of the Japanese labor market may be vanishing            
              as Japan is becoming a highly industrialized, mass society.  If                
              that is the case, then it should have implications for the mobility            
              of workers within and between firms and for the level of earnings              
              inequality between workers in large and small firms.  This project             
              will address these issues by analyzing the Japanese Surveys of                 
              Social Stratification and Mobility from 1955, 1965, and 1975.                  
              These data span four decades of rapid industrialization and                    
              economic growth for Japan.  The investigator will use econometric              
              models to analyze the data.  He will examine whether between-firm              
              mobility of workers has become more common over time, and whether              
              the earnings determination process still is dominated by the                   
              existence of seniority wages.                                                  
                                                                                             
                   This study will be an important addition to the literature on             
              the Japanese labor market because it examines whether the rapid                
              industrialization and strong economic growth of the last four                  
              decades have replaced the practices of permanent employment and                
              seniority wages by productivity-based wage determination more                  
              similar to the patterns known from the American labor market.
