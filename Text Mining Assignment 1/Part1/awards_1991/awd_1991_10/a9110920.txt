Abstract    :
              Earlier work on the acoustic microcavitation in the water at                   
              low megahertz frequencies and low duty cycles strongly                         
              suggests that the fluid-borne submicronic particles can be                     
              acoustically coaxed to make their presence known.  The exact                   
              mechanism is not yet fully understood.  The measurements will                  
              reveal fluid/acoustic interactions at nanometer length scales.                 
              Experimental facility will be set up to investigate the                        
              phenomenon and look for control strategies that will make                      
              "acoustic coaxing" a viable technique.                                         
                                                                                             
              This will offer a new way of detecting, studying and                           
              understanding submicronic particulate presence even in ultra-                  
              clean liquids.  Further, unlike electron microscopy the                        
              technique will need no special sample preparation and unlike                   
              laser method the technique will not be blind in opaque                         
              environments.  Applications range from the detection of                        
              corrosion debris in the clean water for nuclear power plants                   
              to the particulate control in the nanometer regime for silicon                 
              chip industry.
