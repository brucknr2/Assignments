Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to theoretically                             
              analyze the effects of polarization mode dispersion                            
              (PMD) on various types of coherent optical                                     
              receivers.  The research will determine how the bit                            
              error rate depends on the transmitting and local                               
              laser spectral widths, the length of the optical                               
              transmission link, and the PMD properties of the                               
              fiber.  This will be important for the very long links                         
              that are now possible with fiber amplifiers.  The                              
              analysis will be performed on all major types of                               
              receivers that process polarization and polarization                           
              combined with phase or frequency.  This includes:                              
              1) polarization diversity  receivers using ASK, FSK                            
              and DPSK demodulation, with and without phase                                  
              diversity, 2) receivers that use polarization                                  
              controllers, and 3) receivers that do polarization                             
              demodulation.  Polarization mode dispersion is                                 
              defined as the difference in group delay between                               
              the two principal states of polarization of a fiber.                           
              The principal states are used as basis vectors in the                          
              analysis.  Stokes parameters are also used.
