Abstract    :
              Image compression is the process of reducing the amount of data                
              required to store or transmit an image.  It has traditionally been             
              done with little regard for image processing operations that may               
              precede or follow the compression step.  It is proposed to                     
              investigate areas in which image compression and image processing              
              may be combined into a single operation, and also areas in which               
              image compression may lead to improved or simpler image processing             
              operations.  Vector quantization algorithms for the compression of             
              halftoned binary images will be developed and images will be                   
              compared that are first compressed and then halftoned with images              
              that are halftoned and then compressed.  Vector quantizers that can            
              simultaneously perform both compression and image processing tasks             
              such as halftoning, inverse Fourier transforming, and contract                 
              enhancement will also be investigated.  This will lead to a                    
              reduction in computational complexity if the complexity of the                 
              compression step is less than that of the image processing                     
              operation.  Finally, examinations will be done to see if image                 
              compression will lead to simpler or improved image processing                  
              operations such as image segmentation, target detection, and pre-              
              screening for suspect regions in medical images.
