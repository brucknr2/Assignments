Abstract    :
              The purpose of this study is to analyze the stabilization of                   
              posture during stepping.  The research will combine experimental               
              and theoretical approaches.  Experiments on normal subjects will               
              measure ground reaction forces and the electrical activity of                  
              muscles using surface electrodes.  The mechanical system is                    
              described by a 3-dimensional mathematical model that has 8                     
              degrees of freedom; this model will be used for the                            
              interpretation of the experimental results.  The research will                 
              increase understanding of the stepping process, and may lead to                
              the improved design for functional electrical stimulation                      
              systems.  Such systems are being increasingly utilized in                      
              research to restore motility in paraplegic individuals.
