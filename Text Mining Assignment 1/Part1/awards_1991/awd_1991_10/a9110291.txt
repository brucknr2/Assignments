Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to develop a fracture                
              mechanics model of interfaces for measuring interface toughness.               
              Using this model, analytical and numerical analyses will be carried            
              out on an edge-cracked bimaterial specimen under various loading               
              conditions to provide the K-calibration relations, which are                   
              necessary for extracting toughness data from experimental                      
              measurements.  This research is essential for extracting interface             
              toughness data from experimental measurements, as well as for                  
              assessing the fracture toughness for a given structure containing              
              the same type of interface.  It can provide valuable information               
              for design, processing and failure prevention of engineering                   
              materials and structures, such as laminates, adhesives and solder              
              joints.
