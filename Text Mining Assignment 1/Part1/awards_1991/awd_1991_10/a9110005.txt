Abstract    :
              This research project is concerned with making and characterizing              
              thin epitaxial ferromagnetic films, heterostructures, multilayer               
              systems and superlattices.  Emphasis is placed on systems                      
              containing iron to permit Mossbauer spectroscopy, including                    
              measurements of the magnetic hyperfine field.  Work will be                    
              extended and completed on (100) and (110) iron films grown with                
              several other metals, including silver, nickel, manganese,                     
              chromium, copper, terbium, and gadolinium.  Special attention will             
              be devoted to interlayer magnetic  coupling studied by looking at              
              changes in the thermal spin-wave behavior of the systems.                      
              Characterization techniques for the systems include reflection high            
              energy electron diffraction, low energy electron diffraction, Auger            
              spectroscopy, x-ray measurements, scanning electron microscopy,                
              SQUID magnetometry, and Kerr effect magneto-optical analysis.
