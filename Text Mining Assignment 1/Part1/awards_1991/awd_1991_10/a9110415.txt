Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This project focuses on a working conference to coordinate                     
              the efforts of Historically Black Colleges and Universities                    
              (HBCUs) and other predominantly minority institutions in                       
              developing a national agenda to carry out major reforms that                   
              will improve mathematics, science and engineering education                    
              for minorities.  This effort will also eliminate the                           
              duplicative or fragmented efforts by the representative                        
              underrepresented groups who will be attending this                             
              conference.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              One measurable outcome of the conference will be the                           
              establishment of a comprehensive interactive network that                      
              will implement the action plan that results from the                           
              meeting.  Another important outcome will be the sharing of                     
              information and resources among the participating                              
              institutions as well as strengthening their linkages with                      
              industry, governmental units, and professional societies.                      
              The principal investigator has devoted much of her                             
              professional life to science and engineering issues for                        
              minorities, including leadership roles on several NSF                          
              advisory groups, and is therefore highly qualified to lead                     
              this important effort.
