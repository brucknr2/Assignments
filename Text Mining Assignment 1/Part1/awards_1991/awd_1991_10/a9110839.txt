Abstract    :
              Parallel computation has the potential for accelerating the solution           
              of combinatorial search problems.  Universal randomized methods, with          
              provably effective speed-up, have already been developed for parallel          
              backtrack search and parallel branch-and-bound computation.  Also              
              previously developed was a paradigm for parallelizing the sequential           
              alpha-beta pruning algorithm and its variants for evaluating game              
              trees.                                                                         
              This project continues work on the theory of parallel search                   
              algorithms, with the following objectives.  First, the performance of          
              the randomized methods will be analyzed for hypercube and butterfly            
              networks.  This analysis will demonstrate the effectiveness of the             
              algorithms in practice.  Second, network routing methods in which              
              messages are issued periodically and asynchronously will be studied,           
              since these methods provide a mechanism for implementing backtrack             
              search on networks.  Third, a new type of probabilistic performance            
              analysis, competitive analysis, will be applied to parallel                    
              algorithms.  Finally, experimental work on the proposed algorithms             
              will provide insight for the theoretical investigations.
