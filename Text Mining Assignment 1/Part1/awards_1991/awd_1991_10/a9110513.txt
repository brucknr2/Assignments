Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Conservation and management of species whose habitats are                      
              diminishing require an understanding of endocrinological and                   
              behavioral factors that lead to successful reproduction.                       
              Since 1983, Dr. Boersma has been studying such a species in                    
              Argentina and has identified some 5,000 individuals.  She has                  
              found that when two individuals establish a long-term pair bond,               
              their reproductive success is significantly greater.  Little is                
              understood about how this increased success is achieved.  With                 
              the help of her graduate student, Mr. Fowler, and Dr. Wingfield,               
              a world renown field endocrinologist, hormone changes will be                  
              determined across two full breeding seasons.  They will examine                
              the relationship between age, pair-status, hormone profile, and                
              how these factors interact to influence reproductive success.                  
              Utilizing these behavioral and endocrinological techniques will                
              help to understand the mechanisms whereby established pairs of a               
              long-lived species produce a higher number of offspring.  These                
              data will not only fill a significant gap in our knowledge of                  
              physiology but has the enormous potential of directly influencing              
              the management programs underlying conservation and restoration                
              of biological diversity.
