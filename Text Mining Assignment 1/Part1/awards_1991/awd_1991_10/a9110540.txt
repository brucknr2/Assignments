Abstract    :
              This research is a study of air-sea interaction processes in the               
              TOGA COARE region (western Pacific warm pool) using aircraft                   
              measurements taken during the Intensive Observing Period.  Air-sea             
              fluxes, their variability, parameterizations and coupling to the               
              ocean and atmosphere will be determined using turbulence-equipped              
              aircraft.  Several unique flight plans are proposed which use 2 or             
              3 of the aircraft in highly-coordinated flight patterns to measure             
              the surface variability of the fluxes, the vertical structure of               
              the boundary layer and the atmospheric sensible heat, moisture, and            
              momentum budgets.  The coupling to the ocean is emphasized with the            
              patterns centered over the TOGA COARE ships and buoys.  The                    
              atmospheric budgets will be determined when possible within the                
              scale of the larger array of radars and island sounding stations.              
              The aircraft sensible heat, moisture, and momentum boundary-layer              
              budgets will be compared to the larger scale budgets estimated from            
              the array of ships and radars to determine the statistical basis of            
              the larger scale budgets.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it is one of the TOGA COARE                 
              studies that examines the principal processes responsible for the              
              coupling of the ocean and the atmosphere in an especially climate              
              sensitive region of the world, the western Pacific warm pool                   
              system, the field site of TOGA COARE.
