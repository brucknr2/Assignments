Abstract    :
              This research project is aimed at developing                                   
              new methods and instrumentation for recording                                  
              and analyzing steady state visual evoked                                       
              potentials with the objective of assessing                                     
              visual function in infants and non-verbal                                      
              children.  The goal of each of the methods to                                  
              be employed is to increase the signal-to-                                      
              noise ratio of the processed responses.  A                                     
              new adaptive filtering procedure involving                                     
              the use of a highly selective notch filter                                     
              will be developed.  Multiple channel                                           
              recordings will be made using an of/off                                        
              stimulus paradigm.  Statistical methods to                                     
              combine response-related information across                                    
              multiple channels and multiple response                                        
              harmonics will be used so that small visual                                    
              evoked responses can be detected more                                          
              reliably.
