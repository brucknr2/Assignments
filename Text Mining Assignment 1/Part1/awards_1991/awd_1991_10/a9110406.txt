Abstract    :
              Dr. Nessler is working on the major latex protein of opium poppy               
              in transgenic tobacco plants in order to provide information as to             
              how hybrid proteins can be specifically targeted to cellular                   
              compartments.  The poppy laticifer cell type has the ability to                
              synthesize medicinally important alkaloids, therefore understanding            
              the protein targeting mechanism will help to elucidate the                     
              regulation of secondary products in plant metabolism.                          
                                                                                             
              Mr. Wooten plans to learn to engineer gene constructs and to                   
              transfer them to vectors.  He will, also develop techniques for                
              transforming plants with chimeric gene constructs and use                      
              immunocytochemical techniques to localize chimeric proteins in                 
              transgenic plants.
