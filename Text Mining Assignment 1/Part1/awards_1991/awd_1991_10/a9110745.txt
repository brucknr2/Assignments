Abstract    :
              This proposal will support both new and continuing investigations into         
              structural properties of complete sets, randomness in computation, and         
              internal structure such as a self-reducibility of feasible sets.  The          
              purposes are:  to continue successful work on the Berman-Hartmanis             
              isomorphism conjecture with particular emphasis on characterizing              
              complexity theoretic assumptions for the isomorphism conjecture to             
              hold or fail; to continue recent investigations into random oracles            
              that have yielded an interesting new proof technique and hold promise          
              of stronger results; and to examine the structural complexity                  
              consequences of checkability, coherence, random self-reducibility, and         
              other recently introduced concepts related to self-reducibility.//
