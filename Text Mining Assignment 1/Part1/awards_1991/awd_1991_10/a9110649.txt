Abstract    :
              There are large reliable differences in probability judgments                  
              made by individuals in Western countries like the United States                
              and those in numerous Asian countries. Most differences pertain                
              to calibration.  (Good calibration exists, for example, if about               
              40% of the events that are assigned probability judgements of 40%              
              actually happen.)  However, differences in discrimination have been            
              documented too.  (Discrimination is the ability of judgements to               
              sharply distinguish instances when a target event will occur from              
              those when it will not.)  Several potential explanations of the                
              observed differences are to be tested in experiments with subject              
              groups in the United States and a number of Asian locations.  One              
              hypothesis is that the effects are limited to judges' directly                 
              reported assessments, which are not their opinions.  Another claims            
              that the differences are restricted to a narrow class of events.               
              A third explanation says that they reflect societal differences in             
              the relative importance of various aspects of judgment quality.                
              The hypothesis of primary interest asserts that the effects rest               
              on cognitive processing habits rooted in different educational                 
              practices.  The proposed studies promise insights about universal              
              judgment mechanisms as well as mechanisms peculiar to given                    
              cultures.  They should provide guidance about problems in cross-               
              national communication and cooperation and the transferability of              
              decision technologies.
