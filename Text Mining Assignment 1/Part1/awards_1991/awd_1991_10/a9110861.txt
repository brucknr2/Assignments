Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to provide analysis tools and                
              techniques to support the evolutionary maturation of a software system         
              from an early prototype implementation used to explore requirements to         
              a robust, production implementation.  The approach taken is to first           
              develop automated analysis mechanisms for the generation of detailed           
              structural models for highly evolutionary or "exploratory" software            
              systems.  These mechanisms will then be applied to representative              
              software systems, and the resulting models will be analyzed both               
              individually and collectively for information that supports                    
              incremental improvements in structural robustness and reliability.             
              The tools and techniques will build upon prior experiences with type           
              flow analysis, a program analysis technique in support of exploratory          
              software development.  This research will yield new insight into the           
              phenomena of software evolution, new tools for automated support of            
              software development, and insights into the appropriate                        
              characteristics of languages for prototyping and production quality            
              implementations.
