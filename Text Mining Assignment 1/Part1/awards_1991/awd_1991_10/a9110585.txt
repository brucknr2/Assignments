Abstract    :
              The overall objective of the proposed research is to                           
              establish a quantitative framework for investigating the                       
              mechanisms governing nerve growth through tissue during                        
              development and regeneration. This framework will consist                      
              of: i) key parameters characterizing fundamental processes                     
              contributing to neurite outgrowth in a general                                 
              environment, and ii) a mathematical model of nerve growth                      
              based on these parameters.  A secondary objective is the                       
              development of an experimental model tissue for evaluation                     
              and manipulation of nerve growth.  The work in this                            
              proposal focuses on one component of that model tissue,                        
              the extracellular matrix molecule, collagen.
