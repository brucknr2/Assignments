Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research is to develop polymers which                    
              will selectively bind specific metal ions from aqueous                         
              solutions containing many ions, and may be reversibly                          
              regenerated without creating additional ionic wastes.  A                       
              potential application of these polymers would be removal of                    
              heavy metal ions from aqueous waste streams.  The use of                       
              macrocytic ligands for the design of such polymers is                          
              investigated.  Polymer-bound crown ethers, coronands, podands,                 
              and cryptands characterized.  A series of experimental studies                 
              are performed to establish the optimal polymer design.                         
              Polymer structural features are characterized using 13C NMR,                   
              while NMR relaxational studies provide information about the                   
              microenvironment of the polymer-bound ligand.  A novel                         
              synthetic technique for producing polymer-bound pseudocrown                    
              ethers in situ during free radical polymerizations is also                     
              investigated.  Theoretical analyses including Monte Carlo and                  
              molecular simulations are performed to provide insight into                    
              the underlying interactions among the macrocytic ligands, the                  
              polymer backbone, and the ions.
