Abstract    :
                   Water quality and fisheries resources are dependent on the                
              dynamics species interactions within fresh water lakes, yet                    
              little is known about how warmer temperatures (>25 C), in                      
              conjunction with food abundance, affect interactions of aquatic                
              species.  This research will explore interactive effects of                    
              elevated water temperature, up to 30 C, and food abundance on                  
              species interactions in a model planktonic food web.  This three               
              trophic-level food web includes a primary producer, 2 crustacean               
              grazers, and one predator, each can be easily cultured or                      
              maintained in the laboratory.  Effects of temperature, food                    
              abundance, and interactions of these conditions will be evaluated              
              using a series of single and two-species experiments performed on              
              members of the first two trophic level.  Populations growth rates              
              of the primary producer, loss rates caused by each grazer                      
              species, and the fecundity and survival of each grazer will be                 
              evaluated in different temperature/food abundance treatments.                  
              Results of experiments will be used to parameterize a simulation               
              model which will project the outcome of species interactions                   
              under a wide variety of environmental conditions,  Subsequent                  
              research will test these predictions, extend the model to include              
              3 trophic levels, and investigate how rapidly cladoceran grazers               
              evolve in response to thermal selection pressures.  Results will               
              1) aid in biotic assessments of elevated temperature, 2)                       
              establish a model food web for evaluating environmental effects                
              on species dynamics, and 3) allow evaluation of the relative                   
              magnitude of higher order interactions in communities that are                 
              environmentally stressed.
