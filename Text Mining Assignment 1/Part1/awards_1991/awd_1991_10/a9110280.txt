Abstract    :
              The primary objective of the proposed research is the development              
              of a thermo-mechanical framework for the analysis of large plastic             
              deformation and failure modes in layered metallic crystalline                  
              materials on the physical scale required in the fabrication of                 
              microelectronic and opto-electronic devices.  Cracks, voids, and               
              surface flaws have severely limited the synthesis and the                      
              processing of layered structures needed in the fabrication of                  
              electronic components.  The proposed thermo-viscoplastic                       
              theoretical and computational formulation will provide realistic               
              predictions of damage accumulation and material instabilities in               
              artificially structured materials.  In the proposed analysis, an               
              investigation of material failure modes that arise due to non-                 
              uniform large plastic deformation modes, the growth and the                    
              coalescence of voids, and the distribution of stresses, plastic                
              strains, and temperatures near the interfaces of the layered single            
              crystals will be undertaken.  Based on the thermo-mechanical                   
              characterization of failure, methodologies will be suggested for               
              the damage-free layering of metallic crystalline structures.  A                
              successful accomplishment of these proposed objectives would                   
              provide a more fundamental understanding of the inherent                       
              crystalline constraints on the layering of artificially structured             
              materials.
