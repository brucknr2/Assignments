Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is a research planning grant to study impact of massive             
              star formation on the disk and nuclear regions of spiral galaxies.             
              Both radio and optical observations will be utilized to study a                
              number of "hot-spot" galaxies.  Dr. Blaha has been very active in              
              producing good students who go on to do graduate work in astronomy,            
              and this grant will both advance out knowledge of the star                     
              formation process and offer opportunities for student participation            
              in this exciting research.
