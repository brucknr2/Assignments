Abstract    :
              This study will develop an improved model of the head-tape                     
              interactions in high-speed magnetic tape storage mechanisms.  In               
              particular, the coupled dynamics of the rapidly moving flexible                
              tape and the air foil bearing, which develops between the tape and             
              the recording head, will be modeled and a closed form solution will            
              be developed.  The model is expected to provide information about              
              pressure distribution, head-tape separation and other                          
              technologically important parameters.
