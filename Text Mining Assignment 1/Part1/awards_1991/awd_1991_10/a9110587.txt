Abstract    :
                   North-central Nevada contains one of the largest gold-                    
              producing districts in the world Sixty million ounces of gold                  
              (Knutsen and Wilson, 1990) have been identified in "Carlin-Type                
              "deposits in the Carlin trend, one of several mineralized trends               
              in the district.  The fundamental relationships between igneous                
              and tectonic activity in this region have yet to be fully                      
              understood.  An important consequence of crustal processes active              
              in this region is the massive concentration of gold.  By resolving             
              those processes responsible for gold concentration we can formulate            
              models describing ore genesis in Carlin-type deposits and improve              
              our understanding of geological processes active along this ancient            
              continental margin.  This research proposal outlines a detailed                
              fluid inclusion study to determine the pressure-temperature                    
              conditions during gold precipitation at the Getchell deposit, a                
              typical Carlin-Type system, and to document the physical and                   
              chemical nature of fluids that transported and precipitated gold               
              mineralization.
