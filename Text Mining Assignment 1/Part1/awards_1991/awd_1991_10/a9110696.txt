Abstract    :
              The research is on high-level system design, with a focus on                   
              partitioning logic among functional modules.  Three new problem                
              formulations and algorithms for performance driven layout are being            
              investigated.  These are: (1) numerical methods for finding sparse             
              cuts for logic bi-partitioning with extensions to multi-way logic              
              partitions; (2)  techniques for estimating rapidly optimal solution            
              values in large scale partition problems.  These methods are based             
              on random walks and the theory of simulated annealing, and have                
              extensions to module area estimation for floorplan synthesis; and              
              (3) a theoretical foundation (weighted module packing) for the                 
              performance-driven partitioning problem.  Provably good algorithms             
              for this problem are being examined.
