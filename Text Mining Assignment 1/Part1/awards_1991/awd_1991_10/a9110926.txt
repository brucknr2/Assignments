Abstract    :
              A key economic issue is whether poor countries or regions tend to              
              grow faster than rich ones: are there automatic forces that lead               
              to convergence over time in levels of per capita income and                    
              product?  The purpose of this project is to analyze this question              
              in three contexts.  First, personal income across the U.S. states              
              from 1840 to the present; second, gross domestic product for over              
              70 regions of 6 European countries from 1950 to 1985; and third,               
              national-account and other variables for about 100 counties from               
              1960 to 1985.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              A theoretical framework will be developed which is based on                    
              extensions of the neoclassical growth model.  From the perspective             
              of these extensions, recent theories sort into three categories:               
              replacing exogenous technological progress by theories of                      
              technological change; replacing exogenous population growth by                 
              theories of fertility; and replacing the usual assumption of                   
              diminishing returns of capital by the assumption of asymptotically             
              constant returns.  These growth theory models will then be tested              
              with data corresponding to the U.S., European, and international               
              contexts.  This research is important because it will provide a                
              better understanding of the factors determining economic growth and            
              development.
