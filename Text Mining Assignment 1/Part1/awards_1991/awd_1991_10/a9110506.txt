Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              At present, it is unknown whether the neural circuitry which                   
              underlies learning in mature animals is the same as that which                 
              underlies learning in immature animals.  However, it is clear                  
              that associative learning is possible in newborn rats prior to                 
              development or maturation of many structures and neurochemical                 
              systems known to be important for learning in the adult.  Dr.                  
              Regina Sullivan intends to expand our knowledge in this important              
              research area by assessing whether a specific neurotransmitter                 
              system, the norepinephrine system, may account for at least some               
              of these differences in learning which occur during development.               
              She will employ pharmacological, neurophysiological, and                       
              anatomical techniques to research this topic.  This work is                    
              important as we attempt to understand the developmental aspects                
              of learning.
