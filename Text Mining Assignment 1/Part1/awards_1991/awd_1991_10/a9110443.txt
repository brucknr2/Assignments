Abstract    :
                   There are many large simulations in science and engineering which         
              are very time-consuming when performed on sequential machines.                 
              Parallel simulation is the most promising approach for speeding up             
              these simulations.  Two major strategies have emerged as viable                
              candidates for parallel discrete-event simulations:  the conservative          
              strategy, pioneered by Chandy and Misra, and the optimistic strategy,          
              pioneered by Jefferson.  In the past several years, there has been a           
              great deal of research in comparing the two strategies, using both             
              empirical and formal methods.  But several interesting issues remain.          
                   This project addresses some of these issues in formal models for          
              parallel and distributed discrete-event simulation algorithms.  Of             
              specific interest is to include some of the costs which are ignored or         
              vastly simplified in many existing formal models, such as rollback,            
              message-passing, state-saving, and deadlock detection and recovery             
              costs.  In general, including these overhead costs in analytical               
              models causes the resulting analysis to be intractable.  By                    
              restricting the application domain, these costs can be included in             
              formal models, resulting in models which more accurately reflect               
              actual behavior.  In particular, it is planned to compare different            
              simulation strategies, so inclusion of the overhead costs could affect         
              the resulting analysis.
