Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The proposed research is aimed at the development of novel algorithms          
              for the solution of shape optimization problems in fluid dynamics.             
              Despite the availability of several analysis techniques for flow               
              problems, design techniques that are much needed from an engineering           
              perspective are scarce.  In a design approach, the goal is to find             
              the shape that gives the best performance.  The proposed work will             
              address the inverse problem of how to determine the system geometry            
              for optimum flow performance when the system behavior is described by          
              the steady Navier-Stokes (NS) equations.  This problem will be                 
              approached using ideas of constrained optimal control.  The NS                 
              equations and an additional set of adjoint partial differential                
              equations needs to be solved.  In the proposed research, a                     
              computational code for the solution of the adjoint equations will be           
              written and an optimization algorithm will be developed.  Numerical            
              results will be obtained using this algorithm for several sample               
              problems to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.  The                  
              analysis and the numerical implementation will also be extended to             
              compressible laminar flow.  Computational implementation will be               
              performed on the Cray YMP of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.//
