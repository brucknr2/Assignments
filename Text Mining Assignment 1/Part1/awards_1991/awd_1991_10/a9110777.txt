Abstract    :
              This is an award to support preliminary research on the                        
              extent to which the pheriphytic biolayer of stream                             
              sediments mediates the transfer and transformation of                          
              polychlorinated biphenyls and to determine rates of their                      
              transformation and/or bioaccumulation and/or                                   
              transformation.  The research to be conducted will involve                     
              use of laboratory-scale artificial streams to assess                           
              interstream variability, to refine the technical protocols                     
              for determination of polychlorinated biphenyls in the                          
              sediment and periphytic layers, and to obtain preliminary                      
              data on the function of these layers in the transfer                           
              process.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this award was submitted in                            
              response to the Program Announcement NSF 90-121, Research                      
              Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards for Women                        
              Scientists and Engineers.  Results of this planning phase                      
              are expected to be utilized in developing a full research                      
              proposal for consideration of further support by the                           
              National Science Foundation.
