Abstract    :
                   This effort is to support various activities related to the               
              National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Integrated                    
              Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) in order to promote                
              data compatibility between agencies and improve the quality of                 
              data.  The NCES, IPEDS data will provide the National Science                  
              Foundation (NSF), an essential portion of the statistics needed to             
              give a comprehensive base of knowledge on undergraduate education.             
              IPEDS is a system by which data are collected from all institutions            
              and educational organizations whose primary purpose is to provide              
              postsecondary education.  IPEDS collects much of the information               
              that is needed from baccalaureate or higher institutions, and it is            
              the only source of comprehensive data from two-year award                      
              institutions.  This current proposal will allow the Foundation to              
              acquire at an early date, edited detailed data for each                        
              postsecondary institution.
