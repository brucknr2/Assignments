Abstract    :
              This project is to support a two and one-half day conference                   
              aimed at establishing a national platform for stimulating the                  
              life sciences community to play a more active and sustained role               
              in science education.  Specific goals to be addressed by the                   
              conference are to remedy increasing shortages of qualified life                
              scientists, to increase scientific literacy in the general                     
              population, and to enhance the commitment of private as well as                
              public funding resources to life science education.  The report                
              resulting from the conference is expected to help set a national               
              agenda based on the participation of previously unrelated                      
              professional societies.
