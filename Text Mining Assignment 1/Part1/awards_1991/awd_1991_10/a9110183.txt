Abstract    :
                   This project in computer networking concerns traffic                      
              integration in the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) layer,                     
              particularly problems relating to bandwidth allocation and                     
              traffic control.  The investigator has proposed an ATM traffic                 
              control framework, a central portion of which is the traffic                   
              control module (TCM).  The effort involves: i) analytical and                  
              experimental work on traffic characterization, ii) TCM parameter               
              evaluation and engineering, iii) performance analysis of the TCM               
              serving statistically multiplexed call sequences and class                     
              definition, iv) scheduling multiple traffic classes, v)                        
              deterministic description of an incoming call sequence in terms                
              of the parameters of the TCM, vi) creation of a UNIX-based                     
              prototyping environment on which the evolving traffic control                  
              framework can be tested, experimented with, and demonstrated.
