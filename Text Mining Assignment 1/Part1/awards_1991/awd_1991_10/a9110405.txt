Abstract    :
              The IUTAM symposium on The Mechanics of Fluidized Beds will be                 
              organized by Drs. G. M. Homsy and G. K. Batchelor at Stanford                  
              University in July 1-5, 1991.  The topics of the meeting will                  
              be the mechanics of suspensions, fluidized beds, granular                      
              media, and fluid-particle systems in general.  The purpose is                  
              to provide an opportunity for engineers, applied                               
              mathematician, and applied scientists to meet and discuss the                  
              advances in understanding two-phase fluid-particle systems, as                 
              well as to identify unsolved problems and future trends.                       
              About 50 participants are expected to attend.  There will be                   
              six invited lectures.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The proposed symposium will provide a forum to evaluate the                    
              present research on fluidizing fluid-particle systems and                      
              discuss future trends.  The meeting will bring together                        
              several of the best researches in the field from USA, Canada                   
              and Europe.
