Abstract    :
              An one-day workshop on "Atomization and Sprays" is proposed to                 
              be organized on July 19, 1991, with leading scientists in the                  
              field from U.S., Europe and Japan.  Fundamental aspects and                    
              potential industrial applications will be discussed in a                       
              variety of topics, including nozzle engineering, spray                         
              structure, computational fluid and particle mechanics, laser                   
              diagnostics techniques, paint spraying, manufacturing with                     
              liquid metal sprays and agricultural spraying.  About twelve                   
              experts will present summaries of the state of the art and                     
              identify unsolved problems and future research trends.  These                  
              presentations will be reviewed by all participants, and a                      
              report will be written.  The meeting will be held at NIST, and                 
              will be chaired by Dr. N. Chigier.  About 50 participants are                  
              expected to attend.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Recent advances in understanding the spray physics have open                   
              new opportunities for research and industrial applications.                    
              The proposed symposium will bring together several of the best                 
              researchers in the field from US and abroad, and it is                         
              expected to provide  a set of recommendations for future                       
              research.
