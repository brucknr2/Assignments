Abstract    :
              There are many materials which                                                 
              posses a certain degree of                                                     
              intelligence allowing them to                                                  
              adjust their behavior on the basis                                             
              of their history.  This property is                                            
              sometimes referred to as                                                       
              hysteresis.  Design of devices and                                             
              systems is often complicated by the                                            
              presence of hysteresis because no                                              
              adequate analytical or computer                                                
              tools are available to predict                                                 
              various physical parameters and                                                
              properties in this case.  It is the                                            
              objective of this project to                                                   
              develop computational methods for                                              
              modeling of electromagnetic systems                                            
              with hysteresis.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The research will focus on the                                                 
              following two problems.  One is the                                            
              development and selection of

              which can accurately represent                                                 
              constitutive laws.  The other is

              and constitutive laws.

              electromagnetic field problems with                                            
              hysteresis have been addressed

              goal here to improve the existing                                              
              methods of field computation in

              model will be used.  Finite element                                            
              techniques are also suggested for
