Abstract    :
              The proposed work will develop a three-dimensional model of the                
              scoliotic spine.  The curvature and length will be determined                  
              from radiographs, and the material properties will be initially                
              obtained from published literature.  The model will then be used               
              to predict the correction expected by a given surgical procedure               
              employing a certain number of fixation sites (where the spine is               
              attached to a rigid rod to correct the scoliosis).  The                        
              simulation results will then be compared with data obtained from               
              post operative radiographs.  The project will lead to the                      
              development of a theoretically oriented biomedical engineer with               
              excellent ties to the clinical world; and if successful, it may                
              also result in the reduction of the number of fixation sites used              
              for the operative procedure.
