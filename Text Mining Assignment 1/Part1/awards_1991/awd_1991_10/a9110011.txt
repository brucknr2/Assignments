Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is generally believed that by the year 2000, less than a decade             
              away, the United States will face a serious shortfall of engineers             
              and scientists.  Many believe that the problem lies not only in the            
              demographics which project decreasing numbers of 18 to 22 year-olds            
              entering the nation's colleges, but also a serious problem in the              
              way in which engineering, mathematics and science are taught in our            
              schools.  National reports have been written, conferences held, and            
              some very successful models of educational reform and innovation               
              have been implemented at individual institutions.                              
                                                                                             
              The University of Maryland, College Park is sponsoring a workshop              
              to bring together national leaders who have been at the forefront              
              of these activities to develop an action model to transfer, where              
              appropriate, some of these innovations in mathematics and                      
              engineering education.  The workshop will be held at the Center of             
              Adult Education at the University of Maryland, College Park,                   
              Maryland on April 11-12, 1991.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The objectives of the workshop are:                                            
                                                                                             
                   o to bring together a small but select group of national                  
              leaders in mathematics and engineering education reform;                       
                                                                                             
                   o to provide a forum for the exchange of the best of the                  
              national projects in mathematics and engineering education; and                
                                                                                             
                   o to develop an action agenda for national implementation of              
              the best of these projects in mathematics and engineering                      
              education.
