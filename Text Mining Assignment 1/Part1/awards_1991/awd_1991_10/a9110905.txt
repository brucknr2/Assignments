Abstract    :
              The proposal involves estimating the memory requirements of a program          
              by a pre-processor at compile time.  The information obtained about            
              the memory requirements is used for designing better memory management         
              schemes in conventional uniprocessor virtual memory systems, CVM, for          
              efficient page distribution in a distributed virtual memory system,            
              DVM, and for load characterization necessary for load balancing                
              operations.                                                                    
              The pre-processor analyzes the source code to identify the locality            
              constructs exhibited by the program.  Then it estimates the virtual            
              sizes of the localities and the position or the level of a locality            
              construct within a structure of nested localities.                             
              For CVM, the size and the level of a locality are passed to the                
              operating system through memory directives.  At execution time, the            
              operating system allocates memory to the running process guided by             
              memory directives.  For DVM, the directives are used to distribute the         
              pages of a program over distinct sets and to distribute the sets of            
              pages over various nodes in the system.  A quantitative                        
              characterization  of the load through estimation of the memory                 
              requirements of a program will provide a solution to the                       
              synchronization problem encountered in load balancing.  As a side              
              effect, this will give more precise definition of balanced system.
