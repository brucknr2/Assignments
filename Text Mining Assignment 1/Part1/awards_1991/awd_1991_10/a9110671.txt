Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Carnegie-Rochester Conference on Public Policy is designed to              
              foster research and discussion of major policy issues by economists            
              from academia and policy making institutions.  Economists in                   
              universities are often unfamiliar with the constraining effect of              
              institutional arrangements in the shaping of policy issues and                 
              policies and economists in government are often less aware of                  
              current research and its implications.  A central purpose of the               
              conference is to provide the interaction between these groups in               
              order to improve the economic analysis of policy issues and policy.            
                                                                                             
              The specific aims of the conference are to: 1) develop the                     
              implications of recent research for policy; 2) bring together                  
              economists with different approaches or conclusions to narrow the              
              differences; and 3) to uncover the analysis used by institutions               
              that set policies.  The conferences are held semi-annually at the              
              University of Rochester and Carnegie Mellon University.  About 40              
              participants plus faculty and graduate students from the host                  
              institutions are invited to each conference.  Participants from                
              U.S. and foreign central banks and U.S. and international agencies             
              attend regularly.  Special care is taken to involve promising                  
              younger scholars.  The paper and formal discussions are edited and             
              prepared for publication to broaden the impact of the conference.
