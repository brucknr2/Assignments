Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this study is to further ascertain the                        
              feasibility of reinforcing cohesionless soil by adding small,                  
              discontinuous reinforcing elements to the soil matrix.  The                    
              findings from Phase I study were that cohesionless soils can be                
              appreciably strengthened and stiffened by the addition of such                 
              elements by both random mixing as well as by placement in                      
              discrete layers.   The research will include the use of                        
              manufactured elements in potential commercial applications                     
              including retaining wall design and construction, pavement system              
              design and construction, buried pipe/conduit design and                        
              construction, and marginal land improvement/vehicular                          
              trafficability enhancement.
