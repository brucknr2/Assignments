Abstract    :
              This is a request for block international travel funds for                     
              the 30th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control                               
              (CDC) to be held in Brighton, England from December                            
              11-13, 1991.  The CDC is one of the world's largest and                        
              most important conferences on control theory and                               
              applications.  The Brighton location will be only the                          
              second time the CDC has been held outside the United                           
              States.  The funds will be instrumental in improving the                       
              technical success of the conference by enabling                                
              participation of sufficient numbers of key U.S. authors.
