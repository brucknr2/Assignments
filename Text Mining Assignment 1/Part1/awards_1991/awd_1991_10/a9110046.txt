Abstract    :
              In this project, PI's from three institutions will carry out                   
              sampling on a transect in the Southern Ocean along 65 degrees                  
              South latitude across the Ross Sea.  The sampling will be carried              
              out on the USSR vessel, R/V IOFFE.  Scientists from the Scripps                
              Institution of Oceanography will be responsible for the                        
              hydrography and nutrients, while scientists from Lamont will                   
              acquire and analyze samples for the tracers, Tritium, Helium,                  
              Oxygen-18, and Carbon-14.  Oregon State University (this project)              
              will provide overall coordination and contribute to the overall                
              data analysis and integration.  This section constitutes a joint               
              contribution by the USA and the Soviet Union to the International              
              World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), specifically,                       
              Hydrographic line S-4.
