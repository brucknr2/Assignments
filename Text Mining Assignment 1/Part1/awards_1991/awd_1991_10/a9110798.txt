Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  Most diffusion models have assumed an unstructured pattern to             
              the spread of information, disease, or elements in other                       
              substantive contexts.  The population dynamics of disease spread               
              only by close personal contact is an important example of a                    
              diffusion process for which the assumption that diffusion is                   
              unstructured, that the population mixes randomly, is inappropriate.            
              While biological factors regulate the transmission and natural                 
              history of the infectious agent, social factors, which have been               
              typically neglected in the field of epidemiological modeling,                  
              regulate the pattern of differential association, or social mixing,            
              and thus the structure within which transmission is channelled.                
              This research planning project seeks to develop a plan for                     
              producing a general modeling framework that will enable analysis               
              of selective mixing in diffusion processes.  Steps leading to this             
              research include the development of a solid collaborative working              
              agenda with potential colleagues overseas, a period of intensive               
              collaboration in order to broaden the sociological focus of the                
              work, and analysis of extant data from several sources on patterns             
              of selective mixing and on patterns of diffusion in disease and                
              other empirical contexts.                                                      
                                                                                             
                   This project will enhance capability for modeling diffusion               
              processes by developing a plan to examine how the structure of                 
              social networks affects the nature and velocity of diffusion.  It              
              will also facilitate significant collaboration between the fields              
              of sociology and biology.
