Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will compute efficiency bounds for a large class of               
              semiparametric discrete choice models.  (These models relax some               
              of the distributional assumptions, which are not supported by                  
              economic theory, that occur in traditional models of discrete                  
              choice.)  Efficiency bounds provide benchmarks for evaluating the              
              performance of alternative statistical estimation strategies by                
              providing lower bounds on the variability of any estimate.                     
                                                                                             
              It is expected that the project will show that a large class of                
              existing estimators are not efficient relative to the benchmark                
              bounds on estimator variance.  The project will identify strategies            
              for improving upon the existing estimators through exploitation of             
              qualitative shape restrictions on the choice probabilities --                  
              restrictions that are ignored by most existing methodologies.  This            
              project will provide important guidance for future improvements in             
              the econometric methods available for analysis of discrete                     
              behavior.
