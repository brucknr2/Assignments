Abstract    :
              This research is aimed at obtaining a better understanding of how to           
              design expert systems for real-time applications.  A metric for a              
              real-time expert system is defined as the probability that the system          
              successfully formulates and executes strategies under real-time                
              constraints.  The objectives of the proposed research are to propose a         
              formal theory for quantifying the estimation of this metric and to             
              investigate the validity of the theory by applying it to develop a             
              real-time expert system embedded within a control system with varying          
              degrees of timing requirements.  It is expected that the proposed              
              theory can serve as a basis for designing and verifying the                    
              functional and timing requirements of future real-time expert systems.
