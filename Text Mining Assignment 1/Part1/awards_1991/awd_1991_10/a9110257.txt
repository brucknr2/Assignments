Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation grant will                                            
              determine the response of                                                      
              biological tissue to high power                                                
              laser light.  Special emphasis will                                            
              be placed on characterizing the                                                
              reversible and irreversible changes                                            
              that occur as a result of the                                                  
              heating caused by the laser.  The                                              
              investigation will include a                                                   
              modification of existing                                                       
              mathematical models to take into                                               
              account the observed effects.  This                                            
              basic work will provide important                                              
              new information for the improved                                               
              design of lasers for biomedical                                                
              applications.
