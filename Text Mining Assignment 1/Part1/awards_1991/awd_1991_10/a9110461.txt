Abstract    :
              This study is to examine the                                                   
              abnormal adhesive interactions                                                 
              between sickle blood cells and the                                             
              endothelial cells of arterial wall                                             
              under physiological flow                                                       
              conditions.  A well characterized                                              
              model system using a flow chamber                                              
              will be utilized to study this                                                 
              interaction under well quantitated                                             
              conditions.  The study will be                                                 
              aided by the use of digital                                                    
              processing of video-taped images                                               
              showing the interactions between                                               
              the red blood cells and endothelial                                            
              cells deposited on glass slides.                                               
              Utilizing engineering technology in                                            
              a novel way, this study will                                                   
              contribute to our understanding of                                             
              the pathophysiology of sickle cell                                             
              disease.  The grant will also allow                                            
              the professional development of an                                             
              exemplary role model for
