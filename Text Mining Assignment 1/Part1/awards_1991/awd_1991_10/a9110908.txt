Abstract    :
              Much research focuses on the development of specialized architectures.         
              To increase the utility of task-oriented or specialized parallel               
              networks, one can simulate one parallel network on another.  Of                
              primary interest are lower bounds on the cost of such simulation.              
              This project investigates the actual performance of proposed                   
              theoretical embeddings strategies by simulating them on a hypercube            
              machine.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The contribution of this practical investigation will be to establish          
              how quickly the increase in embedding costs prohibit an actual                 
              simulation.  By simulating different architectures on the hypercube,           
              one may compare how similar measures of embedding costs, and their             
              growth, are affected by architectural design.  For example, an edge            
              congestion cost greater than one may be more deleterious for an                
              asymmetric network.  Furthermore, the effects of even a slight                 
              increase in such a cost may have more dramatic effects in asymmetric           
              architectures.  However, such differences may be minimized if the cost         
              can be localized or redistributed.  Pure embeddings do not consider            
              these possible revisions but a simulation may suggest an efficient             
              means for obtaining improvements.
