Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will develop and implement a                                       
              computational nonlinear mode superposition                                     
              algorithm in a parallel computing                                              
              environment, based on Duffing's principle of                                   
              instantaneous mode superposition.  This                                        
              algorithm will be applied to cable-stayed                                      
              bridges, which exhibits geometric                                              
              nonlinearities due to cable sag, axial-                                        
              flexural interaction, and inherently large                                     
              displacements.  These nonlinearities are most                                  
              pronounced in the partially-constructed                                        
              stage.  The resulting applications will be                                     
              used to understand the complex interactions                                    
              of earthquakes, extreme winds and traffic                                      
              forces and their induced structural dynamic                                    
              response.  The research will provide the                                       
              practicing and research engineers with a tool                                  
              that will help in better understanding                                         
              nonlinear dynamic response behavior of large                                   
              structures such as cable-stayed bridges.
