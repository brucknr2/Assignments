Abstract    :
              The objectives are to characterize devices                                     
              employing a single-electron charging effect known                              
              as the Coulomb blockade effect and to investigate                              
              the potential for applying this effect to the                                  
              development of novel devices.  The first phase of                              
              the proposed study will develop devices on                                     
              semiconductor heterostructures employing two basic                             
              configurations and will characterize the conductance                           
              modulation and current-voltage characteristics                                 
              associated with Coulomb blockade effects in the                                
              device.  The experimental results will be compared                             
              with predicted trends in order to validate the                                 
              predictions and to evaluate the feasibility of                                 
              proposals for more advanced structures.  The                                   
              second phase of the study will investigate advanced                            
              devices based on this effect.  Devices based on                                
              several proposed configurations will be developed                              
              and evaluated.  Proposed transistors of this type are                          
              expected to offer better gain and speed                                        
              characteristics than conventional devices and are                              
              expected to operate at more reasonable                                         
              temperatures and voltage levels than those required                            
              for mesoscopic structures.
