Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is a Research Planning Grant.  The goal of the work is              
              to test, develop, and select suitable computational methods capable            
              of describing accurately the collision induced absorption spectra              
              of pairs of anisotropic molecules.  Two molecular systems, N2-CH4              
              and CO2-CO2, will be selected for their significance in planetary              
              sciences and because of the availability of reliable laboratory                
              measurements.  The physical processes responsible for the observed             
              spectra of these molecules must be identified first.  Next                     
              computational methods will be tested.  Reliable, yet efficient and             
              economical methods of computing the collision induced absorption               
              spectra must be selected.  Once this objective is reached such                 
              spectra may be modeled with the accuracy required by the                       
              astrophysical applications.  Dr. Borysow plans to develop an on-               
              going cooperation and an active participation in the utilization               
              of her computational results in research in planetary sciences.
