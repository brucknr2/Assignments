Abstract    :
              This project explores the preservation of the Hamiltonian structure of         
              Vlasov-Maxwell equations in a numerical method.  The fundamental               
              aspects of applying spectral type methods to infinite dimensional              
              Hamiltonian systems so that the resulting semi-discrete (continuous in         
              time) system exactly preserves the system Hamiltonian and some other           
              conservation laws are being investigated.  A functional approximation          
              operator is defined to map the true infinite dimensional phase space           
              to a finite dimensional numerical approximation, and an imbedding              
              operator is defined to map this numerical phase space back to the              
              exact phase space.  Together these operators allow the Poisson bracket         
              on the infinite dimensional phase space to be transferred to the               
              numerical phase space; Hamiltonian dynamics can then be defined on the         
              numerical phase space using a numerical approximation to the exact             
              Hamiltonian.  The resulting finite dimensional Hamiltonian system              
              represents a semi-discrete numerical method that exactly conserves the         
              system energy.  Conditions necessary for the numerical conservation of         
              Casimirs and momenta are also being derived.  These techniques are             
              also being extended to Hamiltonian systems which are not isolated and          
              allow general boundary conditions.  The application of these                   
              techniques to the Vlasov-Maxwell equations will allow numerical plasma         
              kinetic theory models which exactly conserve energy, particles and             
              momentum, even at a finite expansion in space, velocity and time.
