Abstract    :
              Trust is important for all forms of human social interaction and               
              lack of trust appears to be a critical factor in creating the                  
              divisive controversies that surround the management of risks from              
              modern technologies.  Over the past 25 years, our society has                  
              witnessed a steady erosion of trust in the technical, legal,                   
              governmental and institutional systems that are called upon                    
              to manage risks.  This proposal describes research designed to                 
              understand the nature of trust, its role in risk management, and               
              the individual, technical, and organizational behaviors that                   
              are needed to build and maintain it.  Specific studies are planned             
              to determine the multiple facets or characteristics of trust,                  
              analogous to the characteristics that have been found to underlie              
              perceived risk.  Additional studies are designed to illuminate the             
              events and processes that create and destroy trust in risk                     
              management.
