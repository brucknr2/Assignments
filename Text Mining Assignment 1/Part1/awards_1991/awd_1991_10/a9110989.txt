Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on contaminant                            
              interactions with clays used in containment of structures                      
              for storing hazardous wastes.  The objectives of this                          
              research include quantification of the structural changes                      
              in clays when they are permeated by organic fluids,                            
              determination of the distribution pattern of contaminants                      
              in these clays, and examination of the feasibility of                          
              removing volatile organic compounds from these clays by a                      
              vapor extraction process.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This proposal was submitted in response to Program                             
              Announcement NSF 88-99, Research Initiation Awards.                            
              Results are expected to improve the engineering design of                      
              containment ponds, landfills, waste covers and slurry                          
              walls associated with storage of hazardous solids and                          
              liquids.  Results may also be applied in a process for                         
              decontamination of contaminated soils by vapor extraction                      
              alone or in combination with another physical process,                         
              and/or chemical and biologically-based remediation                             
              systems.
