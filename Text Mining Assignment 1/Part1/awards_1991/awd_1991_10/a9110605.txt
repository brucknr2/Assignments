Abstract    :
              This is an investigation of issues in debugging distributed programs           
              with large numbers of processes.  Existing distributed debugging               
              systems are simple extensions of sequential debugging systems and are          
              inadequate for supporting message-based distributed programs.                  
              Distributed programs are inherently different from sequential programs         
              due to the presence of nondeterminism, concurrency and communication           
              delays.                                                                        
                   The research in distributed debugging supports both state-based           
              and event-based approaches for debugging.   The state-based is                 
              supported mainly by use of breakpoint predicates detection.  A logic           
              for specification of breakpoint predicates characterizes the most              
              useful properties of global traces in a distributed environment.  The          
              logic is suitably defined to permit efficient detection of global              
              predicates with out resort to computation of global snapshots.                 
              Algorithms have been developed to detect global predicates expressed           
              as simple conjunction, disjunction or sequence of local predicates.            
              These mechanisms can detect a large subset of predicates defined by            
              the logic, even if the predicates are unstable.  The main objective is         
              to extend these algorithms for applicability to more general global            
              predicates.
