Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A central question in development of the brain is how                          
              precise sets of functional connections are made between                        
              particular groups of nerve cells.  Model systems to study this                 
              question often involve a well-defined sensory organ and the                    
              target areas in the cortex of the brain which receive those                    
              signals.  Correct central connectivity has been suggested to                   
              depend on having normal sensory experience during development;                 
              with deprivation, there often are physiological and biochemical                
              changes in the target neurons in sensory cortex.                               
                                                                                             
              This study uses the tactile whiskers of rodents and their                      
              characteristic "barrel fields" of target nerve cells in the                    
              cortex as a model with the addition of clear anatomical                        
              organization.  The whiskers are easily trimmed at different times              
              to provide a painless and easily reversible form of sensory                    
              deprivation in a local area.  Physiological, biochemical and                   
              anatomical techniques will be used to find out how deprivation-                
              induced changes in activity of a particular neurotransmitter                   
              molecule (GABA) may provide a mechanism for changing the relative              
              levels of inhibition versus excitation during development and                  
              establishment of normal connections.  Results from this novel                  
              model system will have an important impact on sensory                          
              neuroscience as well as developmental neuroscience.
