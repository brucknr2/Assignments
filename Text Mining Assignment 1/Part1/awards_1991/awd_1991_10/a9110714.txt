Abstract    :
                   Advances in ceramic materials hinge in a critical fashion on              
              the initial powder characteristics.  Specifically, the                         
              requirements are:  small particle size (nanometer range), narrow               
              size distribution and high purity.  For practical/economical                   
              reasons a continuous, as opposed to batch, generation process, is              
              preferable.  To fulfill the required powder characteristics                    
              maximum control over the fundamental physical and chemical                     
              processes during particle formation is needed.  The work                       
              addresses all these requirements, and offers a system for                      
              continuous and controlled generation of fine multi-component                   
              ceramic powders.  The generation of the particles is done in the               
              vapor phase from gaseous and liquid reactants.  The reactor is a               
              multi-stream inverted H2/O2/invert diffusion flame.  Electric                  
              fields are used to control particle size via control of                        
              coagulation and residence time.                                                
                   The powder characteristics will be measured in-situ with                  
              optical (non-intrusive) techniques.  The work will include:                    
              demonstration of principle; mapping the domain of the controlling              
              parameters; comparing results with theoretical models and their                
              modification; and examination of closed loop process control                   
              strategies based on the in-situ powder measurements.
