Abstract    :
              Real-time computer systems perform computations and I/O operations in          
              a time frame defined by processes in the external environment.  This           
              research addresses the class of real-time systems characterized by the         
              existence of strict timing constraints that must be satisfied if the           
              system is to function correctly.  The goal is to develop methods for           
              assessing and ensuring the temporal correctness of such real-time              
              systems.                                                                       
                   There are two main thrusts to this research.  The first is the            
              creation and analysis of more pragmatic models of real-time systems.           
              The goal is to extend the theory of deterministic scheduling and               
              resource allocation to encompass more realistic assumptions about              
              program behaviors and to accommodate new forms of timing constraints           
              motivated by the development of technologies such as digital video and         
              high speed local area networks.  The second focus is on the design and         
              construction of operating system kernels that efficiently support the          
              process model and scheduling policies indicated by the analysis of the         
              resource allocation problems.  The goal is to provide a facility for           
              the predictable execution of real-time applications.
