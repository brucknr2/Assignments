Abstract    :
              The power of three message context modification techniques:                    
              priming, planning and participation, to enhance the effectiveness              
              of risk communication, will be tested.  Priming is the provision               
              of message-relevant information prior to receipt of the target                 
              message.  Planning refers to cognitive and behavioral activities               
              engaged in by the audience, whether singly or in groups.  The                  
              purpose of planning is improved hazard management.  Participation              
              refers to interaction among persons acting as a problem-solving                
              team.  The objectives of the project are to:                                   
              (1) assess the efficacy of the Involvement/Relevance/Ability                   
              context modification approach to risk communication improvement                
              within an interactive process,                                                 
              (2) to assess the relative efficacy of the two approaches to risk              
              communication improvement both when attempting to reduce public                
              concern about a risk and when attempting to increase public concern            
              about a risk.                                                                  
              Results from this study will contribute to the development of risk             
              communication theory and improved risk communication practice.
