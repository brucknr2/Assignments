Abstract    :
                   Software quality assessment, although acknowledged to be of the           
              first importance, is today an art rather than a science.  Program              
              testing is the best defined and least subjective component of quality          
              assurance, but even its methods are poorly related to measurable               
              quality.  Program testing has two purposes:  (1) to expose software            
              failures for repair, and (2) to establish confidence that future               
              failures are unlikely.  The foundational theory must be probabilistic,         
              because any test is no more than a sample of program behavior.  For            
              any program P and test method M, (1) What is the probability that M            
              will uncover a failure in P? (2) After M has been used without                 
              failure, what is the probability that in fact P cannot fail?  The              
              purpose of this project is to improve on previous theoretical answers          
              to these questions.  Prior theoretical work can be characterized first         
              as being imprecise, in that characteristics of M and P do not enter            
              the theory in a useful way; and second, as being overly pessimistic,           
              in that under the best of circumstances the probabilities are very             
              low.  New theoretical work will be guided by experiments on existing           
              and new test methods, using novel support tools.
