Abstract    :
                   This grant is a Career Advancement Award for Women                        
              Scientists and Engineers made to a faculty member at Texas A.                  
              and M. University.  Prof. Dutta will work with Prof. Gene D.                   
              Sprouse at State University of New York at Stony Brook on the                  
              development of a technique to detect nuclear polarization                      
              caused by optical pumping of heavy radioactive atoms.  The                     
              method will have applicability to the measurement of nuclear                   
              spins, moments, and deformation for nuclear isomers and nuclei                 
              far from the region of stability.
