Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on a concept for                          
              removing organic contaminants from soil using                                  
              microorganisms with natural ability to attack the organic                      
              compounds adsorbed on soil particles and to determine                          
              whether biological degradation could be enhanced by                            
              presence of surfactants.  The investigator plans on                            
              establishing a defined model system consisting of a                            
              naphthalene saturated soil and an organism known to                            
              efficiently degrade this compound.  He then plans to                           
              evaluate the effects of synthetic surfactants on their                         
              ability to degrade this compound and to determine whether                      
              bacteria known to produce surfactants could be utilized in                     
              place of the synthetic surfactants to accomplish the same                      
              end result more efficiently and effectively.                                   
                                                                                             
              This proposal was submitted in response to Program                             
              Announcement NSF 88-99, Research Initiation Awards.                            
              Results are expected to improve the engineering design of                      
              biologically-based remediation, potentially coupled to                         
              chemical and/or physical systems for removing contaminants                     
              from soil that are likely contaminants of groundwater.
