Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Over the past twenty years at least seventy different chemical                 
              compounds have been detected from interstellar gas.  The                       
              overwhelming majority of these molecules have been identified on               
              the basis of their rotational spectra, which for the most part were            
              measured in the laboratory prior to their observation with radio               
              telescopes.  Successful observation and identification of                      
              interstellar molecules have therefore been accomplished through the            
              symbiotic relationship of radio astronomy and high resolution                  
              molecular spectroscopy in the laboratory.                                      
                                                                                             
              Dr. Ziurys will use this award to initiate a new research program              
              which will combine her observational work with a supporting                    
              laboratory effort.  The laboratory work will enable her to measure             
              the rotational spectra, and hence rest frequencies, of potential               
              new interstellar molecules.  The species to be studied are those               
              likely to be associated with high temperatures in interstellar                 
              clouds.  These include molecules of silicon, magnesium, iron,                  
              aluminum, and calcium.  This award is made under the Research                  
              Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award program at the                
              NSF.
