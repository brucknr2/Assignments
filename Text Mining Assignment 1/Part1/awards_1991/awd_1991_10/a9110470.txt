Abstract    :
              A numerical and theoretical study of the motion of deformable                  
              drops in flow through circular tubes is proposed.  This                        
              investigation incorporates the effects of finite inertia and                   
              surfactant impurities. A modified version of the continuum                     
              surface force (CFS) model is developed which accounts for the                  
              transport of insoluble surfactant in the deformed surface of                   
              the drop.  The modified CSF model is used to obtain numerical                  
              solutions for the drop deformation and speed, as well as the                   
              additional pressure loss in the tube due to the presence of                    
              the drop.  The drop shape and its velocity relative to the                     
              average velocity of the two-phase system are measured                          
              in vertical glass tubes wherein the motion of the drop through                 
              the tube is visualized, and then compared to numerical                         
              solutions.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The results of the proposed study will enhance our                             
              understanding of the motion of drops in pipe flow.  In                         
              addition, the development of the modified CSF model will allow                 
                                                                                             
              the application of this model to the solution of other                         
              problems involving fluid-fluid interfaces.
