Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is the development of a theoretical             
              framework based on which a software tool can be developed to                   
              program and design systematically bit-level processor arrays.  The             
              resulting software tool should be portable and explore fully the               
              parallelism at bit-level and word-level which current system                   
              software of bit level systems lacks or does not fully explore.  It             
              can reduce significantly the programming burdens on users and                  
              improve the situation that only a low percentage of the performance            
              offered by hardware is utilized because of the insufficient support            
              of system software.  The class of algorithms for which the                     
              theoretical framework is developed are frequently used in digital              
              signal processing, image processing and other scientific                       
              computations.  This project is divided into three steps: (1)                   
              expanding the conventional algorithm at word-level into bit-level              
              to explore the parallelism at bit-level; (2) analyzing the                     
              parallelism and dependence structure of these n-dimensional (often             
              four or five dimensional) bit-level algorithms (algorithms with n              
              nested loops); (3) finding time-optimal mapping into (k-l)                     
              dimensional (often two dimensional) bit-level processor arrays                 
              without computational conflicts based on the dependence structure.
