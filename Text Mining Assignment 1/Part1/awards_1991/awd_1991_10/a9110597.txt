Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              For years, neurobiologists have speculated that the physical                   
              basis of learning and memory involves specific structural changes              
              in the brain, and, particularly, the growth of new neural                      
              connections.  But only within the last decade or so have the                   
              techniques of modern neurobiology been brought to bear on the                  
              problem of the morphological substrates of learning and memory.                
              Now, it is possible to directly visualize structural changes in                
              the intact, living nervous system while an animal is engaged in a              
              learning task.  Dr. David Glanzman is using optical recording and              
              video microscopy to gain a deeper understanding of the cellular                
              mechanisms of learning and memory.  He is utilizing an                         
              invertebrate preparation while studying sensorimotor synapses                  
              reconstituted in dissociated cell culture.  The dynamic cellular               
              changes observed in these studies may provide mechanistic roles                
              for specific biochemical and molecular events associated with                  
              learning.
