Abstract    :
              Different soil treatment methods may be used                                   
              for new construction to minimize damage due                                    
              to strong earthquakes.  Little formal research                                 
              exists to assist in the analysis of the proper soil                            
              improvement technique to use, though many                                      
              advances have occurred through innovative                                      
              construction techniques developed by specialty                                 
              contractors.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This project involves a collaboration between                                  
              Professor Maher of Rutgers University and Mr.                                  
              Joseph Welsh of Hayward Baker Inc., an                                         
              internationally-recognized specialty contractor                                
              in soil improvement and foundation                                             
              remediation.  The objective of this                                            
              collaboration is to study the behavior of                                      
              treated soils subjected to high strain cyclic                                  
              loads such as those experienced during                                         
              earthquakes.  Dynamic properties, that is,                                     
              shear moduli and damping characteristics, of                                   
              both admixture and grout-treated soils are                                     
              being investigated to assess: a) the potential of                              
              soil treatment as a viable option in the                                       
              mitigation of earthquake hazards, and b) the                                   
              response of existing treated soil-structure                                    
              systems to earthquake loads.
