Abstract    :
              The design, construction and operation of facilities in extreme                
              environments present difficult problem, shared among a diverse                 
              group of architects, engineers, scientists and managers.  Example              
              of efforts underway are the design of space and planetary stations,            
              facilities in and under water, research stations for the polar                 
              regions, and remote dwellings.  Although the environments are quite            
              different, many of the problems of supporting human life in these              
              environments are shared.  The exchange of experience and knowledge             
              among those working in this field can be valuable in addressing                
              these problems.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This grant provides partial support to a conference, the                       
              International Design for Extreme Environments Assembly, which will             
              take place at the University of Houston, November 12-15, 1991.  The            
              conference will provide a setting where experts from a variety of              
              countries and disciplines can meet to share information about                  
              solving practical problems, both for today and the future.
