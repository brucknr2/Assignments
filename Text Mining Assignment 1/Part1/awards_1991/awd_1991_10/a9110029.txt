Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to construct a unified formal model for         
              the study of heterogeneous distributed systems.  The approach will be          
              to conduct a systematic study of methods for structuring distributed           
              algorithms and their correctness proofs.  Each of these methods will           
              be carefully integrated into a single formal model so that it may be           
              used in combination with the other methods in novel ways to describe           
              complex systems.  The result will be a unified model, based on the I/O         
              automaton model of Lynch and Tuttle, that will be capable of                   
              describing a wide variety of distributed systems.  As a test of this           
              unified model, the project will develop an experimental programming            
              language and simulator that will describe heterogeneous systems within         
              the formal model and simulate executions of those systems. //
