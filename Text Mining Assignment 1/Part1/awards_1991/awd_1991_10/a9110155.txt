Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award will investigate novel                          
              approaches in millimeter wave power combining                                  
              structures.  Several new network-based and spatial                             
              power combining structures are proposed.  These                                
              circuits can combine the power generated by large                              
              number of three terminal devices in the millimeter-                            
              wave region.  The proposed power combining                                     
              structures are planar and periodic.  These combining                           
              structures are suitable for wafer scale integration.                           
              Also a two dimensional power combiner is proposed                              
              which uses Rucker's multi-device symmetrical                                   
              oscillator as a second level power combining circuit.                          
              In this case, more devices can be combined and the                             
              chip's real state can be used more efficiently.  The                           
              multiple device-circuit interaction for the proposed                           
              combiners will be investigated using Kurokawa's                                
              method and the criteria for stable operation will be                           
              determined.  These combiners will be designed and                              
              fabricated for operation at 35 GHz.  The noise                                 
              performance, frequency stability, reliability factors,                         
              effect of higher harmonics and power combining                                 
              efficiency of the proposed combining structures will                           
              be determined.
