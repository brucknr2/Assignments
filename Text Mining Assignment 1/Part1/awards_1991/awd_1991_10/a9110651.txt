Abstract    :
              The junctions of a rearrangement in which DNA sequences which are              
              noncontiguous in the germ line genome are joined during development            
              of the somatic nucleus have been cloned.  There is a long inverted             
              repeat near the rearrangement junctions which contains two                     
              different 19bp tandemly repeated sequences.  The 19mers are also               
              associated with each other at other rearrangement sites, which                 
              suggests that they have a functional role in rearrangement.                    
              Molecular analysis of the rearrangement junctions and of the                   
              products of rearrangements from the macronucleus will be extended              
              in order to determine the full length of the inverted repeat and               
              the nucleotide sequence at junction sites.  Cis-acting sequences               
              for DNA rearrangement will be identified by analysis of DNA                    
              rearrangement on constructs microinjected into developing                      
              macronuclei.  Cis-acting sequences will be used in gel-shift assays            
              to identify sites which are specifically bound by proteins during              
              DNA rearrangement.                                                             
                                                                                             
              DNA rearrangement is a basic biological process which occurs in a              
              variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals.  The goal of            
              the proposed study is to understand the molecular mechanisms                   
              involved in developmentally regulated rearrangement in the ciliated            
              protozoan Tetrahymena.***//
