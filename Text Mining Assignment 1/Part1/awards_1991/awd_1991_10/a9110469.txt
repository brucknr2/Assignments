Abstract    :
              A Research Initiation Award will support research on the behavior              
              of thin films of lubricants on magnetic memory storage hard disks.             
              Thin films of various polyfluoropolyether will be applied to disks             
              with carbon overcoats.  The head-disk friction will be monitored               
              for various conditions of speed and load and the gradual thinning              
              of the lubricant film will be measured using automatic                         
              ellipsometry.  A model will be developed for the effect of a                   
              lubricant's viscosity on its performance as a thin-film lubricant.
