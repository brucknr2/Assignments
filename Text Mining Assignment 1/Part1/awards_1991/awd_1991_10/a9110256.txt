Abstract    :
              The high temperature oxidation stability of silicon carbide                    
              ceramics which have been implanted with oxide-forming ions,                    
              such as aluminum and chromium, will be studied in this                         
              Research Initiation Award.  Implantation will be performed                     
              at elevated temperature and the microstructural and                            
              compositional changes will be monitored.  The interfacial                      
              reactions and the mass transport during subsequent oxidation                   
              exposures will be determined from these changes and also                       
              modeled from thermodynamic considerations.
