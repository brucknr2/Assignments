Abstract    :
              Developing valid predictions of the likely impacts of human                    
              response to global warming requires a realistic set of assumptions             
              about the process by which humans react to global warming.  These              
              assumptions must incorporate knowledge about human limitations in              
              information processing and learning.  This project aims to develop             
              a theoretical framework that can serve as the basis for such a set             
              of assumptions by focussing on agricultural decisions.                         
              Specifically the project examines the relationship between                     
              individual(farm-level) decisions about production and management               
              versus perceptions about weather and climate, especially                       
              perceptions about changes in climate(i.e., global warming.)  These             
              studies will also investigate the set of conditions that provide               
              for optimal learning, i.e., best usage of climate (and climate                 
              change) information, and thus also have prescriptive implications.
