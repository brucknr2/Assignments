Abstract    :
              This research studies the role and the performance of multi-level              
              caches in scalable shared memory multiprocessors.  The objectives              
              of this project are:  (1) evaluate and characterize performance of             
              multi-level caches for multiprocessors as a function of cache                  
              parameters, cache coherency protocol, and program characteristics              
              using trace-driven simulations; (2) evaluate cost-performance                  
              tradeoffs in selecting various multi-level cache configurations for            
              scalable shared memory architectures using different workload                  
              parameters; (3) investigate and develop trace reduction and                    
              sampling techniques to speed up simulations to study multi-level               
              cache performance in multiprocessors;(4) develop analytical models             
              to evaluate performance of multi-level caches in scalable                      
              architectures; and (5) investigate what minimal set of                         
              characteristic metrics must be measured to predict multi-level                 
              cache performance over a wide range of cache parameters.
