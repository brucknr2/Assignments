Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is is to develop a neural                       
              network trained from numerical simulations to model the                        
              stress diffusion in a granular soil based on the loading,                      
              soil fabric, stress field and stress history. Loadings to                      
              be studied include footings and laterally loaded piles. A                      
              photoelastic experimental study  will be used to to verify                     
              results. Such a trained network would not only be able to                      
              reproduce the examples from which it was taught, but through                   
              its ability to generalize it, would also be able to find                       
              solutions to an entire set of problems that it has  not                        
              previously encountered.
