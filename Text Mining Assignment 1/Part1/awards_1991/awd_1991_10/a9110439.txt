Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research program has two objectives: The immediate                        
              goal is to generate realistic analytical and computer models                   
              for determining the three-dimensional earthquake response                      
              of sedimentary basins using massively-parallel                                 
              supercomputers.  The aim is to obtain an understanding of                      
              the time and spatial distribution of earthquake-induced                        
              surface ground motions within populated basins, such as the                    
              Los Angeles basin, or the San Francisco Bay area.  The                         
              ultimate objective is to derive analytical models that provide,                
              with sufficient accuracy, the ground motions needed in the                     
              design of constructed facilities.                                              
                                                                                             
              This feasibility study addresses these objectives by                           
              investigating the needed computer requirements, computer                       
              methodologies, and modeling techniques.  It represents a                       
              benchmark on how far currently available advanced                              
              computer software and hardware can be used toward the                          
              ultimate objective; and a means of determining the direction                   
              of further advances needed to meet this objective.
