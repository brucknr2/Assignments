Abstract    :
              This project will design, implement, and evaluate a system that                
              integrates planning, execution, and learning in real time.  The                
              four main objectives to this research are: (1) Develop a usable                
              execution monitor that will control plan execution in real time;               
              (2) Develop the methods to plan directly from episodes in                      
              memory;(3) Automate the acquisition of cases from execution; and               
              (4) Develop techniques for learning using a weak domain theory.                
              The system's domain is meal planning and preparation.  The system              
              will plan and assist in the preparation of meals, then                         
              incorporate the results of these into its case memory.  A central              
              concern here is to design a system that is efficient enough to                 
              operate in real time.  This will be attained in part by placing                
              computational restrictions on time-critical processes, and in                  
              part by using a case-based approach to plan generation and repair              
              that use episodic representations of previous executions.  The                 
              detail in the resultant plans and repairs simplifies both                      
              execution monitoring and case acquisition.  Learning is done at                
              noncritical times, and is done without a strong domain theory by               
              attributing expectation failures to failures in the assumptions                
              used to generate the expectations.
