Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research on elections has concentrated on the behavior and choices             
              of individual voters.  However, questions about the roles played               
              by candidates and their campaigns as influences on voters typically            
              have been ignored.  Yet voter choice can only be understood within             
              the context of a campaign and is properly conceived as a result at             
              least in part of a contest between competing candidates.  This                 
              innovative research attempts to measure the impact of campaign                 
              strategies on voter choice in U.S. Senate elections.                           
                                                                                             
              Specifically, this research will collect data on the campaign                  
              behavior of US Senate candidates in the 1988, 1990 and 1992                    
              elections.  Candidate activities and positions will be determined              
              based on newspaper coverage of the campaigns.  These data will be              
              merged with data on voter attitudes in these campaigns thus                    
              permitting assessments of the extent to which candidate positions              
              are perceived by voters and influence their decisions.                         
                                                                                             
              When completed this study will greatly enhance our understanding               
              of the impact of campaigns on voter choice including the impact of             
              negative campaigning and of campaigns in which candidates offer                
              choices, not echoes.
