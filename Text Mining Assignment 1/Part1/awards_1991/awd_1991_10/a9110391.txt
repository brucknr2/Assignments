Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Cunningham's              
              research on a novel IP3-dependent protein kinase which Dr.                     
              Cunningham has discovered in erythrocyte membranes.  This is the               
              first report of a direct role for IP3 in protein phosphorylation,              
              and as such is potentially extremely important.  Dr. Cunningham                
              has proposed a model which links IP3-dependent protein                         
              phosphorylation with the known signal-transducing function of IP3,             
              namely the opening of calcium channels.                                        
                                                                                             
              If successful, the purification and characterization of an IP3-                
              dependent protein kinase is anticipated to have significant impact             
              on the field of signal transduction, as well as significantly                  
              enhance Dr. Cunningham's career.
