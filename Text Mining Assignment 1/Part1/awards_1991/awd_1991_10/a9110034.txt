Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the topic of robust control of mechanical              
              systems.  Robustness is required because of the nonlinear and                  
              uncertain character of such systems.  The robust control problem               
              is the problem of designing a fixed, or deterministic state                    
              feedback control to stabilize a dynamical system with significant              
              bounded uncertainties while meeting the design requirements.  The              
              Lyapunov approach to robustness, one of several currently popular              
              approaches, will be used in this project.  Current shortcomings                
              associated with the approach include (1) the control makes the                 
              system only  uniformly ultimately bounded and not asymptotically               
              stable, (2) the control only applies to systems which satisfy the              
              so called 'matching condition', and (3) it is usually necessary                
              to make assumptions about the allowable size of the system                     
              uncertainties.  The objectives of this project are to overcome                 
              these shortcomings.  The research is aimed at making robust                    
              control of nonlinear systems a practical tool.
