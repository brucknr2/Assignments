Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Guerinot's                
              proposed research on iron uptake in the model higher plant,                    
              Arabidopsis thaliana, using biochemical, genetic, and molecular                
              genetic approaches.   Dr. Guerinot has long-standing interest in               
              iron metabolism, and has until now focussed on iron uptake and                 
              metabolism in the Bradyrhizobium/soybean symbiosis, with particular            
              emphasis on iron uptake and iron-stress physiology in the bacterial            
              partner.  She would like to expand her research to investigations              
              of iron uptake and metabolism in the plant partner.  To facilitate             
              these studies, she has proposed to work on Arabidopsis as a model              
              system, with the intention of ultimately transferring knowledge                
              gained through these studies to studies of the soybean.                        
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that this new line of research will significantly            
              enhance Dr. Guerinot's career.
