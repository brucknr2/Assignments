Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop new and improved techniques that                 
              might be of special use in analyzing time-varying biological                   
              signals.  The approach is to design appropriate kernels to be                  
              used in time-frequency representation of signals, a                            
              representation that is a generalization of the classical Fourier               
              transform.  The new method is expected to provide an improved                  
              description of signals whose characteristics vary with time.  The              
              proposed research will investigate the use of these techniques                 
              for the analysis of biomedical signals:  EEG in epileptic                      
              patients, joint sounds in patients with joint problems, and                    
              evoked potentials in phobic patients.  The research, if                        
              successful, will result in a set of new analytic techniques for                
              characterizing signals, and the demonstration of the usefulness                
              of these techniques for diagnostic purposes.
