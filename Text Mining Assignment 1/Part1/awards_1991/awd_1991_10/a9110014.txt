Abstract    :
              This award supports the international collaborative aspects                    
              of research on diamond anvil cell dielectric measurements                      
              between Hugo Schmidt, University of Montana, and Bao Zhongxing,                
              Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Physics. This work                   
              is applicable to enhanced physical understanding of the                        
              field of proton glasses.  This collaboration draws on the                      
              expertise of Dr. Schmidt in ferroelectricity and Dr. Bao in                    
              diamond anvil cells.  Primary support for the research is                      
              provided under DMR 9017429.
