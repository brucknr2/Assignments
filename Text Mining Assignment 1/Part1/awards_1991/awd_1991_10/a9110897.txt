Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research by Dr. Woollacott is aimed at the hypothesis that the            
              development of balance control and walking requires the maturation             
              of a number of body systems, including the nervous system, muscular            
              system and skeletal system. The specific aim is to measure the                 
              times at which individual components (neural, muscular and                     
              skeletal) develop amd mature, in order to determine which                      
              components are the last to develop and thus limit the emergence of             
              stance. This project is a longitudinal study of the development of             
              balance in individual children from 8 to 18 months of age.                     
              Measurements will include: 1) the muscle activation patterns used              
              in balance, 2) the movements of the individual body parts during               
              balance, 3) the use of vision, vestibular (inner ear), and                     
              proprioceptive (muscle sensation) senses in balance control, 4)                
              changes in muscle strength, and 5) changes in body size and body               
              proportions, across the age range of 8 to 18 months. These                     
              experiments will allow the creation of a model of postural                     
              development, including a time frame of maturation of individual                
              body subcomponents, which will be useful in predicting the                     
              development of balance and walking abilites in children. This work             
              will contribute to understanding the emergence and maturation of               
              independent standing and walking in children.
