Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will deploy an array of four moored                    
              profiling current meters (PCM) in support of the intensive                     
              observation period (IOP) for TOGA-COARE.  Each mooring will                    
              measure temperature, salinity, and velocity fluctuations between               
              about 20 meters and 200 meters' depth at regular intervals for a               
              period of one year.  Characterization of these fluctuations will               
              be used to study the response of the upper ocean to variations in              
              surface forcing, using the vast array of supporting measurements               
              to be made during the COARE IOP.
