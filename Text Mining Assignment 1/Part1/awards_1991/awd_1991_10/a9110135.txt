Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to support the acquisition               
              by Dr. Head of basic molecular biology techniques and skills and               
              to subsequently establish these procedures in her laboratory.  Dr.             
              Head will accomplish this by spending time in the laboratories of              
              three experienced molecular biologists: Dr. Linette Casey,                     
              University of Texas Southestern Medical School; Dr. W. Sue Griffin,            
              University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; and Dr. Joan Hunt,                
              University of Kansas Medical Center.  Dr. Head will then apply                 
              these techniques to studies of immune function at the maternal-                
              fetal interface.                                                               
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that the proposed training and research                      
              activities will lead to significant advances in the field of                   
              reproductive immunology, and will significantly enhance Dr. Head's             
              career.
