Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on a concept for                          
              improving the rate at which petroleum hydrocarbons with a                      
              high-carbon content, can be removed from soil that has                         
              been contaminated by leakage from underground storage                          
              tanks.  The investigator plans on evaluating anionic                           
              surfactants that have an enhanced affinity for the target                      
              hydrocarbons because of their chemical structure, and                          
              comparing their performance in this respect with cationic                      
              and nonionic surfactants.  The investigator plans to                           
              includes the evaluation of surfactants with the use of                         
              micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration, a surfactant-based                          
              separation process for treatment of the wash water after                       
              it has been circulated through the contaminated soil.                          
              This process in combination with the appropriate anionic                       
              surfactant has the potential of providing for recovery of                      
              the surfactant for reuse in the soil-decontamination                           
              process.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This proposal was submitted in response to Program                             
              Announcement NSF 88-99, Research Initiation Awards.                            
              Results are expected to improve the engineering design of                      
              chemical remediation systems that are used to remove                           
              petroleum hydrocarbons from soil that has been                                 
              contaminated by leakage of petroleum hydrocarbons from                         
              storage tanks.
