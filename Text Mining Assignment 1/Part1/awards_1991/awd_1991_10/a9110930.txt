Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is aimed at a precise understanding of the micro- and            
              macromechanical descriptions of large strain deformation and                   
              failure of ductile heterophase microstructures.  Emphasis is on                
              deformation processes at, or near, interfaces and on the failure of            
              interfaces in composite materials.  Specific objectives include (1)            
              development of large strain, strain-rate dependent theory and                  
              predictive models for composite structures; (2) application of the             
              models to the deformation and failure of the microstructures; (3)              
              experimental studies of deformation and failure in metal-matrix                
              composite materials; (4) experimental studies of deformation at bi-            
              material interfaces and analysis of their fracture resistance; (5)             
              related effects of residual stresses developed during the                      
              processing on deformation and failure mechanisms.

              This research relates to structural metal alloys and composites                
              that employ interfaces to control mechanical behavior and/or                   
              surface coatings to create improved properties.
