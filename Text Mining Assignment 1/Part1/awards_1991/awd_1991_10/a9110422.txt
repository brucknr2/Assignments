Abstract    :
              The proposed work is part of an integrated research program into               
              the oceanographic structure of the western Weddell Sea.  It is to              
              be carried out from an ice camp jointly occupied by U.S. and USSR              
              scientists from February to June 1992.  The work proposed here is              
              an effort to define the vertical and horizontal thermohaline                   
              fluxes within the western part of the Weddell Gyre.                            
              Specifically, instrument clusters capable of measuring the                     
              Reynolds stress and the turbulent heat flux directly will be                   
              suspended from the ice at the camp and maintained throughout the               
              duration of the drift.  Also, a remote buoy to measure upper                   
              ocean temperature, salinity and current structure will be                      
              emplaced to make observations on the larger scale variability                  
              within which the turbulence data is embedded.  The measurements                
              will be used in conjunction with other concurrent experiments to               
              quantify the energy brought to the underside of the ice and form               
              part of the flux of energy from the ocean through the sea ice                  
              cover to the atmosphere.
