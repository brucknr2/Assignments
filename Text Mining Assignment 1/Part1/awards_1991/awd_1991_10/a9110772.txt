Abstract    :
              There is now potential to synthesize circuits which contain                    
              Exclusive OR (EXOR) gates without the size and speed penalties                 
              formerly associated with them.  Circuits designed with EXOR                    
              technology can be efficiently implemented and are inherently                   
              testable.  Three research topics are being pursued.  The first is              
              to develop a comprehensive theory for design in the EXOR                       
              technology.  This theory forms the basis for development of                    
              algorithms for EXOR design.  Second is to develop a tool which                 
              produces an optimal, multilevel design that is a mixture of EXOR,              
              OR and AND gates for a given function.  Hierarchal decomposition               
              is being used to recognize different subfunctions.  Algorithms are             
              being developed for decomposition, factorization, and resynthesis.             
              Third is to explore algorithms for optimal design using                        
              programmable gate arrays and programmable logic devices.
