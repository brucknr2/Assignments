Abstract    :
              Infrared and Raman spectroscopy, when combined with normal mode                
              analysis, provides a powerful tool for studying structure and                  
              morphology of macromolecules.  Rigorous methods of analysis and                
              their applications.  The present proposal extends in several new               
              directions.  (1) The recent analysis of the longitudinal acoustic              
              mode (LAM) of low-molecular-weight poly(ethylene oxide) will be                
              extended to higher-molecular-weight samples, whose LAM spectra                 
              indicate the presence of complex folded-chain morphologies.  (2)               
              The recently refined comprehensive vibrational force field for                 
              multiply-chlorinated hydrocarbons.  Will be used to analyze the                
              conformational structure in chlorinated poly(vinyl chloride) and to            
              determine the chain conformation of poly(vinylidene chloride).  (3)            
              Ab initio studies of force fields will be extended to two problems:            
              the determination of the force field of hydrogen-bonded amide                  
              groups, and the development of molecular mechanics energy functions            
              that, following their recently demonstrated mathematical                       
              transformation, permit the accurate reproduction of spectroscopic              
              frequencies.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              These studies will advance their capabilities in using vibrational             
              spectra to study structure in macromolecules, as well as enhance               
              their understanding of specific polymeric systems.
