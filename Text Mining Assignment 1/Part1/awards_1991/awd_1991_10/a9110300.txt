Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Racowsky's                
              preliminary studies to investigate specific relationships in the               
              mammalian ovarian follicle among steroidogenic output of granulosa             
              cells, modulation of this output by growth factors, and the                    
              stimulation of meiotic resumption in oocytes.  She hypothesizes                
              that growth factors paly a central role in the stimulation of                  
              meiotic resumption throught their modulation of gonadotropin-                  
              regulation of cumulus cell steroidogenesis.                                    
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that the proposed research activities will lay               
              the groundwork for important contributions to the field of                     
              mammalian oocyte maturation, which will significantly enhance Dr.              
              Racowsky's career.
