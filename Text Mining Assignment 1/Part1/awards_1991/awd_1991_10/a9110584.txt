Abstract    :
              This research address the problem of relational query                          
              optimization for general purpose parallel machines.  The                       
              principle objective of this project to develop query optimizer                 
              that will generate efficient query plans for parallel machines.                
              The three main components of a database query optimizer are its                
              query plan representation, its cost model, and its search                      
              algorithm.  This project addresses the issue of developing a plan              
              representation that incorporates intra- and inter-operator                     
              parallelism, as well as pipelining.  Furthermore, cost models                  
              will be developed which distinguish between the total work done,               
              i.e. the (sequential) time it would take on a uni-processor and                
              total (parallel) time taken on a multi-processor.  The cost model              
              depends on the query and database parameters, as well as                       
              architecture parameters.  A cost-based search algorithm selects                
              efficient (low cost) query plans.  Since the search space is much              
              larger than that found in uni-processor query optimization, this               
              research will develop new heuristics to prune the search space.                
              Furthermore, since a multiprocessor is available, the research                 
              will also investigate applicability of parallel processing to the              
              optimization process itself.  The results of this research will                
              have an impact on efficient query processing in parallel                       
              relational databases.
