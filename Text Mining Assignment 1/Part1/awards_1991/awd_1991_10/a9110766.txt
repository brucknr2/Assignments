Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The ultimate goal of this research is to develop sophisticated                 
              compilers for parallel machines.  Memory latency is the focus of our           
              research because it is the bottleneck that drives many design                  
              decisions in parallel architectures today.  As systems become larger,          
              it is increasingly difficult to have all memory close to all                   
              processors which can increase effective memory latency.  Current               
              solutions for reducing memory latency can be categorized as either             
              dynamic or static.  Dynamic solutions include multi-caches and shared          
              virtual memory.  These methods are based on the assumption that                
              programs exhibit a high degree of locality and therefore, the cost of          
              servicing a cache miss or a page fault can be amortized over many              
              references that cache line or page.  Current static solutions rely on          
              the programmer to use memory efficiently.  Three related research              
              directions are proposed:  a static solution to the problem of                  
              reducing effective memory latency that requires much less detailed             
              knowledge of the machine by the programmer than present solutions,             
              the combination of static and dynamic techniques for reducing memory           
              latency, and static and dynamic methods for exploiting locality in             
              recursively defined dynamic data structures.//
