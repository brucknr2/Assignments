Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The goal of this research is to implement a new model for programming          
              scientific computations on distributed memory multiprocessors, called          
              lattice parallelism (LP).  LP is intended for scientific methods that          
              locally concentrate computational effort non-uniformly and                     
              unpredictably, for example, adaptive mesh methods.  It provides                
              high-level operations to hide the low-level details of dynamically             
              manipulating elaborate, dynamic data structures.  The objectives of            
              the research are to gain a better understanding of lattice                     
              parallelism under realistic conditions; to apply it to scientific              
              applications, and to explore run-time optimization techniques.  The            
              implementation and evaluation of LP will be carried out on the Intel           
              iPSC/860, running a variety of application codes at our disposal.              
                                                                                             
              A novel feature of lattice parallelism is that it exploits the                 
              tightly coupled local structure present in non-uniform calculations            
              and so avoids high communication overheads.  This is significant in            
              light of the ultimate emergence of massively parallel distributed              
              memory multiprocessors, which are especially sensitive to the effects          
              of communication overhead.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This research will result in the development of a software tool for            
              reducing the effort required to parallelize full scale numerical               
              software by an order of magnitude or better.//
