Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop a new                          
              approach for the modelling, analysis and design of                             
              stochastic discrete event dynamic systems (DEDS).                              
              The proposed approach is based on obtaining the                                
              Maclaurin series of the performance measure as a                               
              function of a decision parameter.  Our objectives are                          
              (i) to develop efficient recursive expressions for the                         
              Maclaurin coefficients for a large class of stochastic                         
              DEDS and (ii) to investigate the theoretical and                               
              practical implications of the obtained Maclaurin series.                       
              The results of this project would form a powerful                              
              complement to existing methodologies for stochastic                            
              DEDS.  In particular, we will develop simple closed                            
              form approximations of the performance measures for                            
              the purpose of analysis and design, as well as some                            
              stochastic DEDS modelling guidelines analogous to                              
              those in the classical Bode-Nyquist methodology for                            
              modelling continous variable dynamic systems.
