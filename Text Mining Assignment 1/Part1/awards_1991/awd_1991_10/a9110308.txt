Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A major instrumentation need in neurophysiology is the production              
              of new sensor interfaces between brain and electronic devices.                 
              Advances in multichannel sensing of neural activity, detection of              
              local levels of neurotransmitters, and other physiological                     
              parameters would be valuable as an evolutional step in studies of              
              the normal physiology of neural circuits.  Also, information on                
              the local pattern of activity within connected neural structures               
              and of local chemical release of neuromodulator substances will                
              be needed to devise control or communication strategies within                 
              and between neural structures to understand effective neural                   
              function.  A team of scientist at the University of Colorado,                  
              Denver and the University of Texas, Dallas are coordinating                    
              research activities which are developing biochemical probes and                
              the technology to record from 32 sites simultaneously in neural                
              tissue.  This action is to support their activities which deal                 
              with multi-electrode array (dagger) and connector construction                 
              and the writing of computer software essential for data                        
              acquisition and interpretation.
