Abstract    :
              This award is to fund an NSF research planning workshop on "The                
              Challenges of Computer Vision - Future Directions in Computer                  
              Vision Research" to be held immediately following the 1990 IEEE                
              Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition in Maui,                 
              Hawaii in June 1991.  Junior and senior researchers in computer                
              vision will be invited to participate in this workshop, which                  
              will address basic research needs and recommend future directions              
              that should be emphasized, and will also examine enabling tools                
              and technologies which can most contribute to progress in                      
              computer vision.  A report of findings will later be produced and              
              distributed widely.
