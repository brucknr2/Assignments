Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to complete the                                             
              development of a new electrode array to                                        
              stimulate neurons in the cerebral cortex.                                      
              The 10x10 silicon-based array, arranged as a                                   
              "brush" on a 4.2 mm square base, will contain                                  
              circuitry to reduce the number of lead-wires.                                  
              The electrodes then will be implanted into                                     
              the somatosensory cortex of cats to evaluate                                   
              durability and biocompatibility for use as                                     
              both recording and stimulating devices.                                        
              Although the eventual goal of the project is                                   
              to use such electrodes for the electrical                                      
              stimulation of blind individuals to partially                                  
              restore some visual sensation, the electrode                                   
              array should be also useful for recording                                      
              information from deep cortical structures.
