Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the application of microwave                     
              heating for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.  Two                     
              applications are planned:  ablation of cardiac tissue responsible              
              for tachycardia, and removal of coronary plague (angioplasty).                 
              The microwave energy will be delivered through miniature antennas              
              introduced through catheters.  Initial efforts will concentrate                
              on antenna design; the design will be then tested in a small                   
              number of animal experiments.  If successful, the project will                 
              result in the development of new minimally invasive surgical                   
              techniques.
