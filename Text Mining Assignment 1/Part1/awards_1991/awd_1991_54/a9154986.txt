Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Kentucky will initiate a three-week, residential             
              Young Scholars project in Engineering which will offer science                 
              enrichment activities for 30 precollege students entering grades               
              11,12.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize research participation in                   
              chemical, civil, electrical and mechanical engineering.  Lectures              
              and demonstrations in basic engineering principles, hands-on                   
              computer experiences, field trips featuring a day of shadowing an              
              engineer in an industrial plant, and mini-research group projects              
              all integrated with one another will form the core of the program.             
              Students will complete an individual project of engineering                    
              relevance during the Fall semester at their home schools.
