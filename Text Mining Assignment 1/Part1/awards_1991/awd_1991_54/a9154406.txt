Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The K-12 mathematics and science "frameworks" now emphasize                    
              problem solving skills and conceptual understanding.  This                     
              has stimulated the development of performance tests because                    
              they are better measures of these skills than the multiple                     
              choice items relied upon in the past to assess student                         
              achievement.  However, information about performance                           
              measures is sparse and fragmented.                                             
                                                                                             
              The proposed project will examine the cost, technical                          
              quality feasibility, and acceptability of alternative                          
              assessment systems (i.e., testing programs that include                        
              combinations of measures for making decisions about                            
              individuals, instructional programs, or state and national                     
              trends).  The project will gather and analyze data on the                      
              performance and other types of measures used by the                            
              California Assessment Project and other such programs.  The                    
              study will examine the statistical properties of these                         
              measures, the resources required to develop and use them,                      
              and the attitudes of students, teachers, and others to their                   
              inclusion in testing programs.  The study also will develop                    
              several tasks from the same "shell."  Data on these measures                   
              will be used to investigate the sensitivity of these tasks                     
              to the effects of instruction and practice.  The project's                     
              final report will discuss the key features and implications                    
              of alternative assessment systems.
