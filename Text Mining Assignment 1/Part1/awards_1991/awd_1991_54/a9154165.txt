Abstract    :
              A 3-day national residential workshop will provide 25 faculty                  
              from across the country a sustained, intensive, and hands-on                   
              experience using the HP-48SX graphics programmable calculator                  
              to increase their capability to teach up-to-date calculator                    
              enhanced courses in single-variable calculus, multi-variable                   
              calculus, differential equations, linear algebra and                           
              statistics. The participants will work closely with the                        
              workshop personnel to learn the new ideas, techniques, and                     
              pedagogy required to effectively integrate high-level graphics                 
              programmable calculators into the first two years of collegiate                
              mathematics. Participants will take home course supplementary                  
              materials in all five focus areas, will be allowed to borrow                   
              for a two-week period during the academic year a set of HP-48SX                
              calculators for classroom use, and will be offered a deep-                     
              discount price to purchase an HP-48SX to help them begin to                    
              incorporate the substance of the workshop on their own                         
              campuses.
