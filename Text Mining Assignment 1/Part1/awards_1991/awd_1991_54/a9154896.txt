Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Erskine College will initiate a four-week, residential Young                   
              Scholars project in Computer Interfacing and Biotechnology for 36              
              students entering grades 10-12.                                                
                                                                                             
              18 students will develop expertise in computer interfacing and                 
              learn to apply this technology in the areas of meteorology, modern             
              physics, acoustics, chemistry, robotics and assistance for the                 
              disabled.  The other 18 students will develop expertise in                     
              biotechnology as they apply tissue culture and cloning to botany               
              and plant development, apply radiotelemetric to field studies of               
              the ecological zoology of small mammals and reptiles, and apply DNA            
              fingerprinting and genetic engineering to studies in molecular                 
              genetics.  Students will visit the Duke Power Nuclear Power Plant              
              and the IBM National Support Center for Persons with Disabilities.
