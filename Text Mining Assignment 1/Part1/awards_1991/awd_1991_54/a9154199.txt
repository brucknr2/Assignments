Abstract    :
              Statistics indicate that most astronomy teachers at two-year                   
              and four-year colleges are not full-time astronomers.  However,                
              these faculty annually teach a large number of astronomy                       
              students.  The purpose of this project is to enhance the                       
              faculty effectiveness of a number of astronomy instructors by                  
              assisting them to begin their own observational astronomy                      
              research programs.  The entry-level type of research can be                    
              mastered by physics-trained faculty members.  The data-                        
              gathering required for the type of research proposed can be                    
              undertaken by beginning-level undergraduates using the type of                 
              equipment found at small colleges.  The project will enrich                    
              educational experiences for a large number of undergraduate                    
              students who would not normally have such an opportunity.Two                   
              groups of fifteen college astronomy teachers come to the Center                
              for Astrophysics for a week-long workshop.  While at the                       
              Center, teachers learn the rudiments of photoelectric                          
              photometry, photoelectric and CCD (charged coupled device)                     
              observation of occultations.  The program gives the                            
              participants the necessary theory and background knowledge to                  
              allow them actually to do astronomical research and provide                    
              research opportunities for their students.
