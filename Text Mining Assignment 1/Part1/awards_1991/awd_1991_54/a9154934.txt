Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Hawaii at Manoa will initiate a six-week, summer             
              residential Young Scholars project in the Agricultural Sciences for            
              26 students entering grades 11 and 12.                                         
                                                                                             
              The Pacific Region Program (PRP) will focus on science in general              
              and the agricultural sciences in particular.  Students will be                 
              exposed to contemporary societal issues (e.g. world food problems,             
              environmental degradation, etc.) and will learn how knowledge from             
              research is used in generating solutions.  The PRP summer                      
              curriculum will consist of four inter-related active learning                  
              experiences:  classroom presentations; field trips; research with              
              mentors; and small group activities.  Students will conduct                    
              individual research projects under the guidance of scientists and              
              enhance their computer, library and communications skills.  they               
              will engage in analyzing and discussing real-world case studies and            
              ethics in science and explore the career opportunities in the                  
              field.
