Abstract    :
                   The field of evaluation has expanded quite rapidly over the               
              past twenty five years so that evaluation of programs is standard              
              practice in large organizations.  Relatively recently, school                  
              districts, state and federal agencies, and large organizations have            
              established internal evaluation staffs, procedures, and policies.              
              These offices of evaluation are being created in faith that they               
              will serve a useful function in improving science and mathematics              
              education.                                                                     
                   In their infancy, agencies tend to aggressively pursue their              
              mission.  Later they become facilitators between the larger                    
              organization and the constituency regulated or observed.  Finally,             
              they become an arm of their constituency.  If this is the normal               
              development path, the evaluation agencies may not, in the long                 
              term, continue to pursue their mission effectively.  No one knows,             
              except through anecdote, what issues and policies arise, how they              
              are disposed of, and how internal evaluation functions.                        
                   This study proposes to examine the development of mathematics             
              and science education evaluation issues, policies, and processes as            
              they develop over a five year period within the Directorate of                 
              Education and Human Resources (EHR), of the National Science                   
              Foundation.  By combining the results with evaluation theory, more             
              general perspectives on the development of evaluation within large             
              organizations should lead to deeper theory and understanding so                
              that evaluation can serve the anticipated role in large                        
              organizations.  The quality of evaluations in EHR may be                       
              facilitated by providing feedback from the study to people in EHR              
              annually.
