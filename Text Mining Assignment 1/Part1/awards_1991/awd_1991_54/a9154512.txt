Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop a model mathematics portfolio practice in            
              which cycles of productive activity and assessment recur throughout            
              each curriculum unit.  The model is grounded in work in                        
              developmental psychology that emphasizes social and cultural                   
              supports and the role of motivation in children's learning.  Two               
              studies are planned: (a)  a trial of portfolio practice to refine              
              it and the measures needed to evaluate it; (b)  a systematic                   
              comparison among classrooms that vary in curriculum approach and               
              portfolio use to evaluate the impact of portfolio practice on                  
              classroom instruction and assessment, on teachers' knowledge of                
              students' mathematical understandings and motivations, and on                  
              students' own understandings and motivations.  Research measures               
              include quantitative (group tasks, questionnaires) and qualitative             
              (individual tasks and interviews, videotapes of classroom                      
              practices, field notes) methods.  The work has import for diverse              
              audiences:  For educators, a completed set of materials for                    
              classroom portfolio assessment; for researchers, increased                     
              knowledge of fundamental  relations among assessment and                       
              instruction practices and teacher and student outcomes; for                    
              evaluation specialists, an effective system of classroom assessment            
              that has implications for the design of coordinated external                   
              assessments.
