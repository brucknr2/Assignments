Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This project involves the planning and conducting of a                         
              conference to render technical assistance to States and                        
              Territories which are developing initiatives for reforming                     
              mathematics, science, and technology education.  One                           
              component entails the analysis of proposals submitted under                    
              NSF's Statewide Systemic Initiatives Program and the                           
              development of materials for the conference, including a                       
              technical assistance document.  Another component focuses on                   
              the design and conducting of the conference itself.
