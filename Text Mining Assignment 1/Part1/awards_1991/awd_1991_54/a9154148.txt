Abstract    :
              This two-week workshop acquaints aerospace engineering faculty                 
              with current airplane design methodology from the conceptual                   
              design phase to the manufacturing phase, including                             
              technological, economic, market and manufacturing                              
              considerations.  As part of the workshop, the participants                     
              design an airplane and present the results of their design work                
              to an audience of industry experts.  These experts critique not                
              only the designs, but also the way in which the design results                 
              are presented.  The participants discuss methods of classroom                  
              implementation of the material learned.
