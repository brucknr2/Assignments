Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Middle School Mathematics through Applications Project is                  
              designed to create a community of math teachers, educators, and                
              math-using professionals to work together in ongoing seminars and              
              summer institutes to design, develop and test math materials and               
              activities based on real, everyday science and engineering                     
              problems.  The most advanced computer simulation technology will be            
              used in the materials.  New assessment practices will be                       
              established.  The project has four major foci:                                 
                                                                                             
                     i.  the creation of a new community of mathematics                      
              practices,                                                                     
                                                                                             
                    ii.  the creation of new learning materials and collaborative            
              activity structures                                                            
                                                                                             
                   iii.  the gradual design of new teaching and assessment                   
              practices, and                                                                 
                                                                                             
                    iv.  the development of cognitive and ethnographic research              
              in teaching and learning practices.                                            
                                                                                             
              This project will concentrate on middle school mathematics.  It is             
              a joint effort of the Institute for Research in Learning, the                  
              Stamford University College of Education, and Sandia Laboratories.
