Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Education Development Center, Inc.(EDC), in collaboration                      
              with the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB), will                        
              organize a conference designed to encourage and support the                    
              participation of ASCB members in pre-college science                           
              education reform.  This conference will provide a unique                       
              opportunity for a group of scientists to come together with                    
              science educators, teachers, school administrators, and                        
              other scientists already deeply engaged in precollege work                     
              to explore the nature of hands-on inquiry science teaching                     
              and how practicing scientists can contribute to national                       
              science reform.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The conference precedes the annual meeting of the ASCB in                      
              Boston, Massachusetts.  Its intensive three day program is                     
              designed for maximum of thirty participants and will                           
              include a mix of experiential sessions, presentations,                         
              panels, and discussions.  A report summarizing the                             
              conference activities and findings will be produced and                        
              disseminated to the full membership of the Society and to                      
              other scientific and educational audiences.                                    
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing for the conference will be eighteen                           
              percent of the NSF portion.
