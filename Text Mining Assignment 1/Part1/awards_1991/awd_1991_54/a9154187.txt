Abstract    :
              The major priorities of the workshop are to prepare                            
              experienced faculty from Historically Black Colleges and                       
              Universities to teach successful undergraduate courses in                      
              demography and population studies and to prepare such                          
              individuals to introduce modules on demography into existing                   
              courses.  Participants for this seminar will include                           
              sociology, economics, and geography faculty members with                       
              interest in teaching undergraduate demography courses. The                     
              seminar will prepare and enhance the faculty participants for                  
              teaching demography courses by updating their theoretical and                  
              empirical knowledge, introducing them the educational                          
              software, and developing appropriate syllabi to include                        
              materials for the course.
