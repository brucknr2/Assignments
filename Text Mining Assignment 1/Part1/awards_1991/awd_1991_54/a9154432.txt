Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to conduct the first large-                     
              scale national study of the introduction and use of                            
              portfolio assessment in pre-college mathematics instruction.                   
              The goal is to identify principles that can inform continued                   
              policy and program development and that can stimulate new                      
              initiatives in assessment, curriculum, and instruction.                        
              Focusing on states, districts, schools, and teachers as they                   
              experiment with portfolio assessment to measure student                        
              learning, the proposed research will examine these efforts                     
              and the ways they affect curriculum and instruction in                         
              mathematics.  The workplan, which spans 35 months, includes                    
              a national survey of activities to introduce portfolio                         
              assessment at state and local levels, a comprehensive review                   
              of the research on alternative assessment practices and                        
              materials in mathematics, and related innovations in                           
              curriculum and instruction, intensive case studies of five                     
              promising local programs, and extensive product development                    
              and dissemination strategies, supported by a partnership                       
              between Policy Studies Associates and the Council of Chief                     
              State School Officers, will ensure high quality products and                   
              their immediate dissemination through a national network of                    
              state and local practitioners and policy makers.
