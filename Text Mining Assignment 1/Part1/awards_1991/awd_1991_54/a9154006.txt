Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Little is known about how students and teachers can get high                   
              quality and equitable access to the educational and                            
              scientific resources that are becoming available on the                        
              Internet.  With the proposal of a new NSF program that will                    
              develop resources and virtual communities on Internet to                       
              support the widespread implementation of advanced                              
              technologies and curricula in science, math and engineering                    
              education, our lack of understanding of local communication                    
              infrastructures becomes an urgent concern.  This project                       
              will examine the technological and pedagogical                                 
              infrastructures that are required for teachers and students                    
              to make optimal use of these resources.  The exploratory                       
              research will investigate1) the major issues schools and                       
              materials developers will face in implementing programs                        
              making use of the Internet,2) models that are currently                        
              available for providing access 3) the current resources,                       
              capabilities and mechanisms of the Internet and 4) new                         
              developments and approaches that are most likely to provide                    
              maximum leverage in obtaining educational advantages from                      
              Internet resources.
