Abstract    :
                   A primary objective of this study is to develop a detailed                
              understanding of the nature of engineering research activities                 
              carried out in U.S. universities.  The study will characterize the             
              research that U.S. engineering school faculty members, research                
              staff, and students undertake in order to illuminate key issues                
              concerning the role of research within engineering education and               
              its relation to industry and government.  To achieve this                      
              objective, a classification scheme will be devised for categorizing            
              engineering school research along several dimensions which will be             
              applied to analyze engineering school research over time, comparing            
              and contrasting the situation today with condition 10 and 20 years             
              ago.  National surveys will be conducted of engineering faculty and            
              directors of engineering school research units to obtain                       
              information on the nature and outcomes of engineering school                   
              research.  Parallel studies will examine the impacts of engineering            
              school research utilizing structured content analysis of written               
              outputs and other techniques.  Policy options will be developed for            
              consideration by universities, industry and government at a Policy             
              Workshop that will be convened to address several key issues                   
              concerning engineering research in U.S. higher education and to                
              provide inputs to the final project report.
