Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The Pennsylvania State University will initiate a four-week,                   
              residential, interdisciplinary Young Scholars project for 72                   
              students entering grades 11 and 12.                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              Eight participants will be placed in on-going research laboratories            
              on projects leading to specific research goals.  The laboratory                
              experience will mimic today's real world, research and development             
              as a joint effort and teamwork.  There will be three different                 
              participating laboratories in each of the Colleges of Agriculture,             
              Earth and Mineral Sciences, and Science.  Collaborating engineering            
              faculty and graduate students will participate in each laboratory.             
              To encourage interaction between participants, the composition of              
              the groups for other planned activities will be different from that            
              of the research-team groups and different from each other.  These              
              activities include:  communication skills, research methodology,               
              envisioning quantitative information, library techniques, research             
              talks, career panels, career mentoring by graduate students, open              
              house at the four colleges involved, science teaching as a career,             
              career counseling, gender issues discussion, science and                       
              engineering course requirements and descriptions, the social                   
              context of technology, and an all-day research retreat.
