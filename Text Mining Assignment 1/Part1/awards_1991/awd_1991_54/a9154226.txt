Abstract    :
              During the last three decades, great strides have been made in                 
              the understanding of our dynamic planet.  The concept of plate                 
              tectonics is one of the most revolutionary advances in science                 
              and has completely changed the way geologists look at the                      
              Earth.  One of the most important areas in the development of                  
              the concept of plate tectonics is the Appalachian Orogen.The                   
              workshop will focus on an understanding of the tectonic                        
              elements and timing of the Appalachian Orogen by examining                     
              geologic transect through the Southern Appalachian Orogen in                   
              North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia and the far Northern                   
              Appalachian Orogen across Newfoundland. In addition, the                       
              Northern Appalachian Orogen  will be examined in less detail.
