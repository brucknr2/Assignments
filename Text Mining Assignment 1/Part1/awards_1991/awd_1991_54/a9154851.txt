Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year teacher enhancement project for secondary                      
              (middle school or high school) teachers includes an exchange                   
              component, in which during each semester of the project one                    
              university faculty member and one secondary school teacher                     
              will be selected to co-teach a mathematics class at both the                   
              school and the university level.  The university participant                   
              will also visit other classes and work with teachers in the                    
              school setting; the school participant will also work with                     
              faculty and take one university mathematics course at the                      
              university.  The project also includes a series of summer                      
              seminars with the exchange participants, which will be                         
              offered for twenty educators from schools in the surrounding                   
              area. In these three week seminars the participants will                       
              experience the use of innovative teaching materials and                        
              methods as they explore topics in mathematics and will                         
              discuss many of the major issues facing mathematics education                  
              today.  Follow-up activities for all participants will                         
              continue during each academic year.
