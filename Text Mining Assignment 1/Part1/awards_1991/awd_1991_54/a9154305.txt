Abstract    :
              MIT is conducting a two-week summer workshop for college and                   
              university physics faculty to exchange ideas and designs for                   
              advanced pedagogical experiments in modern physics and to study                
              the experiments currently in use in the MIT Junior Physics                     
              Laboratory (the third-year course in experimental physics                      
              required for MIT physics majors) for the purpose of evaluating                 
              them for possible reproduction and use in similar courses at                   
              their home institutions. The MIT Junior Lab experiments are                    
              designed for students who have completed an introductory course                
              in modern physics and are taking concurrently an introductory                  
              course in quantum mechanics.  The experiments provide hands-on                 
              experience with the phenomena of particle, nuclear, atomic,                    
              condensed matter, statistical, and astro-physics.  The summer                  
              workshop will assist in the national effort to improve the                     
              quality of undergraduate physics education.  This project                      
              responds to a suggestion, put forward at the Santa Fe Workshop                 
              on Undergraduate Curriculum Development (June 1-3, 1990), that                 
              universities with excellent advanced undergraduate laboratory                  
              courses should organize summer workshops like the current one.
