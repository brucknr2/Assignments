Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Pennsylvania will continue its four-week,                    
              residential/commuter Young Scholars project in Biology, Mathematics            
              and Computer Science for 54 students entering grades 10 and 11.                
                                                                                             
              Participants are involved in biology-related laboratory projects,              
              directed by University faculty and assisted by undergraduate                   
              students, and attend related lectures on DNA, hemoglobin, hormone              
              binding and the nervous system.  Mathematics classes and problem-              
              solving sessions taught by University faculty explore current areas            
              of research including topology, networks, fractals, exponential                
              growth and decay, probability and combinatorics.  In Computer Lab,             
              also taught by University faculty, students learn elements of                  
              Pascal and work on developing algorithms to solve challenging                  
              problems.
