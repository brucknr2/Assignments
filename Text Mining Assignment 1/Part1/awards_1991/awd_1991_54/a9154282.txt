Abstract    :
              The next Summer School for Chemical Engineering Faculty,                       
              jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation and                       
              Industry is  organized by the Chemical Engineering Division of                 
              the American Society for Engineering Education.It will be held                 
              in the Summer of 1992.  Attendance by about 250 faculty members                
              is anticipated, representing nearly every chemical engineering                 
              department in the United States.  The purpose of the project                   
              sponsored Summer School is to achieve more effective and                       
              realistic chemical engineering education by stimulating an                     
              exchange of ideas and approaches among chemical engineering                    
              faculty members and practicing engineers.  Past  Summer Schools                
              have fostered major innovations in the chemical engineering                    
              curriculum; the development of new teaching methods and                        
              classroom activities have also been encouraged.  The format of                 
              the Summer School includes organized workshops and plenary                     
              sessions . Continuous opportunity for informal discussion among                
              participants also is provided. Eminent engineers from                          
              universities and industry will be involved in the organization                 
              and presentation of the Summer School.The subjects to be                       
              covered represent areas of new and renewed emphasis in chemical                
              engineering education .The Summer School offers the opportunity                
              to examine and influence the direction of chemical engineering                 
              education in the United States.  Chemical engineers who are                    
              capable of meeting modern societal demands and economic needs                  
              in areas such as energy, environment, food, biotechnology,                     
              medicine, microelectronics, material resources, and other areas                
              are needed.  The Summer School syllabus is specifically                        
              designed to help meet this urgent need.
