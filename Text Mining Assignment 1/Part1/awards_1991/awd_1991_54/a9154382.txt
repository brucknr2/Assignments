Abstract    :
              9154382  Gregory    Decision Science specialists at Decision Science Research
              Institute  together with teachers at the Eugene (oregon) 4-J School District 
              are developing ten to twelve modules focussing on teaching  decision-making
              skills to secondary school students.  The project  focuses on decision making
              in science areas related to human health  and to the environment.  Students
              will learn to represent decision  opportunities in terms of expected
              consequences of different  choices and the perceived desirability of those
              choices.  The  material will present the four themes of decision thinking, 
              structuring, uncertainty and tradeoffs and show that values are  important and
              decision making is purposeful, there are future  events that cannot be
              controlled or predicted, personal choices  have an influence on future
              directions, and different choices  result in different benefits, risks and
              costs.  Instructional  modules will be developed and evaluated on the basis of
              their  success in encouraging better decisions as well as their ability to 
              enhance decision making skills in science domains.  Dissemination  will be
              conducted with assistance from the International Society  for Technology in
              Education.  ***
