Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year project uses science performance test data                     
              collected under the auspices of the California Assessment Program              
              (CAP) to refine and apply new methods for scoring performance                  
              tests and for modeling cognitive abilities.  After working with                
              data and for modeling cognitive abilities.  After working with                 
              data already collected, the PI will collaborate with CAP                       
              personnel to incorporate features into future performance tests                
              that will facilitate the forms of analysis proposed.  The                      
              analytical methods to be developed involved modeling underlying                
              abilities in terms of discrete states, rather than continue.                   
              Task performance is likewise represented in terms of discrete                  
              states, and mappings are derived from ability states to task                   
              performance states.  Representations and mappings are in terms of              
              partially ordered sets, distributive lattices, and related                     
              mathematical structures.  Restricted latent class models are used              
              to make inferences about true task performance state and true                  
              ability state in the presence of random classification errors.
