Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Mountain Empire Community College will initiate a four-week,                   
              multidisciplinary, commuter Young Scholars project in Science and              
              Mathematics for 60 students entering grades 10-12.                             
                                                                                             
              This project features hands-on scientific and mathematical                     
              research, including overnight field trips to science-related                   
              facilities and locations.  Real-world environmental and ecological             
              problems are studied and innovative teaching methods are used.                 
              Participants are provided a choice of study in the fields of                   
              microbiology and environmental science; chemistry, geology and                 
              physical science; or mathematics and computer science.  Students               
              receive college credit for their research activities.  Area high               
              school mathematics and science teachers assist college faculty                 
              during the summer and serve as contacts to insure the continuation             
              of activities and instructional methodologies in the high schools.
