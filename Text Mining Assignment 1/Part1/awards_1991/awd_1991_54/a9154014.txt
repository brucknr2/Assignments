Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                 Eclipse| is a one-hour program within the prime-time                       
              series NOVA, to be broadcast nationally during the 1991-92                     
              season on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).  The                          
              program will document the total eclipse of the sun that                        
              takes place on July 11, 1991, and the research performed at                    
              the observatories located atop Mauna Kea on the Big Island                     
              of Hawaii.  The program will trace three narrative lines.                      
              The first will be that of the eclipse itself and its                           
              importance for ongoing scientific investigation of the solar                   
              corona and solar physics.  The second will be that of                          
              ongoing problems in understanding the sun, especially the                      
              issue of solar variability.  The third will place this                         
              eclipse within the history of eclipse science.  The passage                    
              of an eclipse over a major observatory complex is a unique                     
              occurrence -- it has never happened before, and will not                       
              happen again for several generations.  The four minutes of                     
              totality will allow solar astronomers to turn deep space                       
              instruments on the sun for the first time.  At the same                        
              moment, however, this eclipse marks what many observers feel                   
              is the end of a 130 year research program.  Eclipse| will                      
              provide its audience with a portrait of a spectacular                          
              natural phenomenon and of scientists attempting in real-time                   
              to tease new knowledge out of the sun.  In addition to its                     
              broadcast, Eclipse| will be seen in an estimated 70-90,000                     
              classrooms over a seven year period.
