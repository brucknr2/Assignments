Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this project is to conduct a detailed study of             
              student classwork of twelfth grade students in several schools to              
              empirically validate statistical measures of the mathematics and               
              science curriculum.  This study will develop and use new techniques            
              for the measurement of actual practiced curriculum.  The techniques            
              are called "deep probe" because they involve detailed collections              
              of student classwork and discussions with teachers.  The results               
              should help other studies develop more appropriate methods of                  
              determining exactly what is taught in classrooms.//
