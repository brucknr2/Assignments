Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Southwest Texas State University will initiate a four-week,                    
              residential Young Scholars project in mathematics for 40 students              
              entering grades 11 and 12.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The project will excite young students about doing mathematics,                
              teach the students to think rigorously and precisely, and develop              
              inquisitive, questioning minds.  Students will learn elementary                
              number theory using a computer lab where they apply Mathematica to             
              discover new patterns and implement and compare algorithms.  They              
              will engage in problem solving in a mathematical setting linking               
              experiments with computers to real-life problems in physics,                   
              biology and economics.
