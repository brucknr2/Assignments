Abstract    :
                   The National Conference on Undergraduate Research is unique among         
              those designed to stimulate and reward undergraduate research in this          
              Nation's colleges and universities.  Now in their sixth year, these            
              national conferences attract more than 1,200 participants with as many         
              as 800 student presentations from the broad spectrum of academic               
              disciplines, but mainly in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering.         
              With funding provided by the National Science Foundation, future               
              conferences will be able to maintain their vitality with focus on              
              participation by underrepresented minority students and faculty through        
              competitive travel awards, providing keynote speakers who represent a          
              diversity of models for student participants, and stimulating faculty          
              to design and implement undergraduate research opportunities at their          
              home institutions.  In addition, the national conferences will develop         
              databases of faculty contacts for minority student recruitment and for         
              tracking minority students who have attended the National Conference           
              on Undergraduate Research.  Travel awards to as many as 35                     
              underrepresented minority students and faculty from predominantly              
              minority institutions will be provided.
