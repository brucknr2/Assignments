Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is part of the Minority Research Initiation Planning              
              Grant program.  A relatively junior minority scholar is supported              
              to advance her capacity to conduct research in the area of gender              
              as a factor in African-American adolescent's school performance.               
              The PI will consult with several leading scholars in this area of              
              research at the University of California, Berkeley, and at                     
              Princeton University, and will code and analyze data from an                   
              existing survey of adolescents at a high school in Washington DC.              
              The questions to be asked will help assess the relative                        
              importance of gender, race and class as factors explaining the                 
              differentials in school performance.                                           
                                                                                             
              This project is important because it supports a promising                      
              minority scholar in her field of study.  Through relatively small              
              investments in their future careers, the Foundation hopes to                   
              stimulate the research productivity of minority scholars.
