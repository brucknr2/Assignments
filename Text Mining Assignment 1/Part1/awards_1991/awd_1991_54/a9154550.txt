Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Indiana University, in cooperation with NSTA, will convene a                   
              Conference for Strategic Planning in Science Teacher Education                 
              in Washington, D.C. in January, 1992.  Three-member teams                      
              consisting of the Education Dean, Arts & Sciences Dean, and a                  
              Science Educator from twenty universities will be invited to                   
              participate.  The purpose of the conference is to discuss                      
              reform in precollege science curriculum and new directions                     
              needed in the preparation of teachers.  One of the outcomes of                 
              the conference will be the preparation of the report, "An                      
              Agenda for Action in Precollege Science Teacher Education                      
              Reform," which will be widely circulated among those preparing                 
              teachers.  It is also intended that the conference will                        
              stimulate the participants to examine teacher preparation at                   
              their respective institutions and take the lead in designing                   
              new innovative programs.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing is 38% of NSF's contributions.
