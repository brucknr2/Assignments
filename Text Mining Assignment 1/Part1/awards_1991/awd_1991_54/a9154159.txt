Abstract    :
              This project will involve undergraduate economics professors in                
              faculty development focusing on the new scholarship on the                     
              economics of women and minorities and assist them in                           
              developing, teaching and assessing methods of incorporating                    
              this scholarship into introductory economics courses.In August                 
              1992 planning begins for a 10 day faculty development seminar                  
              (scheduled for June 1993) which focuses on the new scholarship                 
              and its integration into introductory economics courses.  To                   
              accomplish these goals, seminar participants will be instructed                
              in recent developments in the scholarship on women and                         
              minorities by scholars contributing these developments; work in                
              teams to modify courses to incorporate the new scholarship;                    
              critique and refine these modifications; and develop techniques                
              to assess the impact of these changes on student outcome.
