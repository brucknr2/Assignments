Abstract    :
              Many institutions of higher learning that provide instruction in               
              astronomy do not possess modern, well-equipped facilities.                     
              Further, many introductory astronomy courses are taught by                     
              individuals whose professional training is in another field.  We               
              particularly seek such persons, frequently found at community                  
              colleges, for participation in a three-week workshop in which they             
              are exposed to:  (1) observing with astronomical telescopes; (2)               
              devices, including portable equipment, that can be used to                     
              stimulate student interest in the cosmos; (3) a variety of                     
              additional activities that illustrate the methods of astronomy and             
              that can be used to enhance undergraduate teaching programs.                   
              Participants reside on Tufts' residential campus in Medford,                   
              Massachusetts, and have access to the facilities of the Witin                  
              Observatory of Wellesley College, some 20 miles distant, for                   
              observing sessions.  A large portion of the remainder of the time              
              is devoted to involving participants in the types of "laboratory"              
              exercises they might use with their students.  Other activities                
              include a field trip to a nearby radio observatory; discussion of              
              classroom techniques, and discussions of current research in                   
              relevant fields.
