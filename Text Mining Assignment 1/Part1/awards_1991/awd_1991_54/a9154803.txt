Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The International Congresses of Mathematical Education are                     
              the most important forums for exchanges of scientific                          
              information among scholars in mathematics education.  The                      
              Seventh ICME will be held on August 17-23, 1992 in Quebec                      
              City, Quebec, Canada.  Given the current reform efforts in                     
              mathemaics education and the emerging and expanding dialogue                   
              among international scholars in mathematics education on                       
              curriculum, teacher education, and student expectations, it                    
              is essential that the United States be well represented by                     
              key mathematics educators and that information from the                        
              Congress be widely disseminated among the nation's                             
              mathematics educators and educational leaders.  The National                   
              Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), with the support                    
              of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), proposes                     
              to select 40 delegates to ICME-7and provide them with a                        
              participation award to subsidize their costs in attending.                     
              In return, each awardee will provide a written summary of                      
              Congress sessions they attended.  These reports, along with                    
              those of the Awards Committee and invited papers by selected                   
              individuals, will serve as the basis for a monograph on                        
              Congress Activities that will be published by                                  
              the NCTM.  Articles will be prepared by the Awards Committee                   
              for NCTM and MAA newsletters (circulation over 100,000).                       
              Presentations will also be made at regional and national                       
              meetings of both organizations.  Additionally, materials on                    
              the reform efforts in the United States will be shared with                    
              others at the Congress.
