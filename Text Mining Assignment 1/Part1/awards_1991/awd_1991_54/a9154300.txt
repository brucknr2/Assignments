Abstract    :
              A consortia of six institutions is conducting a series of six                  
              week long workshops over a three year period to enhance the                    
              expertise of mathematics faculty in the development and use of                 
              interactive computer experiments in differential equations.                    
              Consortia members are Cornell University, Harvey Mudd College,                 
              Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute, St. Olaf College, Washington                 
              State University, and West Valley College.  The computer                       
              projects are designed to be hardware/software independent and                  
              are intended to supplement standard courses in order to add                    
              another dimension to instruction in ordinary differential                      
              equations.  The primary goal of each workshop is to develop                    
              faculty expertise on a particular hardware/software platform so                
              that they can design and use interactive computer experiments                  
              in a laboratory environment.  A second goal is to develop an                   
              ongoing Consortium to promote the writing and evaluation of                    
              computer experiments in differential equations and its                         
              applications as well as in related areas of mathematics.
