Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CFA) will                     
              develop a modular, hands-on, discovery-based,                                  
              intercurricular, multicultural physical science program for                    
              elementary students using astronomy as the central focus.                      
              In the first three years of the project will develop, field                    
              test, and pilot four modules in 60 third and fourth grade                      
              classrooms.  At least half of the pilot classrooms will be                     
              in settings where underserved minorities comprise a major                      
              portion of the student population.  The modules will be the                    
              initial components of a complete program, which, when                          
              finished, may serve as a basic physical science curriculum                     
              or as a complement to an existing course.                                      
                                                                                             
              Teacher enhancement videotapes will also be developed by the                   
              CFA's Science Media Group, featuring exemplary classroom                       
              teaching along with scientific background to the activities.
