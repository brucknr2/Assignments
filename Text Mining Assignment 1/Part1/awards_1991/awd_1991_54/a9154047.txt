Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The University of Illinois will receive a planning grant                  
              for an evaluative study of the nine NSF Middle School Teacher                  
              Preparation Projects.  These five-year projects were funded in                 
              1986 as the result of a special program solicitation targeting                 
              the preparation of teachers of mathematics and science for the                 
              middle school level.  These projects have prepared a new                       
              generation of middle school teachers, have created courses and                 
              materials for middle school teacher preparation, and have                      
              greatly added to our knowledge base about the preparation of                   
              middle school mathematics and science teachers.  Therefore, it                 
              is important that these projects be carefully documented and                   
              evaluated, and the results be disseminated.  This planning                     
              grant will immediately begin to lay the groundwork for the                     
              evaluation activities while the projects are still active.
