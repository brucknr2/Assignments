Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Deficiency in reading comprehension has become a critical                      
              national problem; workplace illiteracy costs billions of                       
              dollars in corporate retraining, industrial accidents, and                     
              reduced competitiveness.  Although intelligent tutoring                        
              systems could help, their inability to see or hear students                    
              limits their effectiveness in diagnosing and remediating                       
              deficits in comprehension.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This pilot project will test the feasibility of addressing                     
              this fundamental limitation by using a novel                                   
              interdisciplinary approach made possible by recent advances                    
              in high-speed computing, automated speech processing,                          
              reading research, and artificial intelligence.  It will                        
              monitor children's oral reading of elementary science                          
              material, using automated recognition of connected speech                      
              and prosodic features (such as hesitation and intonation) to                   
              extract information identified by teachers and reading                         
              experts as pedagogically useful.  Success will lay the                         
              foundation for follow-on work to exploit this information in                   
              interactive instructional software.                                            
                                                                                             
              The significance of this work includes opening a powerful                      
              new channel between student and computer based on two-way                      
              speech communication, enabling innovative tutorial                             
              applications in technical areas where comprehension is                         
              vital.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Those affected include millions of children in grades 1-3,                     
              where oral reading is most important.  However, the results                    
              should apply to industrial training, adult illiteracy,                         
              English as a second language, and foreign language study.
