Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              As the number of children living in dual-earner families                       
              continues to increase, it becomes critical to understand the                   
              effects of parents work experience on children's development and               
              the processes through which such effects occur.  This research                 
              will finalize the methodology for a study of the impact of                     
              parents' occpuational experiences on family processes and                      
              children's well being among African-American families with                     
              preschool children.  Currently there are two limitations of the                
              work-family literature: (1) a failure to consider the ways in                  
              which the cultural context in which families operate may                       
              condition linkages between work and family life, and (2) a                     
              failure to elaborate the mechanisms through which parental                     
              employment impacts children.  This support will facilitate                     
              instrument development and identification of an adequate sampling              
              frame from which to select respondents.  Other scholars, and                   
              service providers who have expertise in these two areas will be                
              consulted.
