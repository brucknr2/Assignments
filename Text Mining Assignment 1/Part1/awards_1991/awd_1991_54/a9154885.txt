Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Wyoming will initiate a three-week, residential,             
              Young Scholars project in Engineering which will offer science                 
              enrichment activities for 30 precollege students entering grade 12.            
                                                                                             
              The program will emphasize research participation in materials                 
              science, control systems and computer-aided engineering.  Sessions             
              will apply fundamental mathematics, chemistry and physics concepts             
              to open-ended design problems.  Participants will be introduced to             
              developing technologies of composite materials and surface mount               
              technology as well as more established areas such as digital                   
              electronics and structural engineering.  Students will share their             
              research experiences with classmates during the academic year and              
              will experience continued involvement in engineering-related                   
              activities at the University through video teleconferencing.
