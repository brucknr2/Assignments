Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)                     
              will work with a national group of high school chemistry                       
              teachers to develop two modules - one on chemical bonding                      
              and the other on solvation - based on interactive scientific                   
              visualizations and animations under student control.  The                      
              students will use microcomputers in the classroom for                          
              visualization and will use a phone modem to access                             
              simulation software developed at NCSA, under separate                          
              funding, for research projects.  The goal of the project is                    
              to enhance the chemistry curriculum by enabling students to                    
              manipulate visual representations of abstract concepts and                     
              explore these concepts, thereby bringing the studying of                       
              chemistry closer to the doing of chemistry.  The modules                       
              will allow educators to explore and evaluate new pedagogical                   
              approaches to teaching and learning chemistry at the pre-                      
              college level, taking advantage of the dynamical, three-                       
              dimensional nature of the subject and of advances in                           
              technology.
