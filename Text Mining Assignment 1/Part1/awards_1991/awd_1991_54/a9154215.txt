Abstract    :
              A week-long workshop in modern techniques in the chemistry of                  
              binuclear organometallic compounds.  In addition to synthetic                  
              laboratory experience, the participants will rotate through                    
              their choice of four out of five technique-oriented laboratory                 
              sessions offered on: 1) multi-nuclear and 2-D nuclear magnetic                 
              resonance; 2) application of cyclic voltmetry; 3) infra-red                    
              spectroscopy; 4) molecular orbital calculations; 5) X-ray                      
              crystallography; and, 6) organometallic synthesis.    Date:
