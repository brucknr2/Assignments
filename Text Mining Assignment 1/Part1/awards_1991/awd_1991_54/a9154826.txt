Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Robert Boutilier is a professor of geology at                              
              Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts.  He has                            
              organized a three year effort, in collaboration with the                       
              Massachusetts Audubon Society, to help local school                            
              districts develop outdoor science education as an integral                     
              part of their elementary school science curriculum.                            
              Approximately 120 teachers will have two-week summer                           
              workshop experiences at one of several Audubon nature                          
              centers, where they will learn to develop instructional                        
              activities based on outdoor habitats close to their schools.                   
              Staff from the College and nature centers will work with                       
              these teachers during the academic year to help them refine                    
              their use of local environments for instructional purposes.                    
              The region covered by this project will include much of                        
              southeastern Massachusetts, extending from Boston through                      
              Brockton, New Bedford and Fall River to Cape Cod.                              
                                                                                             
              The proposed teacher enhancement project will establish an                     
              in-the-environment science curriculum for southeastern                         
              Massachusetts.  Teachers will receive training in the                          
              content and instructional methods necessary to help design                     
              and implement this new curriculum. More than 32 local school                   
              districts will benefit from this project.                                      
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing amounts to 33% of the NSF contribution to the                     
              project.
