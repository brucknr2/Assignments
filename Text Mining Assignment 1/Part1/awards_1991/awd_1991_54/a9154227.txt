Abstract    :
              A laboratory workshop based on recent Nobel experiments is                     
              being offered for undergraduate faculty from two-and four-year                 
              colleges throughout the nation.  Participants in this four-week                
              long, summer workshop carry out up to four experiments based on                
              seven recent Nobel prizes:  1987 Nobel Prize for High                          
              Temperature Superconductivity; 1986 Nobel Prize for the                        
              Scanning Tunneling Microscope; 1983 Nobel Prize for Nuclear                    
              Reactions and Nucleo-synthesis; the 1981 Nobel Prizes for                      
              Electron Spectroscopy, Non-Linear Optics, and Laser                            
              Spectroscopy; and the 1977 Nobel Prize for the Quantum Nature                  
              of Solids.  The "Nobel" Workshop offers participants "hands-on"                
              laboratory experience using up-to-date instrumentation                         
              purchased with a recent ILI Grant from NSF.  Participants                      
              interact daily with local and national experts in the various                  
              topic areas of Modern Physics, and work to develop                             
              instructional materials for teaching the physics concepts to                   
              science students.  Continued contact with the participants will                
              be maintained through a newsletter and electronic mail.  The                   
              intellectual stimulation and personal involvement experienced                  
              by the participants help them to relay the excitement of                       
              science to students at their home institutions.
