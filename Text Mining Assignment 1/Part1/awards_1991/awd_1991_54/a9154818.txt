Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This multi-year proposal has a comprehensive scope.  Its                       
              initial charge is to form a National Research Council (NRC),                   
              Coordinating Council for Education (CCE).  The CCE will                        
              consist of a seventeen member leadership group charged with                    
              mobilizing the human and intellectual resources of the                         
              National Academy of Sciences to accelerate pursuit of national                 
              educational goals.  The CCE would coordinate the several major                 
              educational efforts of the Academy, facilitating change in                     
              science and mathematics education from kindergarten through                    
              graduate education.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The CCE would extend the linking of the national networks in                   
              mathematics and science education already developed by the                     
              MSEB and the NSRC over the past five years.  four major                        
              national initiatives in K-16 science and mathematics education                 
              will be undertaken.  Other initiatives will be planned during                  
              this same period.  The identified initiatives are (1) the                      
              development of a national committee on K-12 science standards                  
              and assessment; (2) initiate improvement in undergraduate                      
              science and mathematics education; (3) building a national                     
              consensus among science and mathematics educators; (4) to                      
              monitor progress nationally and internationally; (5)                           
              networking teacher nationwide; (6) closing the                                 
              intramural/extramural technology gap; (7) undertake middle                     
              school mathematics and science reform projects; and (8)                        
              develop a national demonstration project.
