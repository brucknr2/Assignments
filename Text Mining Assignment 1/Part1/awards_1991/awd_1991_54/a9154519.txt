Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              CATALYST is a three year faculty development program at the                    
              University of Rhode Island (URI) for high school teachers of                   
              science, mathematics, and computer science.  It will:                          
                   1.  Train 96 high school science, mathematics, and                        
                       computer science teachers how to use interactive                      
                       technologies in the classroom.  This 1991-92                          
                       academic year component will stress hypermedia,                       
                       intelligent tutoring systems, repurposed videodisc,                   
                       microworlds, coaches, inspectable simulations,                        
                       computer animation, and automated data collection                     
                       and analysis.  The teachers will learn how to:                        
                       o  Teach students how to solve scientific problems                    
                          using the heuristic approach of Polya.                             
                       o  Manage CAI and video/digital audio projects                        
                          (including writing, producing, implementing, and                   
                          evaluating them).                                                  
                       o  Use the computer to write multimedia programs.                     
                       o  Deal with different learning styles of students.                   
                       o  Recognize science preconceptions and help                          
                          students to overcome them                                          
                       o  Evaluate software and interactive products.                        
                       o  Use information networks and database.                             
                       o  Creating instructional materials with commonly                     
                          available software and microcomputers,                             
                          workstations, and graphing calculators.                            
                                                                                             
              The teachers will finish the program's initial phases with                     
              projects they design and implement themselves.                                 
                   2.  Select 32 participants to develop an in-depth                         
                       project.  At least sixteen will attend URI for a                      
                       four week workshop during the summers of 1992 and                     
                       1993.  They will also work at the University for 10                   
                       to 20 percent of the work week during the 1991-92-                    
                       93, and 1993-94 academic year.                                        
                   3.  Evaluate how well the teacher-developed materials                     
                       works with students.                                                  
                   4.  Develop a series of probes and sensors along with                     
                       computer software tools to measure such phenomena                     
                       as heat, temperature, electromotive force, light                      
                       oscillations, and sound.  The teachers will use                       
                       these tools to produce a number of laboratory                         
                       experiments.                                                          
                                                                                             
              CATALYST relies on resources from several institutions.                        
              These include intelligent problem solving tutors and                           
              repurposed videodiscs  from URI, inspectable simulations                       
              from Appalachian State University, multimedia from the                         
              Department of Art at San Francisco State University, and                       
              microcomputers based laboratory experiments from Tufts                         
              University.  There is sharing of information and materials                     
              with a parallel project at the University of San Francisco.                    
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 186% of the NSF award.
