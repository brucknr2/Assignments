Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Chowan College will initiate a three-week, residential,                        
              multidisciplinary Young Scholars project offering science                      
              enrichment activities for 20 precollege students entering grade 10.            
                                                                                             
              In this program participants are exposed to a series of intense                
              hands-on laboratory activities in biology, chemistry, physics and              
              computer usage.  Students attend a lecture/laboratory for                      
              approximately three days in which they learn skills designed to be             
              used in carrying out research projects.  Three days are spent                  
              visiting industry and surrounding sights of ecological interest.               
              The remainder of the time is spent on their research project.                  
              Summaries are written in journal style and the findings presented              
              at a mock symposium.
