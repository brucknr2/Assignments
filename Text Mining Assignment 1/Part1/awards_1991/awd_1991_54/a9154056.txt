Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This award provides support for eight minority middle and high                 
              school teachers to work with eight principal investigators at                  
              Georgia Tech in the fields of Engineering, Computer Science,                   
              Astronomy, Physics, and Atmospheric Sciences.  The teachers                    
              will spend eight weeks during the summer of 1991 working on                    
              NSF-funded research projects.  This activity is funded in                      
              response to the Research Opportunity Awards description in the                 
              most recent NSF Guide to Programs.
