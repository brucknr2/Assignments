Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The excitement of astrophysical research and discovery is                      
              brought into the high school science and mathematics classes                   
              through a flexible set of student activities and projects on                   
              variable stars.  The project includes a computerized                           
              database, of 400,000 measurements of brightness of 150                         
              variable stars in five constellations over 25 years, from                      
              which students can deduce properties, processes, and                           
              evolution of these stars.  Students can make additional                        
              measurements and discoveries from carefully selected time                      
              sequences of 125 35mm slides or from actual measurements                       
              from the night sky.  A comprehensive student manual and                        
              instructional videos make the materials self-contained and                     
              easy to use.  The teacher manual enables the instructor to                     
              adapt the materials to skills, objectives and local                            
              curricula.  The material can be used in a variety of                           
              contexts:  traditional mathematics and science classes at                      
              both the high school and college level, independent                            
              projects, summer institutes, and community science clubs.                      
              The material will be field tested in classes and refined                       
              through workshops with teachers.  A newsletter and a video                     
              about amateur astronomers is planned.
