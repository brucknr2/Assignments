Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A seventh grade multimedia science curriculum, using a                         
              constructivist pedagogy, a thematic approach and a                             
              multidisciplinary organization of science has already been                     
              developed by the proposers under other funding.  In this                       
              project compatible sixth and eighth grade curricula will                       
              develop which integrate material from earth science, life                      
              science and physical science, using four different themes at                   
              each grade level.  The large ideas of science and science as                   
              a method of knowing are stressed.  Each unit includes                          
              teacher lessons; student activities and bibliographic                          
              resources stored in software; a learning resource management                   
              tool, compatible with either IBM or MacIntosh computers,                       
              which allows teachers to choose, write and edit lessons,                       
              assign student activities, access videodiscs and review                        
              supplemental material; four videodiscs; eight hands-on                         
              activities; and pre- and in-service teacher models.                            
              Evaluation and teacher enhancement will be done in                             
              cooperation with nearby universities.
