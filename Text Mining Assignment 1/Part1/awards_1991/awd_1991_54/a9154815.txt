Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Community of Explorers project will develop and study                      
              the growth of a new kind of wide-area computer network for                     
              high school biology and physics instruction.  The network                      
              will support a distributed community of teachers, students                     
              and scientists who will share ideas for classroom                              
              investigators and instructional activities in physics and                      
              biology.  They will also share concrete exemplars of how                       
              these topics can be investigated using Explorer, a modeling                    
              and simulation program.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Our experiment in building a community of explorers will                       
              focus on a communications technology that will make it                         
              straightforward to send and receive Explorer laboratories                      
              that convey all the parameters and data of a simulation                        
              experiment in progress along with an optional text                             
              annotation.  We have two related hypotheses.  The first is                     
              that a distributed community in which teachers can exchange                    
              the actual "live" experiments and data from their classes                      
              will be more robust and educationally productive than a                        
              network over which teachers can exchange only text, or which                   
              is designed primarily as a delivery system.  Second, that                      
              teachers will use Explorer more effectively and will take                      
              advantage of its extensibility to a greater extent with the                    
              support of a networked community than those who use Explorer                   
              locally in their schools without networking facilities for                     
              communication with others in the Explorer user community.
