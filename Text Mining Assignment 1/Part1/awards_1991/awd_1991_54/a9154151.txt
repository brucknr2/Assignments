Abstract    :
              This project establishes a regional coalition of two-year                      
              colleges for the purpose of faculty enhancement in physics and                 
              physical science teaching.Twenty teachers from two-year                        
              colleges in this region are studying computational physics,                    
              classroom methods, and communication during a one-week workshop                
              at Henderson State University.  The materials used in the                      
              workshop were developed by the project director with partial                   
              support from the National Science Foundation.  These materials                 
              have been the subject of two textbooks published by major                      
              publishing companies.Following the initial workshop,                           
              participants complete individual investigations in                             
              computational physics and report the results of these                          
              activities during a two-day follow-up session.  Participants                   
              gain both useful teaching methods and an opportunity to remain                 
              intellectually vigorous within their discipline.
