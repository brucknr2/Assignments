Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks funds ($41,724) got activity, including                    
              research, that builds upon AAAS' This Year In School Science                   
              and Assessing Higher Order Thinking In Mathematics.  The                       
              research involves the collection of data supplied by the 50                    
              State Education Officers regarding the status of each state                    
              in the evolving "assessment of student learning vis-a-vis                      
              science and mathematics.  This data, and other data                            
              collected prior to a planned conference on this topic will                     
              serve to frame the discussion.  The outcome will lead to                       
              plans to share costs across states as the states continue to                   
              unfold activity in the assessment area.                                        
                                                                                             
              (This project should be of great assistance to the states                      
              and to AAAS.  I recommend funding this effort.
