Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This inservice program involves a partnership among                            
              planetary scientists, science educators, and teachers at the                   
              elementary and middle school level.  It is designed to : (a)                   
              provide education in astronomy and basic scientific                            
              principles for teachers and (b) provide teachers with the                      
              means to communicate these concepts in an inquiry fashion to                   
              students.  Since topics in space science are part of the                       
              elementary school curriculum from Kindergarten through                         
              eighth grade, providing teachers with knowledge of both                        
              concepts and teaching methods will enable them to provide                      
              hands-on experiences that will enhance the critical thinking                   
              skills of their students.  The program will involve teachers                   
              in four week long leadership workshops, follow up classes                      
              during the year, and close working relationships with                          
              scientists.  Included in the project will be the development                   
              of resource materials for teachers to share as they conduct                    
              two-day workshops for other elementary school teachers.                        
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing of the project will be at least twelve                        
              percent of the project.  If the project is enhanced by a                       
              grant from NASA the total cost sharing will become 53% of                      
              the project.
