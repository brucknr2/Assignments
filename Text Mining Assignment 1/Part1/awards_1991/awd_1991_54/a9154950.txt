Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Texas A.& M. University Engineering Experiment Station will                
              initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars project in                   
              Engineering which will provide science enrichment activities for 32            
              precollege students entering grades 8 and 9.                                   
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize research participation in 13                
              different engineering fields.  The research experience for each                
              Young Scholar will consist of assignment to an undergraduate                   
              research project that has been started but not yet completed.  Each            
              project involves data collection, analysis, theoretical results and            
              a write-up of experimental procedures.
