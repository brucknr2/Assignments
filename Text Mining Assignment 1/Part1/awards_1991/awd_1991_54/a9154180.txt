Abstract    :
              The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) is conducting a                    
              three-year program for improving undergraduate science                         
              education that will create a number of regionally- based                       
              science education teams across the country.   Undergraduate                    
              faculty from both two- and four-year colleges will participate                 
              in a summer enrichment experience in the institutions and                      
              laboratories of ASM research scientists, and interact with                     
              eminent scientists through participation in the Society's                      
              General Meeting activities and throughout the academic                         
              year.
