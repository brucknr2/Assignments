Abstract    :
              The Great Lakes Research Consortium (GLRC) proposes to immerse                 
              20 undergraduate faculty in a 3-week summer practicum that                     
              demonstrates environmental problem-solving as an effective                     
              teaching strategy to stimulate undergraduates' interest in                     
              environmental science.  Participating faculty will learn                       
              environmental analysis techniques and prepare environmental                    
              impact statements for a hypothetical development project in a                  
              contaminated harbor of Lake Ontario.  As they are being exposed                
              to new theoretical concepts and techniques developed by the                    
              Great Lakes Research community to understand and solve                         
              environmental problems.  Participants will be shown how to                     
              integrate environmental problem-solving into curricula at their                
              home institutions.  Through preparation of environmental impact                
              statements for a realistic project, these techniques will be                   
              integrated into the overall environmental analysis and problem                 
              solving approach that has stimulated undergraduate interest in                 
              science at two GLRC campuses for a decade.  Participants in the                
              practicum will return to their home institutions with expanded                 
              and updated professional skills and new strategies and                         
              techniques for improving undergraduate education, and                          
              addressing environmental problems in local communities.
