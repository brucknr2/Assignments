Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              VideoGraph is an instructional tool created for use in                         
              introductory physics laboratories at the high school and                       
              college levels.  It allows students to videotape motion                        
              events, and using the graphing capabilities of a                               
              microcomputer, to simultaneously examine and analyze the                       
              motion.  In this revision of the initial software package,                     
              which received the Ohaus Award in 1989, the developers are                     
              enhancing the original capabilities of the program,                            
              including high quality color images and support for access                     
              to videodiscs.  In addition, it will allow students to save                    
              previously recorded events, whether recorded on videotape or                   
              played from a videodisc, and "draw" events using paint                         
              applications or programming language.  In this way, students                   
              will be able to analyze previously recorded events or even                     
              simulated microworlds in which the laws of motion are                          
              preprogrammed into the system.  In addition to developing                      
              the software, this project will conduct classroom studies to                   
              facilitate its integration into traditional classroom,                         
              laboratory, and homework activities.  It is also refining a                    
              previously developed test of student skills in motion graph                    
              interpretation, and plans to develop observational schemes                     
              and alternative assessment methods to verify that the                          
              materials are having an impact on student understanding.
