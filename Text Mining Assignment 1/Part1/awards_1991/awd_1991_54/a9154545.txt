Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The Education Development Center in collaboration with the                     
              Prince George's County Public School District seeks support                    
              for a 3-day planning conference with follow-up activities that                 
              will span the 1991-1992 school year.  The conference and                       
              follow-up activities are designed to support the district's                    
              efforts to improve the quality of elementary science and                       
              mathematics education programs in the county by coordinating                   
              and conducting training and technical assistance activities                    
              for district elementary education personnel.  The conference                   
              grows out of a recently initiated partnership agreement                        
              between the County and NSF in which NSF pledged its support of                 
              county efforts to strengthen precollege educational                            
              activities.  The focus of the conference is the application of                 
              national and state science and mathematics performance                         
              standards in the elementary classroom.
