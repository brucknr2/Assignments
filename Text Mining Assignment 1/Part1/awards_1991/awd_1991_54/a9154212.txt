Abstract    :
              This three-week short course extends the knowledge of teachers                 
              of undergraduate computer science in programming paradigms,                    
              from both a theoretical and hands-on perspective.  The course                  
              contrasts the functional, object-oriented, and logic paradigms                 
              with the more familiar procedural.  This material is essential                 
              to a well-rounded computer science program, and is not easily                  
              learned independently. The course is of particular value to                    
              small college computer science faculty who are challenged by                   
              the rapid change in the field.  The schedule includes study                    
              prior to the course, intensive in-residence study, and                         
              supervised project work.  Participants are encouraged to                       
              continue collaborative work after the program.
