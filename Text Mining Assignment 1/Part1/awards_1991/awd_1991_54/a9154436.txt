Abstract    :
                   The National Science Center Foundation (NSCF) is a nonprofit              
              organization whose goal is to improve performance of U.S. students             
              in mathematics and science by creating new technological tools for             
              teaching those subjects and implementing them in our schools.                  
                   The NSCF's initial objective is to develop a computer-based               
              teaching system, including courseware, to improve the teaching and             
              learning of secondary school mathematics from algebra I through                
              calculus.                                                                      
                   Design of a unique teaching system called Learning Logic (L2)             
              began in October 1988, functional specifications were finalized in             
              June 1989, and basic L2 system operating software and 15 algebra I             
              courseware topics were completed and alpha tested in June 1990.                
              Development to that juncture was funded by the private sector and              
              a state of Georgia grant.                                                      
                   National Science Foundation funding over three years will be              
              used to complete and test operating system software and courseware             
              for algebra I, algebra II, trigonometry, and calculus, to complete             
              courseware design for geometry, to produce a courseware authoring              
              system, and to deploy L2 nationally.  A timeline includes the beta             
              test of fully enhanced operating software and algebra I alpha test             
              by seven Georgia high schools during 1990-91; the algebra I and II             
              courseware beta test in 100 schools in 1991-1992; completion of an             
              authoring system, completion through testing of all mathematics                
              courseware except geometry, and enlisting 500 schools in 1992-93.              
                   The overall goal of the project is to orient school personnel             
              and students to a prototype program for urban school improvement               
              with emphasis on developing competence in science and mathematics.//
