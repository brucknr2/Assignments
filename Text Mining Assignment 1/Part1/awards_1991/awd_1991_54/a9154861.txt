Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Loyola University of Chicago will initiate a six-week,                     
              commuter, multidisciplinary Young Scholars project which will offer            
              science enrichment activities for 18 precollege students entering              
              grades 11 and 12.                                                              
                                                                                             
              This program will emphasize research participation in computer                 
              science, mathematics and physics.  The interdisciplinary activities            
              begin with participant introduction to basic computer architecture,            
              after which they assemble IBM-compatible microcomputers.  Each week            
              the students engage in labs in digital electronics, engineering and            
              computer architecture under the direction of a research physicist.             
              Career-oriented field trips to A.T.& T. Laboratories, Motorola,                
              Rockwell International and General Motors are included.                        
              Participants retain the computers for use during the eight-month               
              follow-up which consists of three Saturday morning classes each                
              month.
