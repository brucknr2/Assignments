Abstract    :
              This project provides college faculty with the expertise                       
              necessary to introduce modern methods of recombinant DNA and                   
              protein analysis into their undergraduate programs.  An                        
              intensive six-week practicum is at the core of the project, in                 
              which 20 participants will master the fundamental techniques.                  
              Recognizing that college faculty must operate within financial                 
              and time constraints in presenting undergraduate courses, low-                 
              cost and time-efficient experimental modes appropriate to the                  
              teaching setting will be investigated.  Date: Summer
