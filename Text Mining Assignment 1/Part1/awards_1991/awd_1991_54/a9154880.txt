Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Mississippi will initiate a three-week,                      
              residential Young Scholars project in the Life Sciences which will             
              offer science enrichment activities for 40 precollege students                 
              entering grades 10-12.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This program will emphasize research participation in wetlands in              
              fresh water ecology.  A biological field station will serve as an              
              outdoor laboratory for research on amphibian and reptile migration.            
              Participants will build a drift fence, address hypotheses                      
              concerning migration, and learn the behavior and ecology of many               
              species.  Field trips to the National Forest Hydrology Laboratory,             
              the National Sedimentation Laboratory, and the Sardis Reservoir Dam            
              will supplement their coursework.
