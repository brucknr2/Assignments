Abstract    :
              This project is for the 6th National Conference of Black Physics               
              Students (NCBPS) at Stanford University in February, 1992.  The                
              purpose of the conference is to assist and encourage those black               
              students who have already shown interest and ability in physics to             
              enter and complete Ph.D. Programs, and to initiate research careers            
              in Physics.  The primary audience for the conference are                       
              undergraduate students who are majoring in physics, or who have                
              expressed an interest in physics; a principal goal of the                      
              conference is to permit these students, who are in the process of              
              making career decisions that will shape the course of their working            
              lives, to meet and interact with black graduate students, and                  
              senior black scientists who can serve as role models and mentors.
