Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The MAA, through its project SUMMA (Strengthening                              
              Underrepresented Minority Mathematics Achievement) proposes                    
              the development of a national consortium of mathematics-based                  
              intervention projects aimed at strengthening the existing 50+                  
              projects and increasing the number of projects by at least 10                  
              each year.  The Consortium will provide networking                             
              opportunities for mathematicians, mathematics teachers, and                    
              mathematics educators, building on the structure of the 33,000                 
              member MAA.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Activities include workshops to be held at regional section                    
              meetings, the training of undergraduate students as                            
              counselors, and dissemination of information through                           
              presentations at national meetings and a newsletter.  In                       
              addition, a handbook on how to start and conduct an                            
              intervention project and a directory of existing projects are                  
              to be produced and widely distributed.                                         
                                                                                             
              By the third year of the project the Consortium is expected to                 
              include 90 or more projects and 7,000 newly recruited minority                 
              students with their teachers as participants.  The long range                  
              goal is to increase the number of minority students reached by                 
              mathematics-based intervention projects in the year 2000 to                    
              more than 15,000.
