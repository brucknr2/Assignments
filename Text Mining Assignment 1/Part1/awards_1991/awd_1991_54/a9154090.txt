Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is initiating an attempt at a major reform in the                 
              content and methodology of teaching geometry in American high                  
              schools.  The intent is to give average students a richer                      
              understanding of geometric facts and methodologies, mathematical               
              concepts at the heart of geometry, visual thinking, and the way                
              that applications of geometry affect their lives.                              
                                                                                             
              Author teams consisting of a content geometer and a high school                
              teacher will develop 20 modules from which alternative curricula               
              can be constructed.  This design is to permit teachers                         
              flexibility in testing and implementing the modules.  These                    
              varied experiences will inform the development of a high school                
              geometry textbook.  Four or five 12-15 minute video segments                   
              featuring applications of selected module topics will also be                  
              produced.  A GEOMAP Inservice Leaders' Handbook will be prepared               
              to facilitate use of the modules in teacher enhancement                        
              programs.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Initial project materials will be peer-reviewed by reviewers                   
              recruited through calls in consortium.  Revised materials will                 
              then be extensively field-tested across the country.  Final                    
              products will be disseminated nationally through COMAP and a                   
              commercial publisher.
