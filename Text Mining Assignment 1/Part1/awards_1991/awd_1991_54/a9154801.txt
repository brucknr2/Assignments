Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This renewal project will involve 30 elementary and middle                     
              school teachers in a 2-year program which focuses on                           
              experiences with chemistry at a level appropriate to teachers                  
              who have had little or no background in chemistry.  Teachers                   
              will participate in two intensive 3-week summer workshops in                   
              chemistry and science methods, and will receive on-site                        
              support from project personnel during the subsequent academic                  
              years.  Teachers will also participate in a 3-day session on                   
              leadership and the presentation of inservices to be held                       
              during February of the first year.  Project staff will                         
              provide on-site support as participants incorporate what                       
              they've learned into their science classes, and as they                        
              present inservices to their colleagues.  During the course of                  
              the project, project staff and participants will collaborate                   
              on the revision and enhancement of Chemistry for Children, an                  
              activity book of chemistry activities designed for elementary                  
              and middle school children.                                                    
                                                                                             
              This leadership project is appropriate for the Teacher                         
              Enhancement Program because of its extensive enhancement of                    
              the science education of elementary and middle school                          
              teachers and because of its plan for participants to provide                   
              science inservice for all of the teachers in their respective                  
              schools.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 15% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
