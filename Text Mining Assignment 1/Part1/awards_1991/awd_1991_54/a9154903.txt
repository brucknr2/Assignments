Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Montana State University will initiate a three-week, residential               
              Young Scholars project in the Life Sciences which will offer                   
              science enrichment activities for 30 precollege students entering              
              grades 10,11.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This program will emphasize field research in aquatic ecology.  The            
              project site, located on Canyon Ferry Lake, is a Bureau of                     
              Reclamation former housing facility which has been converted to                
              science laboratories and dormitories.  Participants will learn to              
              use state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation while working side-            
              by-side with biologists, chemists, earth scientists, engineers and             
              corporate officers in an integrated scientific study of the upper              
              Missouri River and some of its tributaries.
