Abstract    :
              This project introduces undergraduate computer science faculty                 
              to parallel computing.  When they have completed the project                   
              they will not only be prepared to develop an undergraduate                     
              course on parallel computing, but also to assess the                           
              feasibility of establishing an undergraduate parallel                          
              processing laboratory at their own college and the                             
              possibilities for incorporating aspects of parallel computing                  
              into other courses.  The project begins with an intensive two-                 
              week course in the summer of 1992.  The course includes                        
              lectures surveying the broad scope of parallel computing and                   
              instruction on the design and implementation of parallel                       
              algorithms.  About half the time during this course is spent                   
              doing hands-on programming.  There is a parallel development                   
              work station for every participant and four parallel computers                 
              (three with sixteen processors, one with eight processors) for                 
              running and bench marking the programs.  During the Fall, the                  
              twenty participants work on larger projects, with site visits                  
              from the instructors and/or visits back to Colgate.  In January                
              1993 there is a one-week seminar where participants present                    
              their projects and discuss the practical aspects of teaching                   
              parallel programming to undergraduates.//
