Abstract    :
              The ATLAST Project will sponsor a series of ten regional                       
              workshops during the summers of 1992 and 1993 on the use of                    
              software in teaching linear algebra.  Workshop participants                    
              will learn how to use existing commercial linear algebra                       
              software packages and how to effectively incorporate these                     
              packages into their courses. Participants will also be expected                
              to design their own computing exercises and projects at a level                
              suitable for assignment in an undergraduate linear algebra                     
              class.  These exercises will be class tested during the school                 
              year following the workshop, revised if necessary, and then                    
              submitted to the project director for inclusion in a database.                 
              The databases from each of the summer workshops will be edited,                
              printed as manuals, and distributed to the workshop                            
              participants. The project director will select the best                        
              exercises from the manuals for inclusion in a special ATLAST                   
              Project book which will be published by one of the mathematics                 
              societies.
