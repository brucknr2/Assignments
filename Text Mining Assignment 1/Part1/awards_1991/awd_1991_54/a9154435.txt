Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is designed to provide a mechanism for the                        
              National Governors Association to work with Governors and                      
              other state policy makers and assist them in becoming                          
              advocates for mathematics and science education reform                         
              through systemic strategies. A conference joined to meetings                   
              of the Education Commission of the States will bring                           
              together the key players from the states to present and                        
              discuss the issues at hand. A number of follow-up activities                   
              will enhance the efforts made at the conference by                             
              networking the participants in a nationwide effort to                          
              incorporate systemic strategies into education reform.
