Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is designed to establish a Science Institute                     
              for elementary teachers at the University of California,                       
              Davis, and is based on a similar NSF-funded project at U.C.                    
              San Diego.  The Institute will invite 75 elementary school                     
              teachers identified as leaders to participate in a program                     
              spanning a three-year period, beginning in July, 1993.                         
              Teams of 2-3 teachers from each participating school will                      
              participate each year in a 4-wk summer Institute followed by                   
              monthly Saturday seminars (8) during the academic year.                        
              During the summer institutes, participants will attend                         
              lectures and labs on biological science (Yr 1), earth and                      
              space science (Yr 2), and physical science (Yr 3); during                      
              the Saturday sessions of the academic year, teachers will                      
              work on integration of these disciplines into themes                           
              suggested by the California Science Framework.  Outstanding                    
              UCD scientist-educators will emphasize major concepts and                      
              principles in an interactive setting that utilizes                             
              demonstrations and small and large group discussion, and                       
              master teachers and science educators will work with                           
              participants in adapting exemplary curricular materials to                     
              correlate with the California Model Curriculum Guide and the                   
              California Science Framework.  Districts will be expected to                   
              provide support in the form of release time, space and                         
              materials.  Participants will be expected to act as                            
              resources to their schools and districts and to provide                        
              inservice workshops for other classroom teachers, reaching                     
              at least 2325 teachers in all.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because it will greatly enhance the science                            
              knowledge and teaching of lead teachers, and is designed to                    
              reach a large number of their colleagues as well.                              
                                                                                             
              The cost-sharing amount is approximately 16% of the amount                     
              requested from NSF.
