Abstract    :
              In the summer of 1990 a "Transforming Physics Content Using New                
              Technologies" workshop was held at the United States Air Force                 
              Academy in Colorado Springs.  The response from the physics                    
              community at large and the selected participants in particular                 
              was enthusiastic.  There is a real interest and need within the                
              physics community for information on and experience with using                 
              the new interactive technologies in physics teaching.  Based on                
              the lessons the we learned from the 1990 workshop and from the                 
              comments of the participants we are conducting a new workshop                  
              on using the new interactive technologies to teach physics.                    
              The goals of the new workshop are much the same as the first:                  
              to enable physicists to use the new interactive technologies to                
              teach physics, to foster discussions and formulations of new                   
              teaching strategies using these technologies, and to                           
              disseminate the information learned beyond the workshop                        
              confines to the physics community at large.
