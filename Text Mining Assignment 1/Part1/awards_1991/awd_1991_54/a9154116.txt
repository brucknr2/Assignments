Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In 1983 the President inaugurated the National Partnerships in                 
              Education program and requested that each federal agency                       
              establish a partnership with a local school.  NSF formed a                     
              partnership with Banneker High School which has a special                      
              emphasis in science and mathematics.  The Foundation has                       
              initiated a variety of activities with the school centering on                 
              staff and outside speaker presentations and trips to science                   
              facilities.  This year the staff in the Directorate for Education              
              and Human Resources assisted Banneker faculty and staff in the                 
              identification of "critical needs" in the school's science and                 
              mathematics programs.  As a result the school is being awarded a               
              grant of $63,000 to upgrade science laboratory equipment,                      
              purchase materials and supplies and implement staff development                
              activities.
