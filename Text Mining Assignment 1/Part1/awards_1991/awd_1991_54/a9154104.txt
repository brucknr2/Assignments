Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This  four-year project will develop a program for                             
              kindergarten through sixth grades that fosters the                             
              development of number sense concepts through a problem-                        
              solving approach.l  The program will provide conceptual                        
              edperiences to promote students' understanding of number,                      
              quantity, and operations.  It will model new teaching                          
              strategies and content for elementary mathematic                               
              instruction.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The projecat will develo;p, pilot, and evaluate three units                    
              per grade level.  Each unit will be two tothree weeks long                     
              and have a dual focus:  to deepen students' understanding of                   
              mathematical concepts and to develop their interpersonal                       
              skills and commitment to values of caring, fairness, and                       
              responsibility.  The units will provide opportunities for                      
              students to explore number concepts as they cooperatively                      
              investigate problems and communicate about their thinking                      
              and learning.  The units will be devel;oped through a                          
              process that includes repeated trials in classrooms by                         
              teachers and CMP staff.  The units will be published by                        
              Addison-Wesley.                                                                
                                                                                             
              An evaluation will assess:  (1) how teachers use the                           
              materials in their classrooms; (2) how participation in a                      
              staff development program influences teacher implementation;                   
              and (3) the impact of the program on student concept                           
              attainment and teachers' and students' attitudes about                         
              mathematics.
