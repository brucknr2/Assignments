Abstract    :
                   This is an international study that will collect sample survey            
              data on student achievement in the use of computers by elementary              
              and secondary school students in the United States.  It is the                 
              second phase of the Computers in Education Study designed by the               
              International Association for the Evaluation of Educational                    
              Achievement (IEA).  The study's purpose is to provide comparisons              
              between countries in level of study knowledge and use of word                  
              processing, spreadsheets, and general purposes of personal                     
              computers.  It will also provide time trend information about the              
              uses of computers in schools; their function and integration with              
              the traditional curriculum.//
