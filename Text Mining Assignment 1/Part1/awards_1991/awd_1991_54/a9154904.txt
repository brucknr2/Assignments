Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Iowa State University will initiate a four-week, residential               
              Young Scholars project in Molecular Biology which will offer                   
              science enrichment activities for 20 precollege students entering              
              grades 8 and 9.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This program will emphasize both content instruction and science               
              practice through laboratory experimentation utilizing research                 
              techniques and equipment.  Topics will include chemistry,                      
              biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology, and biotechnology.               
              Career exploration will be emphasized through interactions with                
              scientists, visits to industrial laboratories and career planning              
              exercises.
