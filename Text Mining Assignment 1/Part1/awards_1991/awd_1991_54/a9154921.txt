Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              North Carolina State University @ Raleigh will initiate a four-                
              week, residential Young Scholars project in Physics and Engineering            
              which will offer science enrichment activities for 28 precollege               
              students entering grade 12.                                                    
                                                                                             
              This summer program is an evolution of a similar program that has              
              been presented successfully at the University since 1982.  Students            
              participate in four weeks of lecture, laboratories and research at             
              NCSU working under the close supervision of experienced nuclear                
              engineering faculty.  Participants acquire an understanding of                 
              nuclear engineering fundamentals and engage in a research                      
              experience that requires them to collect data, make measurements               
              and interpret the results.
