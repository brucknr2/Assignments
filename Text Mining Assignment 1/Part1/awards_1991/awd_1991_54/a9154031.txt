Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An important source of human capital is the intellectually                     
              able but physically disabled student.  Since teachers                          
              typically are not prepared to know how to deal with this type                  
              of student in the science classroom and to cultivate the                       
              student's full potential, teachers usually discourage disabled                 
              students from pursuing continued study in science.  In order                   
              to address this problem, The American Institutes for Research                  
              will develop, test, and disseminate instructional modules to                   
              prepare science teachers to deal with specially challenged                     
              students in the science classroom and to understand how to                     
              encourage these students to reach their full potential in                      
              science.  Specific barriers unique to the study of science                     
              will be considered and strategies for overcoming these                         
              barriers will be discussed in the modules.  The writing team                   
              will include teachers with experience in teaching science to                   
              specially challenged students, and the modules will be                         
              reviewed by a distinguished panel consisting of disabled                       
              scientists and experts in the area of meeting the needs of                     
              disabled science students.  The modules will be field tested                   
              and disseminated through four regional sites throughout the                    
              country.  It is envisioned that these materials will be useful                 
              to both preservice and inservice teachers in enhancing their                   
              attitudes and effectiveness in working with specially                          
              challenged students in the science classroom.
