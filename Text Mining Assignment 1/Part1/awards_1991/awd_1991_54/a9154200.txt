Abstract    :
              This project will focus on a three-week workshop in the biology                
              and ecology of corals and coral reefs for undergraduate faculty                
              in the biological sciences.  The workshop will provide                         
              experiences in concepts and investigative methods(spectroscopy,                
              calorimetry,elctrophoresis) that will enhance the backgrounds                  
              of these faculty as well as their approaches to undergraduate                  
              instruction in the biological sciences.
