Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Colorado College will initiate a three-week, residential Young             
              Scholars project in Mathematics which will offer enrichment                    
              activities for 22 precollege students entering grade 12.                       
                                                                                             
              Participants will study and solve for themselves three of the                  
              classical "great problems" of mathematics using original sources --            
              Area and the Definite Integral, Solution of Algebraic Equations,               
              and Fermat's Last Theorem.  Daily colloquia will include                       
              discussions of the history, philosophy and ethics of mathematics as            
              well as presentations by mathematicians and computer scientists                
              from local research facilities.
