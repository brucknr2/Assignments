Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Texas @ San Antonio will initiate an eight-week,             
              commuter Young Scholars project in Mathematics which will offer                
              enrichment activities for 2,400 precollege students entering grades            
              7-12.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The first-year component will include Logic and Its Application to             
              Mathematics, Problem Solving, Engineering, and Computer Science.               
              The second-year component will include Algebraic Structures,                   
              Problem Solving, and Physics.  The third-year component will                   
              include Probability and Statistics, Problem Solving, and Technical             
              Writing.  Scholars are divided into groups of 20, determined mainly            
              by school grade level.  Each group follows its own class and                   
              laboratory schedule.
