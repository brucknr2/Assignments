Abstract    :
              This project focusses on modeling (constructing mathematical                   
              and computer models to gain understanding of phenomena) as the                 
              subject matter with the use of cooperative learning groups to                  
              enhance the efforts of students.  Participants in the workshop                 
              will be prepared to include a module on modeling in present                    
              science/math courses and/or to develop a course on modeling for                
              their program. The one-week summer training will give                          
              instructors a background and practice in modeling and working                  
              in cooperative relationships, take them through the module they                
              would use as a guide for their teaching, have them develop more                
              specific examples and lessons for translating the module into                  
              their setting, and build networking within and across teams                    
              and across teams.  Follow-up will include electronic bulletin                  
              board exchange of information, a newsletter from the Center and                
              visits from project staff to provide feedback and assistance.
