Abstract    :
                   The project will present a mini-course on the elements of                 
              a successful scientific conference.  Particular attention will                 
              be given to behind the scenes operations, logistics,                           
              arrangements, and publicity.  Participants will get hands-on                   
              experiences in conferencing.                                                   
                   NSF program officers will discuss particular NSF programs.                
              Programs aimed at minority institutions and programs designed                  
              to increase minority participation in the scientific community                 
              will be emphasized.  An objective of this project is to                        
              increase the number of minorities submitting proposals to NSF.
