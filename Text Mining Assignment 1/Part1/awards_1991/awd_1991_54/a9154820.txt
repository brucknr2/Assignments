Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests partial funding for the development                     
              of a new paleobiology hall at the University of Nebraska                       
              State Museum.  This project will give students and the                         
              general public a dynamic view of the period of time known as                   
              the Age of Reptiles.  It emphasizes experience with                            
              interactive exhibits that focus on concepts of geologic                        
              time, how species adapt and change, relative size, scale and                   
              time, the activities of scientists as role models, and it                      
              provides reinforcement of these experiences for students in                    
              the classroom.  This project includes the first use in a                       
              museum of SemNet, a software program designed for concept                      
              mapping and the representation of knowledge networks, which                    
              will be used with a videodisc.  Prototypes of all                              
              interactive exhibits will undergo formative evaluation to                      
              establish maximal audience accessibility, ease of use and                      
              educational effectiveness.  The exhibit concepts will be                       
              disseminated throughout the state of Nebraska through mini-                    
              versions, teachers in-service training, and scientist-in-                      
              residence programs.  This project will also be used as a                       
              teaching laboratory for the University of Nebraska's                           
              graduate program in Museum Studies.
