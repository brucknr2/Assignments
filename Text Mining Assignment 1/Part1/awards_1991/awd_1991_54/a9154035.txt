Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is designed to develop and evaluate a                             
              sustainable university/school/industry program that models                     
              new methodologies for preparing elementary teachers to teach                   
              science effectively in a multicultural/urban setting. Over                     
              six semesters, 150 Towson State University (TSU) elementary                    
              education majors will be trained to teach, and subsequently                    
              teach, hands-on, integrated, sequential science units to                       
              small groups of children in grades 1-5.  The field component                   
              is to be located in 2 Baltimore City Public Schools (BCPS)                     
              having 90+% minority enrollment.  These supervised                             
              preservice experiences, as well as inservice training for                      
              participating classroom teachers, will be coordinated by a                     
              site-based director and guided by a  multidisciplinary                         
              advisory board.  The infrastructure needed to support this                     
              project will be built in three stages; 1) partnership                          
              planning; 2) model training; and 3) self-sufficiency                           
              development.  Master teachers, 2 from each of the 2 schools,                   
              will be selected from  a cadre of 20 teachers in the 2 BCPS                    
              schools.  These master teachers will be trained to                             
              coordinate the school-site tasks necessary to implement the                    
              program.  By 1994 the urban practicum will be a co-requisite                   
              of the science content/methods course in the TSU program.                      
                                                                                             
              In addition to NSF funding, this project is supported (28%)                    
              by Towson State University, the Baltimore City Public                          
              Schools, and Baltimore Gas and Electric.
