Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Kansas is offering a three year teacher                      
              enhancement project to develop elementary teacher-leaders in                   
              northeast Kansas schools.  For each of three years 42                          
              elementary teachers will attend a three-week workshop on                       
              mathematics content and pedagogy consistent with the NCTM                      
              Curriculum and Evaluation Standards.  The workshop will be                     
              led by a team of university mathematicians, mathematics                        
              educators, and elementary teachers.  Staff will work closely                   
              with participants to design appropriate follow-up activities                   
              during the school year and will make regular site visits.  A                   
              workshop for principals will also be held.  Since teachers                     
              will be encouraged to return for a second summer, and the                      
              workshop designed to facilitate such participation, it is                      
              estimated that the project will involve directly                               
              approximately 100 teachers.  Cost share by school districts                    
              and the university is approximately 21% of the project                         
              budget.
