Abstract    :
              The Political Science Department of The Ohio State University                  
              in conjunction with the American Political Science Association                 
              is conducting a three-week summer (1992) workshop on the                       
              teaching and research applications of statistical data                         
              analysis. The general objective is to enhance the instruction                  
              of undergraduates in the research practices of political                       
              scientists with access to a large variety of individual and                    
              aggregate, citizen and leader data on political and related                    
              phenomena.  This includes data on a number of democratic                       
              nations, international relations, elections of members of state                
              legislators, voting in the U.S. Congress, presidential                         
              elections, and the U.S. Supreme Court. One of the hallmarks of                 
              political science research has been a growing attention to                     
              systematic observation across time.  In addition to using a                    
              variety of statistical techniques, from bi-variate cross-                      
              tabulations to multi-variate analysis, experimentation with the                
              comparative advantages of data analysis, using programs on                     
              large mainframe computers, as opposed to programs designed for                 
              microcomputer processing, will be conducted.
