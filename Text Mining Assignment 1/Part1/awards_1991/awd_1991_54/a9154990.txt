Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              California State University @ Los Angeles will initiate a 4.5-week,            
              commuter Young Scholars project in Mathematics for 50 students                 
              entering grades 10-12.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Participants will study group theory, number theory and computer               
              applications of these topics.  In addition to attending lectures               
              and presentations, students will work on problem sets, engage in               
              library preparation for the careers being discussed, participate in            
              field trips to local university and industry sites, and write two              
              essays on relevant philosophical/ethical and career-related                    
              questions that have been raised.
