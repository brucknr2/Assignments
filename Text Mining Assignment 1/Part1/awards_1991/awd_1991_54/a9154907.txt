Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Kentucky will initiate a three-week, residential             
              Young Scholars project in the Earth Sciences which will offer                  
              science enrichment activities for 24 precollege students entering              
              grade 9.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This program is a hands-on experience involving laboratory,                    
              classroom and computer activities, and field trips.  Participants              
              will study content areas on landforms, energy production and usage,            
              water quality and forest ecology/resources.  Research methods,                 
              research mentorships and the use of technology will be integrated              
              into content units.  Mentoring will take place in university and               
              industrial laboratories.
