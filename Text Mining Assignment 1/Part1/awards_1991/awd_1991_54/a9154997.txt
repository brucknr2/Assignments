              The California State University @ San Bernardino will initiate a               
              six-week, residential, multidisciplinary Young Scholars project in             
              physics, mathematics and astronomy which will offer science                    
              enrichment activities for 39 precollege students entering grades 11            
              and 12.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize research participation in                   
              determining the orbit of an asteroid.  Students will be involved in            
              all aspects of the research project including taking photographic              
              plates, making astrometric measurements and final orbit                        
              computation.
