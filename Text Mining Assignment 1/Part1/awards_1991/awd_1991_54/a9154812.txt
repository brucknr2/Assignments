Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to conduct a regional                           
              cooperative program at the Texas Engineering Experiment School                 
              in College Station, Texas for the content and pedagogical                      
              training of twenty-four (24) under-prepared high school                        
              physics teachers over a three year period.  The project                        
              utilizes an instruction team of experienced, highly successful                 
              high school physics teachers who have been trained as Physics                  
              Teaching Resource Agents (PTRA's) in conjunction with physics                  
              professors from a community college and a university.  The                     
              project includes three components.  The first is a two week                    
              series of workshops conducted in the summer which focuses on                   
              the most challenging aspects of the basic concepts taught in                   
              the first year high school physics course.  The second                         
              component, conducted in November and March of the following                    
              academic year, is a series of follow-up workshops on                           
              supplementary topics.  The third component involves classroom                  
              and school visits by experienced teachers to provide                           
              participants with mentoring and assistance in the                              
              implementation and evaluation of the program.
