Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An annotated bibliography of more than 1200 items will be produced             
              covering Asian, African, Islamic Middle East, Latin American and               
              precontact North American science and medicine. This bibliography              
              should be of value to teachers, students and curriculum developers             
              who want to include examples of the cultural relativity of the                 
              scientific enterprise. The bibliography will be arranged by place              
              with an extensive subject index. The bibliography will be published            
              and the ideas disseminated to teachers through networks,                       
              partnerships, journals and talks.
