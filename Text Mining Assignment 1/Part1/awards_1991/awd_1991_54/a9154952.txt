Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge will initiate a six-             
              week, residential Young Scholars project in Astronomy and Space                
              Science for 24 students entering grade 11.                                     
                                                                                             
              Participants will learn the philosophy and methodology of science              
              research by immersion into the research activity of a senior staff             
              of twelve members of the Department of Physics and Astronomy and               
              other faculty in the physical science departments of the College of            
              Basic Sciences.  In addition, all students will participate for the            
              duration of the program in seminars led by the senior staff at LSU             
              and science departments in the other colleges and universities in              
              Louisiana who will present topics in their areas of specialization.            
              These seminars will expose the scholars to the nature and                      
              excitement of space research and its application to additional                 
              disciplines such as computer and information science, geophysics               
              and the environmental sciences.
