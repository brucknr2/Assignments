Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Southern Coalition for Modern Engineering Design Graphics at                   
              Two-Year Institutions                                                          
                                                                                             
              The project using a six-day workshop introduces faculty, who                   
              teach Engineering Design Graphics courses at two-year                          
              institutions to new methodology in Engineering Design Graphics                 
              and helps their institutions to develop and organize modern                    
              laboratories and modernized programs.  The project involves the                
              formation of a coalition composed of two four-year                             
              institutions, the University of Texas at Austin and Georgia                    
              Institute of Technology, and a larger number of two-year                       
              institutions in the Gulf and South-Atlantic states.  In                        
              addition, six leading educators, one from each state of the                    
              coalition region, will consult to provide  local input to the                  
              program.  A total of 48 faculty members from approximately 40                  
              two-year institutions will benefit directly from this project                  
              and through them several thousand students each year. Of that                  
              number 23% of the students are expected to be minorities and                   
              28% will transfer to four-year engineering colleges to complete                
              their B.S. degree.***//
