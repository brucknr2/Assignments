Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of New Hampshire will initiate a three-week,                    
              residential Young Scholars project in Marine Science, Mathematics              
              and Computer Science which will provide enrichment activities for              
              25 precollege students entering grade 10.                                      
                                                                                             
              This summer program consists of course work and field trips which              
              will integrate marine science, mathematics and computer science.               
              The Great Bay Estuary and the Isle of Shoals will be the sites of              
              field trips on which participants will perform a variety of                    
              measurements to contrast and compare fresh water, salt marsh, mud              
              flat and rocky coast environments.  The measurements by each                   
              student will be intercompared and also compared to baseline data.              
              Participants will be taught the computer and mathematical tools                
              necessary to take and analyze data and to make valid                           
              interpretations.  The investigation will be motivated by ecological            
              problems in the area.  Students will live part of the time with                
              faculty in mathematics and science.  There will be four one-day                
              workshops during the academic year, one of which will be a one-day             
              mini-experience for 75 students who were not chosen for the summer             
              program.
