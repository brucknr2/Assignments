Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Encyclopedia of the Environment is a comprehensive                         
              reference for Grades 5-9 that promotes science education by                    
              sing the environment as a theme.  It takes advantage of                        
              trends in both state/federal education strategies, which                       
              increasingly advocate environmental education, and in                          
              science reform efforts (e.g., Project 2061), which advocate                    
              the use of major integrating themes.  It will be                               
              interdisciplinary, including science history economics,                        
              geography, social studies, and humanities.  It will be

              separately indexed full-color volumes, using case studies to                   
              integrate topics.  Sidebars will contain interesting facts                     
              relevant information, explorations of science themes,                          
              literature, careers, and biographies.  The CD-ROM                              
              (publisher: Jostens Learning Corporation) will contain all

              narratives), possibly full motion video, and simulations.                      
              It will be searchable through multiple paths, including
