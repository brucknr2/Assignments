Abstract    :
              A five-day workshop for 30 mathematics faculty is being                        
              conducted to study and evaluate the impact of computer algebra                 
              systems (CAS) on the undergraduate mathematics curriculum.                     
              The focus is on pedagogical issues common to a range of upper                  
              level mathematics courses. This workshop addresses the                         
              question:  what are the implications of this technology for the                
              way mathematics faculty structure individual courses and for                   
              the curriculum as a whole?  The workshop is directed toward                    
              faculty who have experience using a CAS or other instructional                 
              software in mathematics courses.  Materials using computer                     
              algebra systems to teach mathematics effectively in upper                      
              division mathematics courses will be created by participants.                  
              These will be shared with participants and other interested                    
              persons.
