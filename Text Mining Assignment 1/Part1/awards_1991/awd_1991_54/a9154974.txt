Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The State University of New York at Binghamton will initiate a six-            
              week, summer residential, Young Scholars project in Chemistry for              
              15 students entering grades 11 and 12.                                         
                                                                                             
              The immediate goal of the Young Scholars Research Program (YSRP)               
              will be to enable qualified high school students, principally women            
              and minorities, to acquire the prerequisite skills, career                     
              awareness, philosophical and ethical attitudes necessary to                    
              encourage them to pursue successfully preprofessional or                       
              professional education studies in scientific, technical and health-            
              related fields via a consortium that includes SUNY-Binghamton,                 
              Broome Community College and various local companies.  Students'               
              views of numerous career opportunities in the sciences and related             
              fields will become broadened with exposure to a wide variety of                
              seminar topics, laboratory activities, university interactions and             
              industrial experiences.  They will have a unique opportunity to                
              become an integral working member of a research team.
