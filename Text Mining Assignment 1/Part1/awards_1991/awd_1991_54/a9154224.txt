Abstract    :
              Few practicing engineers and scientists, educators, and                        
              students have a working understanding of the principles of                     
              pollution prevention.  The objective of this seminar is to both                
              present a course and develop a problem workbook on pollution                   
              prevention in order to address this need and resolve this                      
              technology gap. The workbook, problems and solutions will be                   
              generated by an environmental, but interdisciplinary, team of                  
              engineering and applied science faculty.  Topics include:                      
              Regulations, Process Plant Fundamentals and Applications,                      
              Project Analysis and Economics, Audit Principles, Source                       
              Reduction Approaches, Recycling Approaches, Other Control                      
              Options, Industrial Applications, and Case Studies.  The first                 
              draft of the problem workbook will be prepared in the summer of                
              1992. The 1992-93 academic year will provide an opportunity to                 
              classroom-test the effectiveness of the problems in the                        
              workbook.  A three-day follow-up session in late June of 1993                  
              is also scheduled to provide an opportunity to revise, update,                 
              edit, etc., the workbook.
