Abstract    :
              A one week workshop on computer-aided spectroscopy involving                   
              Fourier transform infrared and Fourier transform nuclear                       
              magnetic resonance spectroscopies.  The workshop consists of                   
              both lecture and laboratory sessions with extensive hands-on                   
              experience with the instruments.  A handbook containing the                    
              materials, experiments and data files used in conjunction with                 
              the workshop will be available for use at the participants'                    
              home institutions.The week long workshop is followed by a                      
              three-day seminar on the initiation and funding of                             
              undergraduate research programs.  The emphasis will be on                      
              attracting financial support, motivating students, and                         
              developing curricula to support undergraduate research                         
              programs.
