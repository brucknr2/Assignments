Abstract    :
              This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority                
              Research Initiation program of the NSF, will provide for support               
              to develop a research proposal to address increased dissipation of             
              energy associated with oscillatory flows.  Research in this area               
              is particularly relevant in biomedical engineering, especially in              
              technology associated with gas transport, hemodialysis, and heat               
              transfer.
