Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of California @ Los Angeles (UCLA) will initiate a              
              four-week, residential Young Scholars project in the Life Sciences             
              which will offer science enrichment activities for 25 physically               
              disabled precollege students entering grades 9,10.                             
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize research participation in                   
              biology, microbiology, physiology and marine science.  Participants            
              will research and debate ethical issues.  Nonacademic scientists,              
              executives and career planners will help inform the students about             
              colleges and careers and will aid them in setting challenging and              
              realistic goals.  More than half of all senior academic and                    
              professional staff will be individuals with disabilities.
