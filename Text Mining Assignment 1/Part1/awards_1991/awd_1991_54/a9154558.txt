Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will carry out research to test the hypothesis                    
              that when high school physics teachers learn a guided,                         
              hands-on inquiry approach to teaching physics and apply this                   
              to their students, the student will develop a better                           
              understanding of physics and become more interested in                         
              science.  Furthermore this will result in students                             
              continuing to take science in their later educational                          
              activities and perhaps embarking upon science careers.  The                    
              research will involve a double strand study comparing                          
              students whose teachers have taken teacher enhancement                         
              projects emphasizing special techniques with those whose                       
              teachers who have not.  The research will isolate and                          
              quantify indicators which determine the extent to which                        
              students have been influenced by teachers using techniques                     
              developed in teacher enhancement workshops.  The results                       
              will help guide the development of teacher enhancement                         
              programs.  The institution is providing a 30% match to the                     
              NSF grant.
