Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Hughes Aircraft Company is contributing up to $15M and a                       
              corporate platform to develop the Hughes GALAXY Classroom                      
              (SM) targeted for educationally at-risk children in our                        
              nation's elementary schools.  It is a systematic program to                    
              strengthen curriculum through the development of video-based                   
              supplementary educational materials distributed,                               
              unscrambled, via a dedicated satellite interactive network                     
              without commercial advertising.  Hughes GALAXY Classroom                       
              (SM) includes integrated classroom activities and materials                    
              and a strong enhancement program for teachers,                                 
              administrators, and parents.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The three-year demonstration will include two 13-part                          
              science video programs (closed captioned, Spanish track) for                   
              grades K-2 and 3-5 and comparable programs for English-                        
              language arts, broadcast to 37 representative urban and                        
              rural elementary schools (and one in Mexico), reaching 190                     
              classrooms and teachers and 6,000 students.  Also, included                    
              will be hands-on science curriculum materials and                              
              substantial formative and independent summative evaluations.                   
                                                                                             
              The following operational phase will provide an expanded                       
              curriculum with a goal of 20,000 schools by the year 2000,                     
              supported by public and private funding sources.                               
                                                                                             
              A prestigious eight-member Science Advisory Board will guide                   
              the Project.
