Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This mathematics and science education conference is                           
              designed to bring together representatives from a large                        
              number of professional societies and other organizations                       
              within the applied sciences and engineering, in order to                       
              share knowledge, report on activities, and reflect on                          
              recent experiences.  Many of these professional                                
              organizations have already committed substantial resources                     
              to their K-12 projects and even produced materials, held                       
              curriculum workshops, and begun school and school system                       
              partnerships.  This conference will begin the coordination                     
              among such efforts and should stimulate others to increase                     
              their involvement with precollege science education.  The                      
              first conference will be held in February of 1992 and will                     
              be followed by a smaller conference in April of that same                      
              year.  The April follow-up conference will involve                             
              representatives from twelve applied science and engineering                    
              societies to discuss plans for on going cooperation in the                     
              effort to improve mathematics, science, and engineering                        
              education at the precollege level.
