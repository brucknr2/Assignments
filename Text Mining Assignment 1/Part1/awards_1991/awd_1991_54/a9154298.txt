Abstract    :
              The North Carolina Super-computing Center (NCSC) is conducting                 
              a three-week Summer Institute which emphasizes the                             
              interdisciplinary nature of computational science by recruiting                
              teams of faculty members from the same institution in the                      
              disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and the physical                 
              or life sciences.  During the Summer Institute, participants                   
              receive a firm grounding in the principles and practice of                     
              computational science.  Special training in super-computing,                   
              parallel computing, and visualization are incorporated into the                
              schedule.  The program includes continuous support and                         
              coordination through use of NCSC's advanced interactive video                  
              network, access to the high-performance computing and                          
              visualization environment at NCSC, and mentors at top research                 
              universities who work with the participants throughout the                     
              year.
