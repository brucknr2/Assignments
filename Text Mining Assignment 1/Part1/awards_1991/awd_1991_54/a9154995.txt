Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff will initiate a six-week,             
              commuter Young Scholars project in Physics and Computer Science for            
              16 students entering grades 10 and 11.                                         
                                                                                             
              Morning sessions will focus on classroom instruction and hands-on              
              activities in physics and computer usage.  Afternoons will be                  
              devoted completely to research activities.  Participants will write            
              a paper and make a presentation about their research projects at               
              the end of the summer activities; parents and teachers will be                 
              invited to attend the paper presentations.
