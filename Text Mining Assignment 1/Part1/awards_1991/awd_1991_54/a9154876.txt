Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Indiana State University will initiate a three-week,                       
              residential Young Scholars project in Life Science for 24 students             
              entering grades 11 and 12.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The theme of this project is "Our Nutritional Environment."  Each              
              participant will select a problem, conduct a literature survey,                
              develop an experimental design, collect and analyze data, prepare              
              a scientific manuscript, and give an oral presentation of the                  
              research.  The philosophical and sociological implications of                  
              science in general and this type of research in specific will be               
              presented as continuous and interwoven components of the project.              
              Guest lecturers, research scientists and faculty will introduce the            
              students to a wide variety of careers in biology.
