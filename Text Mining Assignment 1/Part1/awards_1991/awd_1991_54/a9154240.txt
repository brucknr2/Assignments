Abstract    :
              This program presents information and hands-on experience for                  
              planning, designing, building and operating wet lands to serve                 
              two functions simultaneously:  (1) wet lands habitat and (2)                   
              waste water treatment.  Participants from engineering and the                  
              biological sciences interact with experts in the various                       
              aspects of this technology.  Lectures are presented, followed                  
              by field trips, laboratory assignments, and interaction with                   
              the experts.  Long term continuation of the project is                         
              accomplished through a quarterly newsletter and                                
              teleconferencing with a second follow-up workshop of one week,                 
              a year after the first two-week workshop.
