Abstract    :
              The program will be directed at the thoughtful introduction of                 
              modern technology into the undergraduate mathematics classroom                 
              using the University of Arizona's software and will consist of                 
              two components. A ten day workshop during which the                            
              participants learn about technology in the classroom and create                
              instructional material which they can take back with them.  The                
              workshop will be divided into several parts: Seeing software                   
              demonstrations and completing software assignments; Textbook                   
              examination for appropriate incorporation of technology;                       
              discussion of new material, and individual experimentation with                
              software. A three day follow-up meeting held the following                     
              January during which participants will report back on what they                
              did, sharing the ideas and experiences they gained from                        
              implementing technology in the classroom  and raise specific                   
              problems they have encountered.
