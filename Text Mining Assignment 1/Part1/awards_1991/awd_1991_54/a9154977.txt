Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Utah will initiate a five-week, commuter Young               
              Scholars project in Computer Science which will provide science                
              enrichment activities for 40 precollege students entering grades               
              11,12.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize research participation in                   
              computer graphics and intelligent systems.  Students will learn                
              about two- and three-dimensional representation techniques and will            
              design models of their choice.  They will then study different ways            
              of rendering surfaces for their models and explore problems of                 
              current research interest.  In the artificial intelligence and                 
              expert systems component of the program, students will study LISP              
              and rule-based programming.  They will then develop an expert                  
              system to control an autonomous "rover" which is a part of a                   
              simulated space probe.  They will visit robotics and computer-                 
              aided-manufacturing research laboratories.
