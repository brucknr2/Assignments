              The Virginia Commonwealth University will initiate a three-week,               
              commuter Young Scholars EARLY ALERT project in Mathematics and                 
              Physics for 30 students entering grade 7.                                      
                                                                                             
              The Richmond Area Young Scholars Program emphasizes mathematics and            
              physics and is designed for rising 7th grade Black students in the             
              Richmond area.  Honors topics instruction will be provided by                  
              university faculty and by pre-college faculty who are members of               
              the active Mathematics Teacher Professional Network.  Participant              
              interest in mathematics and physics will be nurtured; students will            
              report on small group interactions with industry and academic                  
              researchers, and will conduct and report on small-scale research               
              projects.
