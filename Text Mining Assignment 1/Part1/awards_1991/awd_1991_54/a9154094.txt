Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop a year-long, event-based science                     
              (EBS) curriculum for heterogeneously grouped, middle school                    
              students for use primarily in departmentalized earth science                   
              classes.  Nationally disseminated products will include                        
              textbook, teacher resource notebook, and video tape and/or                     
              videodisc support.  Five features will set EBS apart from                      
              other approaches to science instruction and curriculum                         
              writing. 1)  The event focus will make each unit topical and                   
              relevant to early adolescents.  It will allow science to                       
              become less compartmentalized.  It allows for a natural                        
              highlighting of nontraditional roles filled by women and                       
              minorities.  2)  The interdisciplinary nature of this even                     
              focus will be enhanced by the collaboration between project                    
              writers and teacher/advisory and consultant panels.  Three                     
              teacher/advisory panels of Montgomery County Public School                     
              (MCPS) earth science teachers will contribute content and                      
              activity ideas.  3)  A team of eighth grade students will                      
              tests materials as they are developed.  Particular attention                   
              will be paid to interest reactions of the students.  High                      
              interest activities will become models for other activities.                   
              4)  EBS will stress alternative assessment techniques and                      
              grading strategies which reward success and downplay                           
              failure.  5)  EBS will utilize the news media as one source.                   
              6)  EBS will be a national project developed as a                              
              collaborative effort of MCPS, the US Government, and                           
              professional and news agencies.  Montgomery County is                          
              uniquely positioned to take advantage of the help available                    
              from these agencies.
