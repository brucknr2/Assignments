Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The UIC-Maneuvers project is to develop five replacement units                 
              for the middle grades.  These will be continuations of five                    
              previously developed modules.  There will be modules on topics                 
              such as Percent and Sports, Speeds, and Sizes.  The use of                     
              scientific calculators will be involved as a key element in each               
              module.  In addition, open ended problems will be emphasized.                  
              Material for teachers and parents will be developed as well.                   
                                                                                             
              There will be a formative evaluation in the development of the                 
              material and a summative evaluation of the entire project                      
              including assessment of student learning.                                      
                                                                                             
              Finally, the modules finished under a previous project were                    
              published by Dale Seymour and he has indicated an interest in                  
              the proposed modules.
