Abstract    :
              Two workshops for 55 participants during the summer of 1992                    
              will introduce undergraduate mathematics faculty to interesting                
              new topics in calculus and precalculus designed to enhance the                 
              core curriculum, rejuvenate teachers, and interest students.                   
              Although many of the examples will use the microcomputer as a                  
              tool, the emphasis will be on mathematics. Also included will                  
              be lectures by a plant pathologist on applications of chaos in                 
              biology and by an astronomer on calculus and planetary motion.                 
              An important feature of the project will be the publication of                 
              materials for national dissemination.  These will supplement                   
              the principal investigators' NSF sponsored book 'Uses of                       
              Technology in the Mathematics Curriculum':  A Manual of                        
              Laboratory Exercises and Resources for College Teachers.
