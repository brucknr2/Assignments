Abstract    :
              The program introduces faculty members from regional colleges                  
              and institutions to new types of computer-based technology.                    
              Emphasis will be on the integration of these technologies into                 
              existing science courses, especially at the introductory level.                
              The two week intensive training workshop will present                          
              information on video disc technology, CD-ROM materials,                        
              telecommunications, and multimedia applications.  Participants                 
              will see and use examples of materials that are available in                   
              their specific disciplines.  Sufficient hands-on opportunities                 
              will be provided to enable participants to become proficient                   
              with the use of available materials.  They will be expected to                 
              integrate the new technology into classes at their home                        
              institutions and to share their knowledge and expertise with                   
              other faculty members.
