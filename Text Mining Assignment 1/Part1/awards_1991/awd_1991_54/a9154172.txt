Abstract    :
              Most of classical applied mathematics, and essentially all of                  
              undergraduate training in applied mathematics, is dominated by                 
              direct problems in which given causes evolve continuously into                 
              effects which are to be determined.  In recent years there has                 
              been a great deal of research activity in inverse problems,                    
              that is, problems of determining a cause of a given effect or                  
              a law of evolution given a cause and effect.  A three day                      
              regional workshop is offered to acquaint undergraduate faculty                 
              with some of the peculiar mathematical and computational                       
              difficulties associated with inverse problems and to assist                    
              them in developing curricular materials on aspects of inverse                  
              problems. Follow up activities will include a special session                  
              at a regional Mathematical Association of America meeting. The                 
              majority of the support for this workshop is being provided by                 
              the Division of Mathematical Sciences.
