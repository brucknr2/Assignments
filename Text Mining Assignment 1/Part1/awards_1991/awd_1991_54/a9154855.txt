Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Consumer Reports Television will produce a series of four half-                
              hour TV specials and companion outreach materials, called "YOU                 
              TEST IT|," for public television broadcast and broad educational               
              and home video distribution.  Targeted for children ages 7 to 13               
              -- particularly those from low-income, minority families -- the                
              project will draw on the resources of Consumers Union, the non-                
              profit, scientific, research and education organization that                   
              publishes Consumer Reports magazine and ZILLIONS, the Consumer                 
              Reports for Kids.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The "YOU TEST IT| series, created by an experienced team of                    
              children's TV producers, focuses on testing and evaluating                     
              popular products -- from observing the bubble-power of bubble                  
              gum to measuring the efficiency of 10-speed bicycles.  Using                   
              lively, state-of-the-art techniques appealing to kids, "YOU TEST               
              IT|" will encourage children to use science and math skills to                 
              investigate and, ultimately, solve real-world problems.  Each of               
              the 4 programs will cover a broad product theme such as                        
              Foods/Snacks, Toys/Games, Sports/Recreation, and Electronic                    
              Gear.  Activity Guides, expanding on these topics, will delve                  
              more deeply into the science content of each show, providing                   
              hands-on learning materials for children.                                      
                                                                                             
              With repeated broadcasts of "YOU TEST IT|" over hundreds of PBS                
              stations, and reuse of tape and print materials, millions of                   
              children will gain greater access to objective product                         
              information and greater awareness of science and its importance                
              in everyday life.
