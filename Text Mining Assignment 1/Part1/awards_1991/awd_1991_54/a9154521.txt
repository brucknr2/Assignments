Abstract    :
              This planning grant will concentrate on                                        
              obtaining preliminary data to support the                                      
              writing of a full proposal concerning the                                      
              quantitative imaging of regional pulmonary                                     
              blood flow.  The final goal is to study the                                    
              three-dimensional distribution of pulmonary                                    
              blood flow using single photon emission                                        
              tomography (SPECT) which has been corrected                                    
              for attenuation effects and which has been                                     
              collected using respiratory gating                                             
              techniques.  During the planning grant the PI                                  
              will concentrate on constructing a                                             
              physical model of the pulmonary system,                                        
              developing algorithms for attenuation                                          
              correction and techniques for respiratory                                      
              gating and learning methods to manipulate                                      
              SPECT data.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This project is very timely since it deals                                     
              with the analysis of 3-D image data.  The                                      
              proposal is well-written and the approaches                                    
              that will be used are justified.  The                                          
              preliminary studies should help develop a                                      
              competitive full-proposal in the field of                                      
              SPECT medical imaging.
