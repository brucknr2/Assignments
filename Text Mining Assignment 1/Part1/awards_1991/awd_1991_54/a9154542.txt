Abstract    :
              This is a minority research initiation (MRI) planning grant.  The              
              research will investigate three issues in the usability of                     
              hypertext related to skill level.  The approach to be taken will               
              address the learning issue by long durations to assess                         
              performance during browsing activities as a function of skill                  
              development.  Improvement in hypertext usage via new control                   
              mechanisms will be studied by embedding an expert-tutor/advisor                
              within the hypertext system to monitor student progress.  The                  
              proper amount of control will be studied as a function of user                 
              skill and subgroups (high-control seekers versus low-control                   
              seekers).  The final aspect is to study how different users                    
              navigate a hypertext document.  Specifically, are there                        
              identifiable paths or strategies taken for users with different                
              strategies, styles, skills or motivations.
