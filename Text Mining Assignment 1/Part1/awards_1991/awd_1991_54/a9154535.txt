Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will establish what the nation's postsecondary                     
              institutions are currently doing to support  K-12                              
              educational networking, and will create and distribute a                       
              packet of materials that can assist college administrators,                    
              educators and technical staff attempting to support local K-                   
              12 educational groups and organizations.  The packet wil                       
              also be useful to state departments of education and other                     
              K-12 organizations.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Postsecondary institutions will be surveyed, using EDUCOM                      
              member organizations and other groups; information will also                   
              be sought through various electronic mail lists and                            
              conferences.  Questions will include current and planned                       
              activities in support of K-12 educationl networking; the                       
              existence of policy statements regarding institutional                         
              involvement with K-12 organizations; and interest in further                   
              involvement.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The materials packet will e developed through consultation                     
              with experts in K-12 networking issues, including known                        
              groups with K-12 networking systems operating over the                         
              Internet.  Support programs involved in K-12 science and                       
              mathematics education will be included.  Contents of the                       
              packet will include: principles and suggested guidelines for                   
              institutional involvement; program descriptions (including                     
              interface screen captures) for K-12 networking interfaces;                     
              an outline of a user manual oriented toward K-12 users; and                    
              a "user roadmap" of resources accessible over the Internet.                    
                                                                                             
              The packet and survey results will be actively disseminated                    
              through K-12 and postsecondary meetings and conferences, as                    
              printed materials and through electronic networks.
