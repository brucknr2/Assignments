Abstract    :
              The Project for Undergraduate Computer Science Faculty                         
              Enhancement and Materials Development in the Central Texas                     
              Region has several objectives:  participants learn about new                   
              computing curricula guidelines, experience technical seminars                  
              presented by experts, and take part in demonstrations on recent                
              advances relevant to undergraduate curricula; each participant                 
              contributes to the development of instructional materials for                  
              classroom and laboratory use; and the activities of the project                
              foster an active professional relationship among participating                 
              schools.  A workshop during the summer includes hands-on                       
              demonstrations, presentations, discussions, and seminars, with                 
              ample time for materials development.  These materials shared                  
              with non-participating faculty members at the home institutions                
              through dissemination workshops and piloted at each institution                
              throughout the academic year.  Monthly meetings and an                         
              evaluation session allow participants to compare experiences of                
              usage and improve materials as necessary, as well as encourage                 
              sustained interaction.  The pedagogical package is to be                       
              delivered to the undergraduate computer science education                      
              community via technical journals or in published form.
