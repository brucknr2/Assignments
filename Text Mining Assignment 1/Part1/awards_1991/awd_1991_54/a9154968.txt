Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Massachusetts Institute of Technology will initiate a three-               
              week, commuter Young Scholars Early Alert Initiative project in                
              Mathematics and Physics which will provide science enrichment                  
              activities for 30 precollege students entering grades 7-9.                     
                                                                                             
              This summer and academic year program which takes place at the                 
              Haystack Observatory will allow students to participate in                     
              applications of mathematics and physics to astronomy, geophysics,              
              and atmospheric science involving experimental observations and                
              studies of astronomical sources of radio emissions; measurements of            
              distances, velocities and vectors, analysis of plate motion data               
              and studies of earthquakes; and investigations of the earth's                  
              atmosphere, its variations and man's effects on the environment.               
              In the follow-up academic year program a staff mentor will be                  
              assigned to each participant and each student will work on an                  
              individual project to be presented at a science-fair style event at            
              the Observatory.
