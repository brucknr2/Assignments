Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will establish an Algebra Institute where a                       
              series of five workshops in algebra are to be presented by a                   
              Presidential Awardee teacher, two master teachers, two                         
              university professors, and the New Hampshire Department of                     
              Education Curriculum Supervisor.                                               
                                                                                             
              Forty teacher/leaders participating in the 1991-92 academic                    
              year will learn content new to the mathematics curriculum,                     
              develop pedagogic methods, and become capable users of                         
              technology.  In addition, the teacher/leaders will provide in-                 
              service activities for teachers in their respective areas and                  
              will develop area networks of mathematics educators to promote                 
              the implementation of changes in the teaching of algebra.                      
              Follow-up networking activities include meetings of                            
              participants in the summer of 1992 and the spring of 1993 and                  
              an opportunity for 16 regional 1990 and 1991 Presidential                      
              Awardees in Mathematics to review the project and interact                     
              with the participants to identify aspects of the project which                 
              could be replicated in their states.
