Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A strong need exists for more inclusion of hands-on                            
              investigative science in the high school curriculum.                           
              Current school budgets, however, often lack of money to                        
              purchase adequate materials and equipment for hands-on                         
              science.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              One immediate remedy for the problem is the production and                     
              dissemination of a laboratory manual of effective hands-on                     
              investigative activities that require little or no money to                    
              implement.  The National Association of Biology Teachers                       
              (NABT) staff plans to recruit excellent, experienced high                      
              school teachers to write and field test these activities,                      
              modifying them as needed for special populations of                            
              students, including the physically disabled, gifted, and                       
              disadvantaged.  NABT staff members will oversee all phases                     
              of the project, and biologists and science educators will                      
              review materials to assure their quality.  The most                            
              successful activities will then be distributed to high                         
              school biology teachers throughout the country through                         
              mailings and in-service workshops.                                             
                                                                                             
              The goal of the project is to increase the teaching of                         
              biology as a process rather than as a collection of facts.                     
              The objectives of the project are to enable the teaching of                    
              hands-on investigative biology by (1) providing teachers                       
              process-oriented biology.  High school biology teachers and                    
              their students will benefit from this project.
