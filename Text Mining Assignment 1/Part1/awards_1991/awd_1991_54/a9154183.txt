Abstract    :
              Two five-day summer workshops concerned with the development                   
              and use of computer software in the instruction of core                        
              mathematics courses will be conducted for 50 undergraduate                     
              mathematics faculty.  The first workshop will provide                          
              opportunities for undergraduate faculty to explore key concepts                
              from group theory including transformation groups, composition                 
              of transformations, commutativity and noncommutativity, and                    
              group extension.  The second workshop will focus on discrete                   
              algorithmic mathematics.  Both workshops will combine classroom                
              lectures and discussion with extensive hands-on computer work                  
              by the participants.
