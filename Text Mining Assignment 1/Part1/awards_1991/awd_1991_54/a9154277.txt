Abstract    :
              The one-week workshop on lasers and their application to                       
              solving chemical problems providing exposure to both the theory                
              and practical application of laser technology to all branches                  
              of chemistry for 15 chemistry faculty.  The course will                        
              includes:  (1) lectures on the fundamentals of lasers and                      
              related topics, (2) laboratory experiments to illustrate the                   
              principles presented in lectures, (3) lectures and laboratory                  
              experiments dealing with current applications of lasers to                     
              chemically interesting problems, and (4) an opportunity to                     
              engage in a special project of interest to the participant, the                
              technology of which will be transportable to the participant's                 
              home institution.
