Abstract    :
              The two-week workshop is being conducted at the National Training              
              Center in Denver, Colorado, for 25 selected undergraduate college              
              instructors of introductory courses with hydrology and water                   
              resources content.  The major purposes of the workshop are:  (a) to            
              bring participants up-to-date on the science of hydrology and those            
              technologies used to measure, analyze, and calculate hydrologic                
              flows, surface and groundwater resources, and pollutant loadings               
              and consequences, and (b) to equip and encourage these teachers to             
              use the latest in water resources information and instructional                
              materials in their classrooms.  Educational materials developed by             
              Workshop participants will be presented at the Twenty-Ninth Annual             
              American Water Resources Association Conference in Fall 1993.
