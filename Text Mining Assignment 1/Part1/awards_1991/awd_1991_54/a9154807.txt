Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this program is to conduct a three day                          
              conference to develop guidelines for the pre-college                           
              teaching of genetic engineering, and for the preparation of                    
              teachers and the formation of networks and partnerships                        
              that facilitate the introduction of high quality, up-to-                       
              date, science education about genetic engineering.                             
              Conference participants will include biology teachers                          
              experienced in teaching genetic engineering;  Teacher                          
              Enhancement project personnel who are experienced in this                      
              and related areas, and other individuals experienced in                        
              alliances, partnerships and networking in support of                           
              science education programs in biotechnology.                                   
                                                                                             
              The conference will address three main areas relative to                       
              genetic engineering: 1) pre-college academic content,                          
              including basic biology of genetic engineering,                                
              technological applications, social\ethical issues, and                         
              economic issues, 2) teacher enhancement, and 3) the role of                    
              alliances, partnerships and networks in implementing new                       
              science education programs. Pre-conference papers will be                      
              developed in each of these three areas so that conference                      
              participants can respond to them. Discussion results will                      
              then be used to produce a set of recommended guidelines for                    
              future teacher enhancement programs in the area of genetic                     
              engineering. The guidelines, along with the pre-conference                     
              papers, will be incorporated into a Conference Report that                     
              will be made available to all interested individuals.                          
                                                                                             
              An amount equal to 13.5% of NSF costs will be provided as                      
              cost sharing.
