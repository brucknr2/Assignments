Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Washington will initiate a four-week, commuter               
              Young Scholars Early Alert Initiative project which will provide               
              science enrichment activities for 40 precollege students entering              
              grades 7 and 8.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This program will provide students with an opportunity to work in              
              small groups with University faculty and students, as well as with             
              peers who have the same interests.  The first week will focus on               
              proficiency in the use of computers and activities to facilitate               
              collaborative learning; the second on electricity; the third on                
              machines; and the fourth on the physics of robotics.  Each unit                
              will include a team project, a mathematics investigation, career               
              exploration and an ethical "dilemma".
