Abstract    :
              This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority                
              Research Initiation program of the NSF, will provide for support               
              to develop a research proposal in the area of hot electron versus              
              phonon-assisted tunneling currents as they pertain to double                   
              barrier resonant tunneling structures (DBRTS).  Experimental                   
              results along these lines could significantly impact physical                  
              device issues of peak-to-valley currents, thereby resulting in a               
              substantial increase in quantum mechanical tunneling with, in turn,            
              enhanced electrical current.
