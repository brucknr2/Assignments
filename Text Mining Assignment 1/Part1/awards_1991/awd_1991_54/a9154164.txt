Abstract    :
              The NSF Summer Institute on Micro-scale Organic Laboratory                     
              Techniques is designed to assist faculty who contemplate                       
              undertaking this type of laboratory approach by introducing                    
              them to the experimental methods involved.  The Institute is                   
              organized around a framework of lecture-demonstrations,                        
              laboratory exercises, and informal group discussions of micro-                 
              scale techniques.  'Hands-on" laboratory experience is                         
              emphasized with particular attention paid to manipulative                      
              procedures involved in preparation, isolation, purification,                   
              and characterization of reaction products at the milligram                     
              level.
