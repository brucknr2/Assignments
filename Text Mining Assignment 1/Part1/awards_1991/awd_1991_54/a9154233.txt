Abstract    :
              This project is a two week workshop in which faculty from                      
              institutions which lack significant parallel computing                         
              resources learn how to deliver effective courses and units on                  
              parallel processing.  The tools used during the workshop                       
              include transputers which can be installed in existing personal                
              computers or work stations, software simulators, and a network                 
              connection to a major research center.  The primary topics are                 
              (1) parallel computer architectures, (2) writing programs for                  
              parallel computers, (3) integrating parallel processing into                   
              the computer science curriculum, and (4) teaching parallel                     
              processing to undergraduates.  The workshop includes lectures                  
              and laboratory sessions in which participants write programs                   
              for parallel computers and parallel computer simulators.                       
              Participants also plan a course or unit on parallel processing                 
              to be implemented at their institutions during the subsequent                  
              academic year.
