Abstract    :
              The Institute seeks to improve mathematics, science and engineering            
              programs at community colleges nationwide by more fully involving              
              key community college disciplinary leaders in national educational             
              and scientific activities. It is  creating a broader awareness                 
              among faculty at community colleges of the scope and mission                   
              of the National Science Foundation, the two-year college divisions             
              of their respective academic disciplinary societies, and the                   
              American Association of Community and Junior Colleges. The                     
              participating interns are learning of technological advances and of            
              grant policies and procedures and are disseminating this knowledge             
              to others in their community. The experiences of the interns                   
              include: extensive participation "on site" at NSF in agency                    
              activities related to strengthening education; participation in                
              seminars/workshops; interviews, discussions and other activities               
              with the AACJC and the respective academic discipline associations.            
              Each intern is participating fully in internal NSF activities                  
              and is assigned to one of the EHR divisions.
