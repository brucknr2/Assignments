Abstract    :
              The goal of the investigation is to develop the preliminary                    
              analysis and computer codes for studying phased arrays of                      
              microstrip elements on inhomogeneous substrates.  The                          
              analysis is based on an application of the equivalence                         
              principle transforming a nonplanar problem into one with                       
              parallel-plate regions which can be solved using a                             
              combination of the Green's function/moment method approach                     
              and mode matching techniques.  The method seeks to calculate                   
              for a particular scan the element input impedance and the                      
              expansion mode coefficients defining the current                               
              distribution.  The effects of the substrate inhomogeneity on                   
              the array scan performance are considered and the results                      
              are compared to those of the homogeneous microstrip phased                     
              array.
