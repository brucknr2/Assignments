Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The use of economic sanctions as instruments of foreign policy is              
              a time honored practice.  However, as the continuing debate about              
              the use of sanctions by the United States against nations such as              
              South Africa and Iraq demonstrates, there is little agreement about            
              the effectiveness of sanctions.  In some places at some times                  
              sanctions appear to have produced desirable results; in other                  
              places and other times they have not.  Previous research on the                
              topic is inconclusive, in part because none of the existing studies            
              has undertaken systematic and rigorous assessments of the use of               
              sanctions in different contexts and under varying conditions.                  
                                                                                             
              This very promising Minority Research Initiation planning grant                
              will support preliminary research on the conditions under which                
              economic sanctions are likely to be more or less effective.  The               
              planning grant will support an exhaustive review of the literature,            
              a survey of extant data sources, and development of a systematic               
              research design for conducting further research on this important              
              topic.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              When completed this project should provide the basic for launching             
              a systematic and rigorous study of the efficacy of economic                    
              sanctions as instruments of foreign policy. //
