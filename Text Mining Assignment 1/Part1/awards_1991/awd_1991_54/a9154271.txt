Abstract    :
              This national pilot program builds on an earlier project, and                  
              provides an additional three workshops for experienced                         
              community college physics teachers.  These workshops are                       
              scheduled during 1992 at three geographically-dispersed                        
              community college campuses.  Two workshops cover the use of                    
              microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL).  The other workshop                    
              deals with conceptual exercises (CE) and overview case studies                 
              (OCS) which apply the findings of cognitive physics                            
              research.Each three-day workshop is led by two                                 
              university/college physics professors who play a major role in                 
              these areas.  These hands-on workshops facilitate the                          
              incorporation of this new knowledge at community colleges.  The                
              impact of the workshops is reinforced by the establishment of                  
              a networking system employing a telecommunications bulletin                    
              board system and a newsletter.  The ultimate purpose of this                   
              project is to help community college students develop a                        
              stronger understanding of classical and contemporary physics.                  
              The task of updating physics programs at community colleges is                 
              difficult but essential for the nation and for science because                 
              of the large number of students, particularly women and                        
              minorities, attending community colleges.
