Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              No evidence currently exists to support the contention that                    
              the psychometric differences between performance (portfolio)                   
              assessment and multiple-choice assessment can be reconciled                    
              and that different performance assessments administered to                     
              different groups of students can ever be combined and                          
              summarized in educationally meaningful ways.                                   
                                                                                             
              The proposed study represents a multi-year investigation of                    
              the ability of elementary and middle school science and                        
              mathematics teachers, students, parents, and evaluators to                     
              develop and reach consensus on portfolio assessments to                        
              produce aggregate data within individual schools and across                    
              which exhibit diversity along key dimensions (size,                            
              location, racial/ethnic makeup of student population, etc).                    
                                                                                             
              Formative and summative measures (ranging from low-inference                   
              to high-inference)  will be used to evaluate the proposed                      
              activities in terms of four targets:  utility of the model,                    
              feasibility of the consensus-building process,                                 
              meaningfulness - for multiple users - of the data, and                         
              extent to which the project was implemented as proposed.
