Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Science/Math Resource Center at Montana State University will              
              initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars project in                   
              multidisciplinary science activities for 15 students entering                  
              grades 8 and 9.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This project will connect high-ability/high-potential junior high              
              students with a science/engineering university for science-related             
              career exploration activities. The schedule includes a three-week              
              summer residential program of lab and field experiences followed by            
              a structured computer-network set of activities designed to connect            
              participants in their local setting with each other as well as with            
              university scientists and career counselors throughout the academic            
              year.  Two other weekend meetings are held during the academic year            
              to expose these Young Scholars to the two other science/math/                  
              engineering universities in the state.
