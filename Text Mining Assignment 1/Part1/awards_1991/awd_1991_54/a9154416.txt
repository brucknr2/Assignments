Abstract    :
              The goal of this Planning Grant is to investigate the mechanisms               
              by which the cells of the kidney move organic electrolytes from the            
              blood into the excreted urine.  This is an important mechanism                 
              involving the expenditure of cellular energy to move these                     
              substances but a mechanism that is poorly understood at the present            
              time.  The long-term objective of this research, therefore, is to              
              understand this process at the molecular level.  To this end, the              
              present project will involve the development of new methods for the            
              study of intact kidney tubules and of surface membranes of the                 
              cells lining these tubules.  The transport process occurs across               
              these membranes.  Once these methods are successfully in use, the              
              applicant will then be in position to submit a full Minority                   
              Research Initiation proposal that addresses the mechanisms involved            
              in the transport of these organic substances.
