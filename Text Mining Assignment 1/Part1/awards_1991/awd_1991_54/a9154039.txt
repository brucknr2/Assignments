Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The purpose of the California State University -Fresno                    
              Project MOST program is to provide opportunity for college-                    
              eligible underrepresented students to explore, in nurturing                    
              environment, the possibility of becoming middle school science                 
              teachers.  The program consists of a series of newly designed                  
              science and education courses, and support by a                                
              counseling/tutorial service provided by the CSU office of                      
              Science Careers Opportunity Program (SCOP).  Participating                     
              undergraduate students will strengthen their knowledge in                      
              science and mathematics.  A specially designed science                         
              education program underrepresented teacher candidates will be                  
              designed to lead to credentials in life and/or physical                        
              science.  The program will begin in the Fall, 1992 and run for                 
              five years.  The program has been designed as a long range                     
              program to ensure continuity beyond the duration of this                       
              project.  New minority candidates will be brought into the 5                   
              year program each year.
