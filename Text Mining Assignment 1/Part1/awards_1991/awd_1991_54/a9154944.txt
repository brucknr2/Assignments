Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of California @ Los Angeles (UCLA) will initiate a              
              seven-week, commuter, Early Alert Initiative Young Scholars project            
              in Mathematics and Physics which will offer science enrichment                 
              activities for 40 minority precollege students entering grade 9.               
                                                                                             
              This program will emphasize research participation in analytic and             
              transformational geometry and applications in physics.  The project            
              is for minority students only and includes activities in a computer            
              mathematics laboratory using LOGO.  College advisement, dialogues              
              with engineering and science professionals, visitations to industry            
              sites and mentoring relationships will be used to promote the                  
              understanding of technical careers.  Sixteen Saturday Academies                
              during the academic year will sustain and reinforce these summer               
              efforts.
