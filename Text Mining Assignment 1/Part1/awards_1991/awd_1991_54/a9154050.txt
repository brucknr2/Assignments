              This Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) is a one-year                      
              Science Student Internship Program designed to provide five                    
              talented minority science and engineering students from a                      
              select group of colleges and universities with summer                          
              internship experiences at the National Science Foundation                      
              (NSF), and academic year follow-up activities at the

              the various agency programs, and gain some understanding of:                   
                                                                                             
              (a) how science policy is formulated, and how funding                          
              priorities are set;                                                            
                                                                                             
              (b) how the peer review process works;                                         
                                                                                             
              (c) how agencies receive, utilize, amend agency policies                       
              based on external advice; and                                                  
                                                                                             
              (d) how interns can increase and continue their own MSE
