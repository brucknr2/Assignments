Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support to continue offering summer                     
              institutes on the topics of molecular biology and biotechnology                
              for community college teachers.  The first of these was held in                
              the summer of 1990 under an NSF grant:  Undergraduate Faculty                  
              Enhancement Program.  Two more similar institutes are proposed                 
              to be offered in the summers of 1992 and 1993.  The workshops                  
              will be cosponsored by the community colleges of the State and                 
              the University of Illinois.  The objectives of the workshops                   
              are these:  1) to upgrade teachers' knowledge of molecular                     
              biology and biotechnology; 2) to provide hands-on laboratory                   
              experiences with the methods and techniques of molecular                       
              biology; 3) to encourage the formulation of a personal teaching                
              plan for including instruction in molecular biology and                        
              biotechnology at the participant's home institution, and 4) to                 
              form an active educational partnership between the state                       
              community college biology teachers and the University.  These                  
              teachers will establish a network for the purposes of sharing                  
              experiences and information and for continuing in-service                      
              education.
