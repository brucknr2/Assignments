Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Saint Vincent College will initiate a three-week, residential Young            
              Scholars project in Chemistry, Computer Science and Physics for 24             
              students entering grades 9 and 10.                                             
                                                                                             
              During the first week of the summer program all participants will              
              attend overview presentations and laboratory sessions on scientific            
              principles, research methodology and pertinent ethical issues in               
              the three disciplines.  Week 1 will also include a session on                  
              mathematics topics related to the science programs.  During Weeks              
              2 and 3 the students will divide into groups of eight; each small              
              group will work on intensive research projects over the two-week               
              period in environmental chemistry, digital logic and computer                  
              interfacing, or the physics of the electromagnetic spectrum.                   
              Findings from these research projects will be presented to the                 
              entire group of Young Scholars at the end of the summer program.               
              Career exploration for all participants will include field trips,              
              guest speakers, and use of the informational resources of the Saint            
              Vincent College Career Development Center.  An "Ethics in Science"             
              forum will be the capstone activity for study and discussion of                
              ethical issues surrounding the program's three disciplinary areas.
