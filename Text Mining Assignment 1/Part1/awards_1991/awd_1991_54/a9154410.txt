Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop instructional materials for                          
              incorporating the use of graphing calculators in algebra.  The                 
              lessons and "investigations" using graphing calculators will be                
              designed for direct use by the students and will include                       
              materials for the teachers to aid them in the use of materials.                
              there will be transitional materials developed that help the                   
              student make the leap from simple calculators to graphing                      
              calculators and provide an early introduction to experimentation               
              in mathematics.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The project personnel will provide inservice workshops for                     
              teachers, both during the year and in the summer.  These                       
              materials will be published in a monography by the Michigan                    
              Council of Teachers.//
