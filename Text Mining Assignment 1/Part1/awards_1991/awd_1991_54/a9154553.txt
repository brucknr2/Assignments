              Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose seeks National                         
              Science Foundation grant support in the amount of $381,000                     
              (55% of a total project cost of $693,188) to develop over a                    
              24-month period a series of interactive exhibits exploring                     
              the subject of rhythm, including both obvious and lesser                       
              known manifestations within the natural and physical worlds.                   
              Drawing upon the scientific disciplines of mathematics,                        
              biology, physics and psychology, RHYTHM takes as its                           
              construct the idea of time, the articulation of which means                    
              for apprehending and understanding rhythm.                                     
                                                                                             
              Working with outside advisors in science education and                         
              specific content areas, Co-PI Michael Oppenheimer will                         
              develop and build 20 exhibits, which will be semi-                             
              permanently installed at Children's Discovery Museum and                       
              accessible to our annual visitor population of 350,000;                        
              exhibits will also be profiled on "Kids" Clubhouse," a                         
              television program developed jointly by the Museum and our                     
              local PBS affiliate, KTEH/54, viewed by 55,000 weekly.                         
              Matching funds are also being requested to support                             
              curricular materials and a traveling version of RHYTHM.                        
              Over a 2-year, 8-site tour the Association of Science and                      
              Technology Centers projects that the series will reach a                       
              national audience of more than 1,000,000 children and                          
              adults.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              As a comprehensive project, RHYTHM provides a compelling                       
              model for addressing imperatives articulated in Science for                    
              All Americans, the landmark report issued by Project 2061 of

              Located in San Jose, California, the Museum serves an                          
              expanding urban area characterized by extraordinary ethnic                     
              diversity:  Santa Clara County's 1.5 million residents are                     
              42% non-Anglo, while San Jose is 50.8% Hispanic, Asian and
