Abstract    :
                   With the assistance of the not-for-profit organization,                   
              Ventures in Education, the District of Columbia Public Schools'                
              program for approximately 300 entering 10th graders from four (4)              
              participating high schools.  The program is viewed as a prototype              
              for urban school reform and the adoption process will be carefully             
              documented and evaluated by a panel appointed by the Office of                 
              Studies, Evaluation, and Dissemination at the National Science                 
              Foundation.                                                                    
                   The overall goal of the project is to orient school personnel             
              and students to a prototype program for urban school improvement               
              with emphasis on developing competence in science and mathematics.//
