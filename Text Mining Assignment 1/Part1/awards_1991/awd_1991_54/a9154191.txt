Abstract    :
              Two week workshops in chemical instrumentation for 36 two year                 
              college faculty provide the participants the opportunity to                    
              explore modern instrumental techniques and their applications                  
              in introductory courses. One week is spent on each of two                      
              instrument groups selected by the participant. Options include:                
              atomic absorption and flame emission, fourier-transform                        
              infrared spectroscopy, vapor phase chromatography, high                        
              performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance                  
              spectroscopy, gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, and                        
              computerized data acquisition.Date: Summers 1992 and
