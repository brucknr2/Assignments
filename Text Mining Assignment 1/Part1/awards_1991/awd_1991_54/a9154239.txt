Abstract    :
              Three two-week workshops will be held to acquaint undergraduate                
              professors with new curricula ideas and applications in the                    
              areas of mathematical modeling, geometry, and statistics.                      
              Leaders in each field, both academic and practitioners, will                   
              interact with seventy-five nationally drawn participants to                    
              enable them to understand new developments in these                            
              mathematical fields and to prepare applications-based modular                  
              materials suitable for classroom use.  Areas to be discussed                   
              are problem-solving strategies using combinatorics and graph                   
              theory, applications of analysis to biology, and graphical                     
              algorithms in the social sciences. In geometry, emphasis will                  
              center on tilings, combinatorial geometry, and studies in                      
              computational geometry.  Statistics will focus on data analysis                
              and graphical techniques as applied to experimental design,                    
              quality control, and sociology.
