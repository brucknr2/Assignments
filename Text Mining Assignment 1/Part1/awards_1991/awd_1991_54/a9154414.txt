Abstract    :
              Reports of increasing rates of ozone depletion and                             
              predictions of the resulting increased levels of                               
              ultraviolet-B radiation at the earth's surface have been                       
              documented.  Plant scientists have investigated the                            
              effects of increasing UV-B radiation on crop plants, but                       
              the responses in native plants in natural ecosystems                           
              are largely unknown.  Meaningful studies of the effects                        
              of increasing UV-B radiation on native plants should                           
              include the stresses associated with their natural                             
              environments.  Although coastal salt marshes are highly                        
              productive, the very low plant diversity together with                         
              high salt concentrations create habitats which are not                         
              very resilient to disturbances.  The data for crop plants                      
              indicate wide variation in plant responses, suggesting                         
              possible selective effects that could be very damaging to                      
              the delicate balances present in natural communities.                          
              The purpose of this study id to examine the interactive                        
              effects of increasing UV-B radiation and salt stress in                        
              holophytic plants of coastal salt marshes.  Specific                           
              objectives include investigations of whether increasing                        
              UV-B radiation results in selective effects on species                         
              composition and whether these plants, which are normally                       
              exposed to high light intensities, develop protective                          
              mechanisms against higher levels of UV-B radiation.
