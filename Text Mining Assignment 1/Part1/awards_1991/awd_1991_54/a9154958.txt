Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Southern California will initiate an academic                
              year, commuter, multidisciplinary Young scholars project which will            
              offer science enrichment activities for 50 precollege students                 
              entering grades 10-12.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This program individually places participants under the supervision            
              of professional scientists in the Southern California region.                  
              Student researchers are placed at colleges, universities,                      
              government laboratories, museums or industrial laboratories which              
              are close to their homes.  Their research takes place over a period            
              of eight months and culminates with an oral presentation of the                
              results at the annual meeting of the Southern California Academy of            
              Sciences.  The program also includes a series of Saturday meetings             
              at colleges or universities for the purpose of exploring                       
              opportunities for scientific careers, the conduct of research,                 
              ethics in science, and the techniques for writing and presenting               
              research papers.
