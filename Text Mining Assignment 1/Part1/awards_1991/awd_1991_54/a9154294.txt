Abstract    :
              Ten one day workshops will be presented to promote the                         
              immediate and widespread use of graphing calculators into the                  
              undergraduate mathematics curriculum.  This project will                       
              provide 250 undergraduate math faculty with (1) detailed                       
              training on the mechanics of the calculator, (2) ideas as to                   
              how the calculator can be used in specific courses, (3) the                    
              opportunity to develop instructional materials for those                       
              courses, and (4) the opportunity to share their experiences                    
              with colleagues.  The four member project team will visit 10                   
              community college campuses to give these workshops to                          
              interested two- and four-year college mathematics faculty.                     
              Each participant will receive a TI-81 graphing calculator and                  
              each institution a calculator projector kit to encourage                       
              instructors to continually explore potential uses of graphing                  
              calculators in mathematics instruction.  The project director                  
              will create, edit, and publish a newsletter, and three follow-                 
              up meetings are scheduled so that participating faculty can                    
              share their experiences.
