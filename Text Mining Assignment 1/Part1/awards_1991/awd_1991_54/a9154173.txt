Abstract    :
              Participants are being recruited who share a common interest in                
              exploring various areas of combinatories and discrete                          
              mathematics as they are applied to a variety of topics, many of                
              which have direct applicability to the undergraduate                           
              curriculum.  The objective of this conference is to cover                      
              selected fundamental topics from contemporary                                  
              combinatories/discrete mathematics, with the goal of                           
              modernizing undergraduate courses related to these areas.  To                  
              this end, emphasis will be on basic new theoretical results and                
              their uses, as well as fundamental combinatorial/discrete                      
              mathematics concepts and problem solving techniques.  The                      
              application of these topics to areas other than mathematics                    
              will also be discussed.  The mornings will be devoted to                       
              lectures by the main speakers and afternoons to group                          
              discussions, problem solving sessions, participant talks,                      
              classroom application/incorporation/improvements, and the use                  
              of computer facilities.  The participants will be required to                  
              submit a report indicating how the ideas of this conference                    
              were incorporated into or affected the content of their                        
              courses; the teaching of their courses; their mathematical                     
              activity and awareness; and, where applicable, their research                  
              during the 1992-93 school year.
