Abstract    :
              This project gives 40 participants from the southwestern section of            
              the country intensive exposure to personal productivity and                    
              teaching enhancement software applicable to undergraduate physics              
              courses.  The workshop is conducted by experts from New Mexico                 
              State University, which has a program to introduce more computer               
              usage to its undergraduate curriculum.  The participants are                   
              selected from two and four year colleges from the region with                  
              preference given to those from institutions serving significant                
              numbers of Hispanic and Native American students.  During the week             
              the participants listen to experts discuss and demonstrate the                 
              capabilities of various computer programs.  In the afternoons, the             
              participants actually use the software to create applications for              
              their own courses.  A newsletter produced from the applications                
              created by the participants insures that good ideas are given wide             
              distribution.  The objective of the workshop is to introduce a                 
              significant number of undergraduate faculty to the capabilities and            
              operation of various computer programs which can enhance the                   
              teaching of their courses.
