Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of video images will be produced that can be used                     
              in a variety of formats to enhance student-teacher and                         
              student-subject matter interactions in chemistry education.                    
              The video, which extends the range of video images shown on                    
              the Periodic Table Videodisc produced by the same                              
              developers, will show primarily chemicals, their reactions                     
              and their practical applications.  These videodiscs will                       
              allow a great deal of descriptive chemistry to be introduced                   
              into beginning courses in an interesting way.  In addition,                    
              some hard-to-visualize theoretical constructs of chemistry                     
              will be included.  Historically important people, artifacts,                   
              experiments and documents will be shown including the                          
              contributions of those from groups underrepresented in                         
              chemistry.  The completed images will be distributed,                          
              probably on videodisc, through Journal of Chemical                             
              Education:  Software and will also be available for future                     
              publication in other formats.  Example lessons based on the                    
              published videodiscs in both computer-interactive and stand                    
              alone modes will be provided.  The materials will be                           
              suitable for use in grades 8-12 and also in introductory                       
              courses in two and four year colleges.
