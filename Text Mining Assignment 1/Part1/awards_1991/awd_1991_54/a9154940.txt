Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Georgia State University will initiate an eight-week, summer               
              commuter, Young Scholars project in Chemistry with other                       
              interdisciplinary science components for 22 students entering                  
              grades 11 and 12.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Each student will experience hands-on usage of a wide variety of               
              modern laboratory instruments and equipment while working on three             
              individual, relevant projects of decreasing structure.  The first              
              project involves recycling inorganic industrial wastes into useful             
              high-temperature superconductor materials.  The second project is              
              a study of techniques to separate and identify organic compounds               
              such as those which occur in natural fruit flavorings and perfumery            
              oils.  The group will choose a third mini-research project from                
              three options offered including  (a) a project to test new mixed               
              ligand extraction agent systems for ability to separate and recover            
              various toxic or vital metals from water solutions such as                     
              wastewater effluents,  (b) using a recently synthesized organic                
              color reagent to develop a spectrophotometric method for analysis              
              of trace amounts of heavy metals in environmental samples, or                  
              (c) performing a wide variety of analyses to assess the quality of             
              individual water or soil samples taken from the environment.  The              
              last four weeks of the project will find each student working about            
              four hours per day in the laboratory of a research professor in one            
              of the following science departments:  chemistry, biology, physics             
              or geology.
