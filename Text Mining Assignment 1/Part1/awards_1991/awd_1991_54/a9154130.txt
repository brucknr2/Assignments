Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A partnership made up of CSY, Inc. and the Science and                         
              Engineering Alliance has been created to develop a multi-                      
              media based Minorities in Science Series for K-6.  The                         
              product is designed to provide a solid foundation for                          
              understanding scientific and technological concepts and how                    
              they relate to a student's personal and social context.  The                   
              principle aim of this project is to create courseware that                     
              is developed in an environment that will provide technology                    
              based pedagogical strategies that increase minority                            
              achievement, stress minority role models and bring an                          
              overall sense of pride and ownership to the learning process                   
              on the part of minority students.  The project will produce                    
              two sides of video disc -- one for K-3 and the other for 4-                    
              6.
