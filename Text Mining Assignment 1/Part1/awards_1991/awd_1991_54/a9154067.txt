Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Vanderbilt University seeks funds to develop and field-test                    
              new applications of videodisc and hypermedia technology for                    
              use in educating preservice teachers of elementary school                      
              mathematics.  The project will build upon and extend work                      
              supported by NSF.  The proposed areas of development include                   
              hypermedia cases, library materials, research environments,                    
              and prototype assessment materials. The materials will be                      
              tested at Vanderbilt and eleven institutions of higher                         
              education in Alabama which are already structured into a                       
              consortium for the project Validating the Use of Hypermedia in                 
              Elementary Mathematics Education, supported under the NSF                      
              project TPE-9053826.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing by Vanderbilt University is 11% of the total cost                 
              requested from NSF.
