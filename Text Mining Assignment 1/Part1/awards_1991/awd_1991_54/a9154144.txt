Abstract    :
              The workshop concentrates on the integration of several                        
              scientific computation software systems into the teaching of                   
              mathematics courses offered in the first two years of college.                 
              The workshop will be followed by a weekend mini conference in                  
              February, 1993. This project aims to upgrade the mathematical                  
              and computing expertise of faculty in California Community                     
              Colleges. Three high level computational packages (Mathematica,                
              Maple, and MATLAB) will be used in the project.
