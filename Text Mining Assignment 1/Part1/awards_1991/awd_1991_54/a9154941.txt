Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Arizona State University will initiate a four-week, commuter               
              and residential, Early Alert Initiative Young Scholars project in              
              Mathematics which will offer enrichment activities for 60                      
              precollege students entering grade 8.                                          
                                                                                             
              The first two weeks of the program will take place on the Navajo               
              Reservation.  Participants will be introduced to the experimental              
              nature of mathematics.  The topics of number theory, discrete                  
              probability, graph theory, and combinatorics will be taught and                
              used as experimental material.  The students will learn to write               
              computer programs to implement mathematical routines for use in                
              checking conjectures.  Participants also will learn problem-solving            
              techniques.  Problems will be selected and collected from several              
              sources including the Hungarian publication, "Matematika Lapok."               
              Various science activities will be correlated with the mathematical            
              focus.  For example, participants will learn about the mathematics             
              of lenses and will build a four-inch reflector telescope which will            
              then be used to explore the beautiful night sky above the Navajo               
              Reservation.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Students will spend the last two weeks on the campus of the Arizona            
              State University, where they will be given the opportunity to meet             
              with science faculty members and to attend science demonstrations.             
              They also will meet with personnel from the admissions and                     
              financial aid offices.
