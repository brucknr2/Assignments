Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Busch Campus, will                
              initiate a four-week, residential Young Scholars project in                    
              Mathematics which will provide enrichment activities for 40                    
              students entering grades 10-12.                                                
                                                                                             
              This program will emphasize research participation in discrete                 
              mathematics.  The project will increase students' problem-solving              
              abilities and expose them to a wide variety of mathematical                    
              scientists as role models.  Topics such as mathematical induction,             
              logic and truth tables, recursion relations, and strategies for                
              making proofs will be covered.  Participants will focus on                     
              applications of graphs, algorithms in graph theory, mathematical               
              formulations of fairness, iteration and fractals, and applications.
