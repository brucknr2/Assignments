Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop innovative test questions,                           
              statewide examinations and teacher resources to help ensure                    
              that specific science learning outcomes are achieved; this                     
              for grades four and eight and for high school earth science                    
              and biology.  Science assessment manuals will be developed                     
              to assist teachers in preparing students for more                              
              challenging state examinations and to encourage more                           
              thoughtful student evaluation.  Wide dissemination of the                      
              results of this activity are planned.
