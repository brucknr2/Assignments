Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to carry out exploratory research on                          
              "real-world" problem situations.  First the resign of such a                   
              problem will be undertaken by a consortium that consists of                    
              faculty from a research university, members from a national                    
              laboratory, and members of an institute for research on                        
              learning together with middle school teachers.  The research                   
              will address how does working on such problems link up with                    
              the practice of symbolic skills; connect to mathematical                       
              idealizations, e.g. how should the students understanding of                   
              linear functions be introduced and emphasized; require                         
              additional understanding in subject matter and pedagogy for                    
              the teacher.  Also the questions of assessment of students                     
              will be studied.  A project report of the research findings                    
              will be made available for other developers of this type of                    
              materials.
