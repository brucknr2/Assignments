Abstract    :
                   This work will permit preliminary planning activities prior               
              to submitting a full research proposal. The work integrates                    
              population ecology into a larger research framework that                       
              examinesthe impact of human land use on biodiversity in                        
              agroecosystems.  The specific planning objectives are 1) to                    
              develop a better understanding of landscape ecology and ecosystem              
              concepts as applied to agroecosystems, 2) learn new analytical                 
              and technical skills to facilitate the work, and 3) expand                     
              detailed knowledge of the biology and land-use history of the                  
              study site.
