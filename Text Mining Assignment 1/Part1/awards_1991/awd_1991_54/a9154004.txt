Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a proposal by the Mathematical Association of                     
              America for a conference to discuss the issues involved in                     
              improving the education in mathematics for undergraduates in                   
              colleges and universities.  Among the issues to be                             
              considered are:                                                                
                                                                                             
              i) effective ways to communicate to college and university                     
              faculty the growing body research in undergraduate                             
              mathematics education.                                                         
              ii) effective ways to stimulate the college and university                     
              environment so that the research findings in i) may be                         
              implemented in classrooms.                                                     
              iii) effective ways for faculty who undertake research in                      
              teaching and learning to find support and encouragement.                       
                                                                                             
              The results of the conference will be a long range strategic                   
              plan that will be published as a Conference Report by the                      
              MAA.  The report will be distributed to the chairs of all                      
              mathematical science departments.  Furthermore, articles                       
              which summarize the conference will appear in both FOCUS                       
              and UME Trends.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Representatives from the various mathematical societies,                       
              American Mathematical Society, Mathematical Association of                     
              America and National Council of Teachers of Mathematics will                   
              participate in the conference.  Prior to the conference,                       
              background information on the issues will be collected by                      
              the staff of the MAA.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The conference will be held in the FAll in Washington, DC.
