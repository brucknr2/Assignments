Abstract    :
              A five-day workshop on recent developments in algorithmic                      
              number theory will be conducted for 35 college and university                  
              faculty. The workshop will introduce participants to topics                    
              that can be used to enhance undergraduate courses in number                    
              theory, algebra, and the theory of computation. It will include                
              ten one-hour expository lectures by Eric Bach, computer                        
              assignments on the topic, and discussions among participants                   
              about inclusion of these topics in their classes.  The lectures                
              will discuss classical algorithms in number theory, algorithms                 
              for finite fields, and methods for primality testing,                          
              factoring, and discrete logarithms.  Besides their intrinsic                   
              interest to number theorists, these algorithms are useful in                   
              cryptography, pseudo-random number generation, and computer                    
              algebra.  Other applications will also be discussed.
