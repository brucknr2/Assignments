Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The City College of the City University of New York will initiate              
              an eight-week, commuter Young Scholars project in Chemistry and the            
              Life Sciences (biology, biochemistry, chemistry and biophysics) for            
              20 students entering grade 12.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Each student will participate in a summer research experience, as              
              part of a modern research team, with his/her own problem integrated            
              into the larger disciplinary focus of the group.                               
                                                                                             
              The research activity will be in tandem with a strong program of               
              discussions and seminars whose purpose is to ease the student's                
              transition to college and to encourage the participants to pursue              
              a science major and a career in science.  Following the summer                 
              experience the students will be invited to continue their work at              
              City College during the academic year.
