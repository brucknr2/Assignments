Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is proposal for funding of a project to examine the                       
              integration of telecommunications technologies into the science                
              and mathematics educational reform process. We propose to address              
              a particular educational goal or strategy in order to examine the              
              process of translating a strategy into practice through the lens               
              of telecommunications. Through commissioned papers and seminar                 
              discussions in roundtable format among visionaries, experts                    
              critics, educators, and other participants in the educational                  
              process, the project would produce guidelines and                              
              recommendations, for both the National Science Foundation and                  
              other key leaders and organizations, of necessary actions in                   
              linking online learning to the science and mathematics                         
              educational reform process.
