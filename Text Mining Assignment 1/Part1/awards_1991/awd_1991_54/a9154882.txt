Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              McNeese State University will initiate a three-week, residential               
              Young Scholars project in Engineering for 20 students entering                 
              grades 10-12; the project will be repeated each year for a second              
              set of 20 students.  The program will take place in June and July              
              at McNeese State University and at the U.S. Army Engineer Waterway             
              Experiment Station in Vicksburg, Mississippi.                                  
                                                                                             
              At Vicksburg, a three-day coastal engineering workshop will                    
              introduce students to the theory and practice of coastal                       
              engineering.  At McNeese, studies will consist of field work,                  
              physical modeling and classroom instruction with field work taking             
              place at two beaches on the Gulf Coast, where students will survey             
              and measure beach profiles.  On campus, students will design, build            
              and test models of coastal protection systems in a large wave tank.            
              A physics laboratory course will reinforce concepts of velocity and            
              acceleration, densities of materials and behavior of waves.                    
              Classroom instruction will be given in coastal engineering, coastal            
              geology, computer applications, ethics of engineering, career                  
              counseling and technical writing.
