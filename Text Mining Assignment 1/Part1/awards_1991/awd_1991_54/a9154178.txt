Abstract    :
              The Chautauqua Program is providing an annual series of                        
              workshops in which scholars at the frontiers of various                        
              sciences and engineering meet for several days with                            
              undergraduate college science and engineering faculty.  These                  
              workshops are providing an opportunity for invited scholars to                 
              communicate new knowledge, concepts, and techniques directly to                
              college faculty in ways which are immediately beneficial to                    
              their teaching.  The primary aim is to enable undergraduate                    
              faculty in the sciences and engineering to keep their teaching                 
              current and relevant.Date:Contact: Nicholas G. Eror, Dept. of
