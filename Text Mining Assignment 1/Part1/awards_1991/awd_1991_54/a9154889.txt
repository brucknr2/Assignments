Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Maryland, Baltimore County, will initiate a six-             
              week, residential, multidisciplinary Young Scholars project in                 
              Biology, Chemistry and Physics which will offer science enrichment             
              activities to 40 students entering grade 9.                                    
                                                                                             
              The talented participants (principally drawn from inner-city                   
              Baltimore) in the Horizons Exploration Program (HEP) will acquire              
              knowledge, develop skills, learn about educational opportunities               
              and gain insights into a variety of careers in these disciplines.              
              This work will be augmented by instruction in mathematics, computer            
              science and technical reading and writing.  Although the goals of              
              the program will be achieved through the three themes of biology,              
              chemistry and physics, strong emphasis will be placed on biology as            
              the major discipline; this is the first science class that most                
              ninth graders face as they enter the city high schools.
