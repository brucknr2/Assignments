Abstract    :
              A five-day workshop for 30 faculty members drawn from                          
              engineering, science, and mathematics, will focus on using                     
              computer algebra as an effective tool in teaching, revising                    
              curricula, and making the contents of their courses more                       
              conceptual.  In the interdisciplinary atmosphere of the                        
              workshop, participants will conceive and create units suitable                 
              for incorporation into the undergraduate curriculum. Dates:
