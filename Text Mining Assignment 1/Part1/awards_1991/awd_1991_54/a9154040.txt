Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Mathematical Association of America seeks funding for a                    
              one year project which is aimed at investigating the state of                  
              teacher preparation with regard to minority populations.  The                  
              project has three major facets:                                                
              i.  A study which will be conducted with data collected                        
              throughout the nation to inform the mathematics community                      
              about minorities going into the teaching of mathematics at                     
              the secondary level.                                                           
              ii.   A working conference which will bring a small group of                   
              experts together to address different components of the                        
              problems and to present papers which feature model programs                    
              for minority preservice education.  Papers will be revised                     
              after the conference, and submitted to MAA committees and to                   
              members of a select panel.                                                     
              iii.  This Blue Ribbon panel of distinguished educators and                    
              leaders in various related areas will hold a conference,                       
              together with all other project participants, and will react                   
              to the papers and the results of the study.                                    
              The end-product of the MAA effort will be a document which                     
              includes the study and the papers produced by the project                      
              participants.  The document will be disseminated to the MAA                    
              membership.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              MAA cost sharing of approximately 3% of the requested amount                   
              is shown by their reduction of the indirect cost rate from                     
              34% to 30%.                                                                    
              The funds awarded to this project is the revised amount,                       
              $91,362.
