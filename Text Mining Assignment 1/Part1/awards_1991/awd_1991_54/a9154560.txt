Abstract    :
              This project provides the opportunity for up to 20 groups of                   
              undergraduate students a year to visit the University of                       
              North Texas Accelerator Laboratory to perform nuclear physics                  
              experiments.  These groups would come primarily from colleges                  
              and universities within a day's drive from the laboratory.  A                  
              2.7 MeV Van de Graaf accelerator is being upgraded with a                      
              scattering chamber reserved for student use.  In addition,                     
              the accompanying faculty will have experience and contacts                     
              that can strengthen nuclear physics programs at the home                       
              institutions.  Results and the description of experiments                      
              will be published in the appropriate places.
