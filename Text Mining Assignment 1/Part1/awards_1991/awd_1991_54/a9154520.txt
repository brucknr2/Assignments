Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The American Association of State Colleges and Universities has                
              requested a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) for a 10-              
              month research project to examine three issues which appear                    
              relevant to affecting mid-career moves into science and                        
              mathematics education.  (1)  The attitudes of program                          
              participants and school personnel about each other and how have                
              those attitudes changed through participation in the nontradition              
              or mid-career program.  (2)  The organizational changes sustained              
              in the process of establishing a nontraditional or mid-career                  
              program.  (3)  How the supply pressures and the development of                 
              responsive program affected the larger political and social                    
              context in which policies and processes for teacher training are               
              established.  Outcomes of this study will include: (a) a set of                
              case studies describing the programs both qualitatively; (b)                   
              guidelines to support the relationship between the private sector              
              and education; (c) an annotated guide to resources and programs.               
              The private sector partner in this project will be Digital                     
              Equipment Corporation which will not only provide hardware and                 
              software but also professional staff expertise in research                     
              design, analysis, and reporting.
