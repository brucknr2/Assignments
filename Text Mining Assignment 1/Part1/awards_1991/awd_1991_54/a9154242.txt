Abstract    :
              This regional workshop for faculty from small four-year                        
              colleges in New York and New England focuses on advanced NMR                   
              techniques and the introducion of this topic into undergraduate                
              teaching programs.  The formal instruction and hands-on                        
              instrument use includes such topics as Fourier transform                       
              techniques, relaxation measurements, C-13 multiple pulse                       
              techniques, solvent suppression, two dimensional NMR, NMR of                   
              solids, and integration of NMR techniques into course work.                    
              There will be an opportunity for five participants to join host                
              institution's faculty in various research projects for an                      
              additional six weeks.  Participants will be able to return                     
              during the academic year with their students for undergraduate                 
              oriented weekend NMR workshops.
