Abstract    :
              Science and technology faculty members from some of the                        
              Virginia Community Colleges will form small interdisciplinary                  
              Learning Groups with science faculty from James Madison                        
              University to work on team-oriented projects. Each project                     
              group will consist of three or four participants and a Group                   
              Leader.  The emphasis will be on learning particular methods,                  
              techniques, and/or instrumentation use which can be utilized in                
              undergraduate classes.  Particular areas include: Protein                      
              Purification, DNA Probes, Elemental, Ion, and Crystalline                      
              Analysis, Polycrystalline Fabrics, Microprocessing Programming,                
              and Plant Tissue and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Development                 
              of Instructional Materials using both case studies and                         
              computer-driven courseware authoring have been built into the                  
              program.  Priority will be given to faculty from the Virginia                  
              Valley Consortium. but others will be considered on a space                    
              available basis.
