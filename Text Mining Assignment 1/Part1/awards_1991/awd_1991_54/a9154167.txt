Abstract    :
              This workshop is designed for undergraduate college faculty who                
              teach courses in historical geology, paleontology, petrology,                  
              or related fields, and who have had little or no experience in                 
              modern carbonates.  Its purpose is to expand the participant's                 
              understanding of modern carbonate sediments, precursors of                     
              ancient limestones, and post-depositional changes that effect                  
              them.  Specific topics to be examined include carbonate-                       
              secreting organisms, sediments, environments of deposition,                    
              carbonate digenesis, soil formation and interpretation of                      
              Pleistocene deposits.  The program involves daily field work,                  
              labs and lectures and will be held at the Bahamian Field                       
              Station, San Salvador, Bahamas.  Laboratory exercises, which                   
              can be conducted at the participants home institutions, will                   
              utilize samples collected on daily field trips.  A guidebook,                  
              approximately 100 pages in length, will be prepared and                        
              provided for each participant.
