Abstract    :
              The Discussion group brought together national leaders from the                
              sciences and the humanities for a one day meeting to discuss                   
              general education in the nation's colleges and universities.                   
              Included in the charge was the more specific question of what                  
              role the federal agencies could best play in improving the                     
              general education of all students. The participants strongly                   
              encouraged the agencies to continue their joint work in this                   
              area.
