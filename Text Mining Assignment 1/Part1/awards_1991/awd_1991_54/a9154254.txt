Abstract    :
              This regional consortium of two- and four-year colleges will                   
              conduct a week-long professional development seminar for                       
              college mathematics teachers in the East Tennessee area during                 
              the summer of 1992 followed by three week-end seminars in the                  
              1992-93 academic year.  The seminars are laboratory-based and                  
              are  designed to introduce participants to discrete dynamical                  
              analysis, provide them with extensive opportunities on the use                 
              of calculators and computers for exploration and problem                       
              solving, and lead them to a continued interest in collaborative                
              research and professional development. In addition, these                      
              seminars will  provide opportunity and stimulation for                         
              cooperative development of new curricular materials and                        
              instructional techniques for the use of calculators and                        
              computers in the teaching of mathematics in post-secondary                     
              classes from the beginning levels through calculus.
