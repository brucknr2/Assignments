Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project investigates educators' understanding of                          
              concepts involved in applying telecommunications networks to                   
              educational purposes.  The investigators will develop a                        
              prototype series of videotaped information on the NSFNET,                      
              Internet and NREN.  Telecommunications is a dynamic and                        
              procedural subject.  To understand the networks, educators                     
              need to see demonstrations of network applications and                         
              animated sequences that illustrate data/message exchange and                   
              transmission across systems.  The content will include basic                   
              concepts of networking, how networks are used in education,                    
              characteristics of NSFNET/Internet, and how to use the                         
              NSFNET.  An experimental feature of the video series will be                   
              a scenario-based viewers assessment.  Viewers will be asked                    
              to assess their level of understanding after viewing the                       
              video; sequences.  This information will be used to identify                   
              requirements for more extensive educational materials on                       
              this subject for educators.
