Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This 1 1/2 hour documentary film portrays the famous                      
              anthropologist's life history, her work, and her audience                      
              against the background of 20th century American history.                       
              The proposed work, a blend of never-before-seen archival                       
              footage and stills, on-location footage, live interviews,                      
              and three newly created impressionistic vignettes, is                          
              intended for general and scholarly audiences.  It is based                     
              completely upon original historical research.
