Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This project is designed to reach rural middle school and high                 
              school science teachers in Colorado through the use of a                       
              mobile science show followed by an intensive summer workshop                   
              and networking activities.  The Mobile Science Show will bring                 
              workshops and demonstrations to more than four hundred (400)                   
              rural teachers, from which fifty (50) will be selected to                      
              attend the two-week summer workshop.  The fifty teachers will                  
              form the core of a network for the future sharing and                          
              dissemination of materials and ideas.
