Abstract    :
                   This project is involved with the analysis of stochastic                  
              and dynamic vehicle routing problems that arise in                             
              transportation, communication, and manufacturing systems.  It is               
              also involved with developing new algorithms for performance                   
              analysis and optimization of queueing networks.  Finally, it is                
              involved with worst case analysis of combinatorial optimization                
              problems.                                                                      
                   Breakthroughs in any of these problem areas will prove                    
              valuable in the development of advanced analysis techniques.
