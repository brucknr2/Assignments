Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a five year program to study                      
              the Cenozoic glacial and climatic history of the Antarctic                     
              region.  The objectives are to: (1) identify marine biogenic                   
              paleoproductivity events in former Antarctic                                   
              seas/embayments; (2) determine hidden stratigraphy in                          
              subglacial basins through study of recycled (ice-                              
              transported) microfossils; (3) enhance the utility of                          
              diatoms as tools for paleoenvironmental interpretation                         
              (sea-level changes, sea-ice cover, paleotemperatures, etc.)                    
              and age dating; (4) provide stratigraphic records from                         
              Antarctica to direct and limit interpretations from                            
              deep-sea data.   This award is under the Presidential Young                    
              Investigator (PYI) program.
