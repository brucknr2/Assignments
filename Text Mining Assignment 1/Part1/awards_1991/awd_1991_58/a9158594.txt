Abstract    :
              The proposed research involves the derivation of constraints upon              
              the structure, composition, and thermal regime of the Earth's                  
              interior by simultaneous consideration of thermodynamic,                       
              thermoelastic, mineralogical, and seismological data.  In                      
              particular: constraint of lower crustal compositions, compositional            
              differences between upper and lower mantle, anomalous compositional            
              and thermal characteristics at the core-mantle boundary.
