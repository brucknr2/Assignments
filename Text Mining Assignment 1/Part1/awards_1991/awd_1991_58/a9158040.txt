Abstract    :
              The fundamental understanding of wave scattering by                            
              random rough surface is important in a variety of                              
              engineering and scientific applications.  In radio                             
              oceanography, for example, radar returns from the                              
              sea surface are used to probe ocean wave                                       
              characteristics. In solid state physics, the theory                            
              ofrough surface scattering is used to study quantum                            
              scattering of atoms from crystal surfaces.  Monte                              
              Carlo simulations of random rough surfaces are                                 
              customarily done with the integral equation and the                            
              extended boundary condition methods.  We                                       
              haverecently applied the partial differential equation                         
              techniques of finite differences and finite elements in                        
              the frequency domain to the problem of one-                                    
              dimensional rough surface scattering.  The                                     
              attractiveness of these methods is the banded nature                           
              of the resulting matrix equation.  On the other hand,                          
              when these techniques are applied in the time                                  
              domain, the need of inverting large matrices can be                            
              eliminated.  In this project, frequency- and time-                             
              domain finite difference and finite element                                    
              techniques will be developed for the statistical                               
              analysis of 1-D and 2-D random rough surfaces.                                 
              Parallel computation algorithms using these                                    
              techniques and the inverse problem of determining                              
              the surface statistics from the scattering responses                           
              using neural network techniques will also be                                   
              investigated.
