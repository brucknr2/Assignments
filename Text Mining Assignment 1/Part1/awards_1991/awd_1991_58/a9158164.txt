Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to examine the dynamics and flow                  
              behavior of Polymeric Liquid Crystals (PLCs) in terms of the                   
              underlying polymer and domain microstructure.  PLCs are highly                 
              ordered polymer solutions and melts with useful anisotropic                    
              optical and mechanical properties strongly influenced by                       
              processing.  This coupling between flow processing and the                     
              microstructure, which itself determines the final mechanical                   
              and optical properties, is to be elucidated and quantified.                    
              To better understand the relationships between the                             
              nonequilibrium microstructure and the macroscopic rheology in                  
              transient flows, three techniques will be used to examine and                  
              model the behavior of these complex fluids:  (a)  Rheometry;                   
              (b) Dichroism and birefringence; (c) Nonequilibrium molecular                  
              dynamic simulations on massive parallel computers, to model                    
              and understand the experiments.                                                
                                                                                             
              The dynamical behavior of PLC systems under transient flow is                  
              of interest in most PLC product fabrication processes.
