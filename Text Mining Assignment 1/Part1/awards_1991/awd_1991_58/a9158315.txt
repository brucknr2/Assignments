Abstract    :
              In this Presidential Young Investigator award, modern synthetic                
              organic and organometallic reactions will be used for the synthesis            
              of new conjugated organic oligomers and polymers.  The molecular               
              architectures are planned so as to maximize the electronic                     
              (conducting) and photonic (nonlinear optical) properties of the                
              final materials.  For example, planar polyphenylene derivatives                
              will be synthesized by metal-catalyzed cross coupling reactions.               
              Reactive sites within each monomer unit will then unite to force               
              the final target polymer into a planar conformation.  This should              
              minimize the electrical resistance in conductivity studies as well             
              as minimize the photonic loss in third order nonlinear optical                 
              studies.  Additional studies will involve the synthesis of chiral              
              and optically active conjugated polymers that are asymmetric along             
              their backbone due to restricted rotations around single bonds.
