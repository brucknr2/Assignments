Abstract    :
              This is a PYI proposal.  The PI's research will be in                          
              three related areas.  One area is the mathematical                             
              theory of electromechanical systems.  The second area                          
              will focus on modeling of switchmode power converters.                         
              The third area will be in the optimal design of                                
              double-salient machines.
