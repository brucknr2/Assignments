Abstract    :
                   This research focuses on reducing time and cost taken to                  
              convert a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) design into an                   
              operational system.  Software for FMS control has been often                   
              identified as the main contributing factor to lack of flexibility,             
              and high cost of implementation.  Specific topics to be addressed              
              during the first year include; understanding the implications of               
              the control architecture on the elements of control (planning,                 
              scheduling and control), development of a systems theoretic model              
              of FMS control, and identifying generic and specific elements in               
              the system models.                                                             
                   The objectives of the research are to develop a generic,                  
              product independent methodology and tools for the design and                   
              development of FMS control software.  The methodology should                   
              provide for the rapid prototyping, evaluation, and subsequent                  
              implementation in a computer-integrated manufacturing system.
