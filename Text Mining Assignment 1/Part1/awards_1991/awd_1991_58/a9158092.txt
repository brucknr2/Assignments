Abstract    :
                   This Presidential Young Investigator Award will enhance                   
              support for Randall L. Dougherty's research in several areas of                
              set theory and computing:  the structure of Borel equivalence                  
              relations; elementary embeddings from the set of sets below a                  
              given rank to itself; Fourier coefficients of measures on the                  
              Cantor set; Borel versions of standard algebraic results; graph                
              algorithms for the Human Genome Program.                                       
                   These topics range from fundamental questions about the set               
              theoretic foundations of mathematics to highly practical                       
              applications to algorithms concerned with DNA.  The common thread              
              is sophisticated combinatorics, whether infinite or finite.
