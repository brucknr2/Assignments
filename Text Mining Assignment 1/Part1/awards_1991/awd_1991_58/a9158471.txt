Abstract    :
                   The investigator proposes a mix of activities aimed at a                  
              study of decays of heavy b and c quarks.  The activities                       
              include participation in the design of a detector to be used                   
              at an asymmetric B factory at SLAC, and in the running and                     
              analysis of data from experiment E791 at Fermilab.  In the                     
              former activity, the PI already has established her program.                   
              She has given a course of seminars at SLAC on the subject of                   
              CP violation - the matter/antimatter asymmetry of the                          
              universe.  She has also co-led the study of the use of He                      
              based drift chamber gases in a detector to be used at the                      
              planned facility.  She also plans a long term participation in                 
              E791 at Fermilab to study semi-leptonic decays of D mesons,                    
              and also mixing between the matter/antimatter D0 and anti-D0                   
              partners.
