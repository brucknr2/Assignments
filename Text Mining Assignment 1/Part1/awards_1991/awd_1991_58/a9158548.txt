Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Presidential Young Investigator award will enable the                     
              investigator to pursue an integrated program of research on the                
              production and perception of speech, including the development of              
              these capacities in children acquiring their native language.                  
                                                                                             
              The investigator has developed a model of speech production which              
              has become extremely influential in the field.  He has identified              
              a number of shortcoming in the model, particularly with respect                
              to questions of the timing of speech.  He is now exploring a new               
              family of algorithm which show promise for a better treatment of               
              the timing issues, and which also appear to relate interestingly               
              to phenomena of speech perception.  During the ensuing grant                   
              period, he will pursue this theoretical development in depth,                  
              with particular reference to the problem of modeling inter-work                
              phenomena.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The research plans also include further theoretical and empirical              
              work on the problem of speech acquisition.  There is a                         
              fundamental question of acquisition related to the problem of how              
              it is an infant can learn to perform the complex motor activities              
              of speech based on the acoustic data the child receives as a                   
              model.  The investigator has developed a hypothesis that speech                
              acquisition is based on the development of an internal model of                
              the vocal tract during babbling, and will be exploring its                     
              implications, including implications for the perceptual                        
              correlates of coarticulation.  The hypothesis makes certain                    
              predictions about the order of acquisition of various speech                   
              sounds, and another research direction is to test the empirical                
              validity of these predictions.
