Abstract    :
                   The major objective of this effort is to pursue basic and                 
              applied research in the area of ergonomics.  Specific objectives               
              include (1) advancing theory for developing instruments and                    
              analytical methods for measuring and assessing exposure to physical            
              stress in repetitive manual work, (2) investigating performance                
              deficits associated with exposure to these stresses, and (3)                   
              enhancing performance and preventing injuries by establishing                  
              exposure and job design guidelines based on these measurements.                
                   Physical stress in the workplace has been recognized as an                
              underlying cause of decreased productivity, reduced work quality,              
              operator discomfort, worker dissatisfaction, and increased                     
              incidence of injuries.  Disabilities resulting from excessive                  
              exposure to these stresses incur significant costs to industry in              
              the form of medical bills, worker's compensation, reduced                      
              productivity, lost time, and human suffering.  The ultimate goal               
              of this research is the development of effective quantitative                  
              guidelines for enhancing manual performance and protecting workers             
              from harmful exposure to physical stress.
