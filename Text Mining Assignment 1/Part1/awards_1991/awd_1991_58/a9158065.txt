Abstract    :
              The PI's research program will focus primarily on the chemical                 
              ecology and larval biology of marine invertebrates, including                  
              continued collaborative investigations of the functions of                     
              secondary metabolites isolated from marine organisms (particularly             
              anti-fouling and defensive compounds), larval chemoreception prior             
              to settlement, and the influence of hydrodynamics on settlement                
              behavior.
