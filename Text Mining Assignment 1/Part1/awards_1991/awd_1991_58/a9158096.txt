Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Schneider will use this Presidential Young Investigator Award              
              to support an investigation of optically underluminous galaxies.               
              The object is to determine their (potentially very large                       
              contribution to the "missing mass" problem and to determine why                
              star formation has been so inefficient in them.
