Abstract    :
              It is generally believed that increasing the lattice                           
              mismatch beyond the point of pseudomorphic                                     
              growth (thus creating dislocations in the structure)                           
              renders the material useless for electronic devices.                           
              I am currently investigating the possibility that this                         
              belief may not be correct and that in some systems,                            
              it may be greatly advantageous to increase the                                 
              lattice-mismatch past the point of pseudomorphic                               
              growth.  Currently, I am collaborating with two                                
              other Professors one from UW Physics, x-ray                                    
              diffraction and the other from ASU, Physics,                                   
              electron microscopy on a long term project to                                  
              theoretically and experimentally investigate strain                            
              relaxation in near- and over-critical thickness                                
              InGaAs quantum wells and thin films, as well as in                             
              naturally and artificially-graded quantum wells and                            
              thin films.
