Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award.  Dr. Judy Callis'             
              research concerns the reaction pathways and function of the post-              
              translational modification of proteins by the addition of ubiquitin            
              in plants.  Her post-doctoral research laid the groundwork for this            
              area of plant biochemistry.  As a faculty member in the Department             
              of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California,                
              Davis, she is continuing to pursue this important problem in                   
              Arabidopsis, an excellent higher plant system for the molecular                
              genetic and biochemical approaches she has been exploiting so                  
              successfully.  Since joining the faculty at Davis in 1989 she has              
              been active in training graduate and undergraduate students. ***//
