Abstract    :
              The chemistry, bonding, structure and dynamics of single                       
              molecules and molecular complexes on surfaces will be                          
              investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy.  A special                   
              low temperature ultra-high vacuum apparatus in a vibration free                
              room will be used for these studies.  This equipment will be                   
              especially appropriate for a study of vibrational spectra and                  
              microscopic diffusion rates.   The investigation will also                     
              study insulating materials by exploiting their microwave                       
              frequency dielectric properties.

              This five year continuing grant to Pennsylvania State                          
              University for support of Professor Weiss as a Presidential                    
              Young Investigator is designed to promote his rapid and                        
              effective growth as an independent researcher in the area of                   
              Scanning Tunneling Microscopy.   The research, in the general                  
              area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses on evaluating                
              the potential applications and developing new applications for                 
              scanning tunneling microscopy by using a  novel ultra-high                     
              vacuum apparatus.   Important developments in the understanding                
              of surface chemistry and its application to materials science                  
              can be anticipated.
