Abstract    :
              Much of the theoretical work in distributed computing has assumed one          
              of two extreme timing models, either completely synchronous or                 
              completely asynchronous.  The goal of this research is to develop              
              realistic, partially synchronous models and to determine the                   
              relationships among them.  This should help to identify precisely what         
              time behavior is necessary and sufficient for particular properties to         
              hold.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              Complementary work will be to design and analyze distributed                   
              algorithms that have timing-based correctness conditions or rely on            
              specific timing behavior.  Another application area is that of                 
              correctness conditions for systems that support shared objects.  The           
              goal is to understand and unify the large number of different                  
              correctness conditions present in the parallel architectures,                  
              distributed file systems, and operating systems literature, many of            
              which are timing-based, and to quantify tradeoffs between concurrency          
              and time performance.
