Abstract    :
              New chemical strategies for obtaining processable gels from                    
              alkoxide precursors will be sought.  New chemical reagents for                 
              inducing gel formation will be identified, and alkoxide                        
              precursors that decompose to hydroxides by mild thermolysis or                 
              photolysis will be designed.  These will be used for the devel-                
              opment of thermosetting gels and techniques for photolitho-                    
              graphically patterning oxide films, respectively.  Group III,                  
              IV, and V semiconductor nanoclusters will be prepared by                       
              application of a recently discovered, solution-phase phosphide                 
              synthesis.  Major efforts will be made to convert these                        
              amorphous powders into crystalline forms by heating either as                  
              solids or in high boiling solvents.

              Dr. William E. Buhro of Washington University is supported as a                
              Presidential Young Investigator by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,                
              and Organometallic Chemistry Program.  Dr. Buhro's project                     
              seeks to develop new strategies for the fabrication of oxide                   
              and phosphide materials.  Some of these materials may have                     
              important industrial and commercial applications.
