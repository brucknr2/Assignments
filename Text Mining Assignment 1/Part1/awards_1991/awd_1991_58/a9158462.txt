Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The "surface phase" in polymer systems is of enormous scientific               
              and technical importance.  Bonding of interfaces (weldability),                
              friction and wear behaviour, and chemical stability depend on the              
              structure and properties of the surface phase, but polymer science             
              has not yet succeeded in developing a comprehensive approach to                
              characterize and study it.  This proposal requests support to                  
              expend the use of ion beams and neutron and xray scattering to                 
              probe the distribution and conformation of polymer species near                
              surfaces so as to understand how to describe and control the                   
              behaviour of the surface phase.
