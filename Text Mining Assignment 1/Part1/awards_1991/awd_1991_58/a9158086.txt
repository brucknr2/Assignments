Abstract    :
              This research program will develop the use of synthetically                    
              modified DNA as probes for protein-DNA interactions.  Two methods              
              for analysis of the contact regions of protein transcription                   
              factors with DNA are being developed by Dr. Verdine.  These are                
              template-directed interference (TDI) footprinting and base-specific            
              photoaffinity (BSP) crosslinking.  These techniques will be applied            
              to two human transcription factors, NF-Kappa B and NFAT, in order              
              to understand how these factors interact with DNA and regulate gene            
              expression.//
