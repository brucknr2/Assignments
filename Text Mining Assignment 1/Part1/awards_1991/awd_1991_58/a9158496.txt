Abstract    :
              The PI will describe the interannual to intermillenial variability             
              of the surface ocean through novel geochemical techniques developed            
              for reef corals.  Inferred changes in such processes as upwelling              
              and wind genesis during events ranging from El Nino to Earth's last            
              glaciation will yield insights into the role of ocean-atmosphere               
              interactions in regulating global climate change
