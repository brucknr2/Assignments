Abstract    :
              The importance of high performance                                             
              computing to contemporary issues in                                            
              science and engineering has been                                               
              well documented.  It is the goal of                                            
              this Presidential Young Investigator                                           
              to develop efficient algorithms for                                            
              large scale computing, in                                                      
              particular, solution of                                                        
              electromagnetic field problems fine-                                           
              grain systems, e.g. CM and N-Cube.                                             
              The physical problems to be studied                                            
              will include both device modeling as
