Abstract    :
                   This Presidential Young Investigator awardee will continue                
              to work in three areas of probability theory:  measure-valued                  
              diffusions, weakly self-avoiding random walks on hierarchical                  
              lattices, and tree-indexed stochastic processes.  In addition,                 
              Evans has started work on problems in the probabilistic aspects                
              of molecular biology.  The award will enable Evans to continue                 
              his collaborations in all areas of his work, and to gain access                
              to needed computational hardware.
