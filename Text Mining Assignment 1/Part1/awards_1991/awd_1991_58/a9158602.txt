Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Yeates will try to determine the structure of a key                        
              component of the oxygen evolving complex of photosynthesis.                    
              He hopes to answer questions about the mechanism of catalysis                  
              and electron transfer and the nature of the interaction between                
              the oxygen evolving enhancer protein and the photosynthetic                    
              reaction center by determining the crystal structure of the                    
              former.  He plans to develop a new method for analyzing the                    
              surface properties and accessibilities of proteins from their                  
              three dimensional structures.  He also plans to investigate                    
              methods for prediction of protein structure from protein                       
              sequence.  In particular, he intends to test the usefulness of                 
              pattern recognition and neural networks.
