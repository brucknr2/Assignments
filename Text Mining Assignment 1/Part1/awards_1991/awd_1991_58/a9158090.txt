Abstract    :
                   This Presidential Young Investigator Award will enhance                   
              support for John E. Luecke's research in Dehn Surgery on Links, a              
              topic in the topology of three-dimensional manifolds.  A link in               
              a 3-dimensional manifold, M, is a collection of circles embedded               
              in M.  A knot is a link of one component.  The work this year                  
              will have two aspects:  (1) understanding when a non-hyperbolic                
              manifold results from Dehn surgery on a knot with hyperbolic                   
              complement, (2) generalizing results about Dehn surgery on knots               
              to results about Dehn surgery on links with more than one                      
              component.                                                                     
                   Manifolds are natural objects of study, being spaces which                
              are locally but in general not globally like Euclidean space.                  
              The case of three dimensions is the lowest dimension for which                 
              the closed manifolds have not been fully classified.  Knots and                
              links are also natural objects, about which it is surprising how               
              basic are some of the questions still unanswered.
