Abstract    :
              The proposed research involves nonlinear optical laser methods                 
              developed to obtain information about structure, reactions and                 
              dynamics at  molecular surfaces.  A new surface circular dichroism             
              spectroscopy is described.  Studies will focus on chemical                     
              reactions of ozone-depleting chlorocompounds at the ice-vapor                  
              interface, and on the mechanism of antifreeze activity of some                 
              proteins at the ice/water interface.
