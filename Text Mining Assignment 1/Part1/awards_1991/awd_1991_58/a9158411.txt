Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A Presidential Young Investigator Award will support studies to                
              define molecular mechanisms involved in neuronal differentiation.              
              Cell lines derived from cerebellar granule neurons and the                     
              embryonic carcinoma cell line, P19, will be used for subtractive               
              hybridization studies to begin to identify genes that are                      
              specifically expressed in differentiated or undifferentiated cells.            
              Cloning of homologous genes will be used to identify other genes               
              important to differentiation.  Gene transfection will be used to               
              study function of those genes identified.  In addition, factors                
              involved in transcriptional regulation of GAP-43, a neuron-specific            
              gene protein, will be identified.  These studies are fundamental to            
              understanding the mechanisms underlying brain development.
