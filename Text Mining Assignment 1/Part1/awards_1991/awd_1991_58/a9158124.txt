Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant is to provide research support for Dr. Rodney O. Fox                
              under the National Science Foundation's Presidential Young                     
              Investigator Awards Program.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Flow reactors are used for both fundamental kinetic studies and                
              industrial chemical manufacturing.  Dynamic modelling for process              
              control and kinetic studies of flow reactors have involved lumped              
              models consisting of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential                   
              equations.  In formulating these models, it is assumed that the                
              transport processes occur at time scales much shorter than those               
              of the chemical kinetics.  Experimentally it has been assumed that,            
              with the stirring rate sufficiently high, the dynamical behavior               
              depends only on the chemical kinetics.  In fact, bistabilities and             
              time-dependent behavior can be strongly influenced by the premixing            
              configuration and the stirring rate, even when the latter is                   
              relatively fast compared to the residence time.                                
              The PI's research is in the area of studying the effect of mixing              
              on the dynamical behavior of flow reactors.  Specifically, detailed            
              experimental and analytical investigation is planned of the mixing             
              effects in chemical oscillators with the dual goals of                         
              understanding the interplay between transport and chemical                     
              reactions and of developing accurate mixing models for systems                 
              involving multiple reaction steps.  Another area to be looked at               
              will be the mathematical simulation of turbulent reactive flows in             
              flow reactors.  The PI plans to use the probability density                    
              function method using Fokker-Planck closure based on diffusion in              
              the lamellar structures generated by the chaotic flow field.  He               
              plans to look at the effects of reaction terms for nonpremixed feed            
              flows.
