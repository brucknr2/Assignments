Abstract    :
              It is generally acknowledged that                                              
              progress in computational                                                      
              engineering is contingent upon the                                             
              development of a reliable three-                                               
              dimensional discretization scheme.                                             
              This is the goal of this                                                       
              Presidential Young Investigator                                                
              grant to construct a mesh generator                                            
              and to integrate it with a                                                     
              commercially available drawing tool.                                           
              The area chosen as specific                                                    
              applications will be the simulation                                            
              of electromagnetic field phenomena;                                            
              low frequency nonlinear electric and                                           
              magnetic field systems and continuum                                           
              electromechanics.  The new automatic                                           
              mesh generation routine is based on                                            
              Delaunay triangulation and an                                                  
              implementation scheme incorporating                                            
              efficient matrix solves and error                                              
              controls in the boundary element                                               
              formulation.
