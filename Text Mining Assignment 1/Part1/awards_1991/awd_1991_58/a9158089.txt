Abstract    :
              This project will involve experimental research on the electronic,             
              magnetic, and superconducting properties of correlated electron                
              materials, particularly high temperature superconducting copper                
              oxide compounds.  Extensive synthesis and characterization studies             
              will be complemented by electronic, thermal, magnetic, and                     
              transport investigations, including work at high pressures and high            
              magnetic fields.  Emphasis will be on materials research and the               
              study of composition-dependent changes in the magnetic properties              
              and electronic structure.
