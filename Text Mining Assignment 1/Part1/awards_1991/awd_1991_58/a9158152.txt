Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The research will investigate applications of imaging                          
              technology to the nondestructive evaluation of civil                           
              structures.  The initial focus of the research will be on                      
              detection of the reinforcing bars, voids and cracks in                         
              reinforced concrete.  The technology also could be applied                     
              to the nondestructive evaluation of wood, masonry and steel                    
              structures.
