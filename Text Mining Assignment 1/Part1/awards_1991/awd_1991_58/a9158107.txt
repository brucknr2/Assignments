Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Vaccaro will study the spectroscopy,                
              relaxation, and chemical reactivity of rovibrationally excited                 
              polyatomic molecules as a function of both the magnitude and                   
              type of excitation of the molecular framework.  The first                      
              state-to-state measurements of polyatomic reaction dynamics                    
              will be performed.  Novel multiple-resonance laser techniques                  
              will be used to prepare molecules in specific                                  
              rotation-vibration states.

              Studies of the reactivity of polyatomic molecules which contain                
              chemically significant quantities of energy of excitation are                  
              important because of the information they can reveal about                     
              aeronomic and combustion-related processes.  On a fundamental                  
              scientific level, these transient species can reveal much                      
              regarding the nature and origin of such phenomena as mode- or                  
              bond-specific chemistry and quantum chaos.
