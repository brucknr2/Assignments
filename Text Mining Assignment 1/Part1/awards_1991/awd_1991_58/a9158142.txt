Abstract    :
              Under a Presidential Young Investigator Award, research will                   
              be conducted on compressible turbulent flows and on related                    
              issues in acoustics.  Both direct numerical simulations and                    
              theoretical analysis will be utilized.  Compressibility                        
              effects on various scales of motion in the turbulence field,                   
              on the cascade of energy between scales, and on energy                         
              dissipation at the small scales will be studied.                               
              Engineering model  for more accurate prediction of                             
              compressible flows will be developed for application to                        
              various high speed and combustion flow system.
