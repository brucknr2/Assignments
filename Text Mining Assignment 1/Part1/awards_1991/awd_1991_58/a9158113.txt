Abstract    :
              The PI will study symbiotic associations between chemoautotrophic              
              bacteria and marine invertebrates using two general approaches.                
              The first involves in-situ approaches to detailed investigations               
              of their habitat, distribution, and physiological ecology.  The                
              second will use physiological methods to characterize isolated                 
              symbionts and quantify host-symbiont interactions.
