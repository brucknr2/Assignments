Abstract    :
              This is a Presidential Young Investigator award to support Dr.                 
              Buchman's studies concerning the molecular mechanisms governing                
              gene expression and chromosome organization in yeast.  His                     
              experiments will help characterize classes of protein-protein and              
              protein-DNA interactions generally employed to create compound                 
              regulatory elements.  Results of those experiments will help answer            
              questions such as: How do diverse genetic elements combine to                  
              create a completely different regulatory element? How do regional              
              changes in chromatin structure affect gene expression?  How are                
              significance of this research is that it addresses fundamental                 
              questions of chromosome organization in a simple eukaryotic that               
              should be applicable as well to higher eukaryotic systems.
