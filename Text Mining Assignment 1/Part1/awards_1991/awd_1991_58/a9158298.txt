Abstract    :
              The investigator's research is focused on the use of observations              
              of Earth's magnetic field to develop and constrain theories of the             
              origin and evolution of the magnetic field; on investigations of               
              the structure and dynamics of Earth's deep interior; and on                    
              investigations of the magnetic fields of other planets.
