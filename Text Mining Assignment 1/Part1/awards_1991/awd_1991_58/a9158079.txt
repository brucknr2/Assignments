Abstract    :
              Dr. Gregory A. Voth is supported by a Presidential Young                       
              Investigator Grant in the Theoretical and Computational                        
              Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of chemical                   
              dynamics in condensed systems.  Voth's research involves the                   
              development of both analytical and computer simulation                         
              techniques with the primary goal of formulating predictive                     
              mathematical theories which characterize chemical dynamical                    
              problems of interest.  One major thrust of the research is to                  
              formulate a general description of activated rate processes                    
              such as chemical reactions in condensed phases that carefully                  
              treat quantum effects as well as the specific microscopic                      
              interactions between reactive subsystems and the condensed                     
              phase enviroment.  A second thurst of the research is to                       
              develop a theory for the ablation of polymer surfaces by laser                 
              radiation.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Research under this Presidential Young Investigator award will                 
              provide important theoretical insights into the molecular level                
              understanding of the factors which affect chemical reactions in                
              solutions.
