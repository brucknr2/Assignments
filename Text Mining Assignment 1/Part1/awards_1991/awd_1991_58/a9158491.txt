Abstract    :
              Ferguson         The focus is on developing cost-effective testing 
              methodologies that detect more defective ICs than current  methods.  There are
              two approaches to manufacturing test.  The  use of high-level fault models
              reduces test generation costs, but  furnish lower quality tests.  The use of
              low-level fault models  increases the quality of circuits that have passed the
              tests, but  causes testing costs to mushroom.  This research integrates these 
              two techniques so that tests can be generated that detect  virtually all
              plausible manufacturing defects without excessive  automatic test pattern
              generation costs.  The approach is to  develop a software tool, "Carafe"
              (circuit and realistic fault  detector), which determines the most likely
              faults to occur in a  CMOS circuit.  It exploits the hierarchical nature of
              VLSI  circuit designs, making fault extraction faster and more memory 
              efficient.  Also it supports multi-level metal CMOS technologies.
