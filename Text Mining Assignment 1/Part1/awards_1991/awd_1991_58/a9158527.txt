Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator project includes studies                  
              of transition-metal nitrides and carbides, organometallic                      
              cluster-derived materials, and amorphous and metastable                        
              materials.  Nitrides and carbides of early transition metals                   
              are prepared as well-defined thin films by using ion-beam                      
              techniques, and as high-surface-area particulate using solid-                  
              state reactions; catalytic and electrocatalytic applications                   
              of these materials are then investigated.  Organometallic                      
              clusters containing bridging sulfido, nitrido, or carbido                      
              ligands are studied as precursors to electronic materials or                   
              ultradispersed ensembles on oxide supports for catalytic                       
              applications.  Catalytic properties of amorphous or metastable                 
              materials prepared by ion-beam techniques are investigated.
