Abstract    :
                   The research area that this principal investigator (PI) will              
              focus on during his Presidential Young Investigator award is the               
              control and management of information flow in communication                    
              networks.  The focus will be on overcoming the bottlenecks of                  
              switching and network processing that result from using optical                
              transmission and electronic devices.  Processing bottlenecks may               
              arise in network protocols.  The PI plans to develop analysis                  
              techniques for evaluating performance of higher level protocols                
              using, for example, a non-statistical approach to predict worst                
              case performance.  To address the switching bottleneck, the PI                 
              plans to synthesize and investigate the performance of switching               
              architectures which utilize massively parallel processing and the              
              benefits of spatial statistical multiplexing and deflection                    
              routing.
