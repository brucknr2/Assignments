Abstract    :
              The proposed research expands current work at the grain scale on               
              eolian sediment transport into the multiple grainsize realm and                
              into the Martian and snow systems.  The PI will explore mountain               
              scale evolution due to growth by characteristic earthquakes, and               
              decay by a suite of realistic geomorphic processes acting at                   
              smaller scales.
