Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The subject of this research is the processing and characterization            
              of nanocrystalline alumina and yttria stabilized zirconia ceramics.            
              Two approaches will be taken for the processing of nano-sized                  
              powders, namely consolidation by plastic deformation and                       
              consolidation by wet-processing. For plastic deformation green                 
              bodies will be subjected to high shear stresses at moderate                    
              temperatures to accomplish pore closure without extensive grain                
              growth. In wet-processing the focus will be on particle-particle               
              interactions and the resulting domain cluster size as related to               
              the final grain size of the consolidated ceramic. The resulting                
              materials will be tested for superplasticity, ionic conductivity,              
              and other properties of interest. This research will develop the               
              scientific and technical understanding necessary to produce bulk               
              nanocrystalline ceramics for electronic and structural                         
              applications.
