Abstract    :
              The plan of the PI is to establish a research program                          
              in the analysis, design, and experimental evaluation of                        
              electro-optic anisotropic (biaxial) waveguide devices,                         
              such as laser modulators.  Specific aspects of this                            
              program will be 1) developing analysis - techniques                            
              based on derived theory of the PI, 2) designing new                            
              devices using these techniques, and 3) fabricating and                         
              characterizing these devices.  Previous work of the PI,                        
              based on exact electromagnetic theory with no                                  
              simplifying assumptions, provides new insight into the                         
              nature of propagating hybrid modes in these                                    
              structures.  This theory will be extended to quantify                          
              analytically how the electro-optic effect can be                               
              utilized to control cutoff and waveguiding as a                                
              function of applied voltage and wavelength.                                    
              Furthermore, the knowledge gained on biaxial                                   
              waveguides will be applied to optimize phase-                                  
              matching conditions and coherence lengths for                                  
              efficient second harmonic generation in waveguides.                            
              LiNbO3 and GaAs are commonly used materials                                    
              which possess both electro-optic (induced anisotropy)                          
              and second harmonic generation properties.  This                               
              research will result in analysis techniques, not                               
              presently available, to design and evaluate practical                          
              waveguides with anisotropy and second order optical                            
              effects at different voltage levels, applied voltage                           
              directions, and wavelengths.  The experimental                                 
              program will be initiated with a look at GaAs                                  
              waveguides.
