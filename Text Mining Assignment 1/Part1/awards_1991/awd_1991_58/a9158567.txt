Abstract    :
              This award provides support under the National Science                         
              Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards Program.  The              
              objectives of this program is to provide research support to the               
              Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and                      
              engineering faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the                   
              capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand              
              for highly qualified science and engineering personnel for                     
              academic and industrial research and teaching.                                 
                                                                                             
              This award will allow the investigator to pursue her research in               
              the area of financial economics.  She will continue and extend                 
              her work focusing share-holder behavior, risk taking, and stock                
              value.  She will examine the inception and disagreement, the                   
              strategic manipulation of disagreement, and the effect of stock                
              holder disagreement on firm decision making and the design of                  
              securities and corporations.  This general line of research will               
              provide a new understanding of the role of the firm, of investor               
              decision making and of securities and their markets.  It will                  
              also improve our ability to organize and regulate markets, to                  
              create financial innovation, and to understand the effects of tax              
              policy on investor and corporate behavior.
