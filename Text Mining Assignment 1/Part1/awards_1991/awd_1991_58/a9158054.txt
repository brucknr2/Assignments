Abstract    :
                   Magnetic suspension techniques are quite promising for the                
              control of precision motion, since they eliminate the high surface             
              finish requirements of traditional mechanical bearings, and allow              
              the direct control of stage dynamics.  The goal of this project is             
              to investigate magnetic suspension techniques for precision motion             
              control at the nanometer level.  To achieve such performance                   
              requires advances in sensors, mechanical design, and the design and            
              control of electromagnetic actuators.  Initial experimental effort             
              will focus on the design and construction of a prototype linear                
              bearing and motor system which is designed to achieve one nanometer            
              resolution with a travel of 50 millimeters.  Envisioned application            
              areas for the developed technology are precision stages for                    
              photolithography, scanned probe microscopy, and other precision                
              manufacturing tasks.
