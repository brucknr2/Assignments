Abstract    :
              Gender in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is determined by             
              the ratio of X to Y chromosomes. Thus it is necessary that some                
              mechanism to equalize the levels of gene products in males and                 
              females produced by the sex-linked genes be invoked. A regulatory              
              protein was identified by Kuroda and Baker which can be shown to be            
              predominantly associated with the X chromosome in males but not in             
              females, suggesting that it may be involved in the increased                   
              transcription seen in males to compensate for the larger number of             
              gene copies found in females. The goal of the work to be done is to            
              dissect and to understand the biochemical basis of dosage                      
              compensation.***
