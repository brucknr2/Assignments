Abstract    :
                   Recently developed ultrashort-pulse (10-20 fsec) laser                    
              technology is applied to the study of the interaction of high-                 
              intensity laser pulses with plasmas, gases and solids.  Two areas              
              are emphasized in this five-year Presidential Young Investigator               
              Program:                                                                       
                   1) The interaction of intense laser pulses with waves in                  
              plasmas to generate tunable radiation in the infrared, visible,                
              and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum, as well as the                        
              acceleration of charged particles; and                                         
                   2)  the study of ultrafast x-ray physics, including time-                 
              resolved auger-electron spectroscopy, x-ray absorption and                     
              diffraction and the chemical dynamic of x-ray ionized molecules.
