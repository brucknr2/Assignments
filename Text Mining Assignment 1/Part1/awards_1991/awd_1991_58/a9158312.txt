Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research supported by this grant consists of two general areas:            
              glass-ceramics for electronic applications, and thermodynamic                  
              modeling of ferroelectric ceramics. In the first area, the                     
              objective of the research is to develop an understanding of how                
              compositional and processing control of the microstructure can be              
              used to tailor the dielectric, thermal, and mechanical properties              
              of glass-ceramics. The research will also include the                          
              microstructural design of piezo-, pyro-, and ferro-electric glass              
              ceramics. In the second area, the objective is to utilize                      
              thermodynamic principles to explain the phase stability in ferro-              
              electric ceramic systems. This research will be useful in providing            
              new glass-ceramic materials for future microelectronic                         
              applications.
