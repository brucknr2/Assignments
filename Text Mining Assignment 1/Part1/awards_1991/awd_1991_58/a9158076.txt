Abstract    :
              The PI's work will be divided into two parts, identifying new                  
              "gravitational lens" systems at extragalactic distances and                    
              observations of cool stars with coronae.  The PI will be                       
              conducting observations of gravitational lens candidates first                 
              identified in the MIT-Green Bank radio survey.  In collaboration               
              with J. Lehar, D. Roberts, and B. Burke, she has just completed                
              monitoring the gravitational lens 0957+561.  These measurements                
              have resulted in a lens time delay, which can be used to put limits            
              on the cosmological Hubble's constant.  Observations are commencing            
              on the Einstein ring system MG1131+0456, aimed at characterizing               
              its radio light curve in order to determine whether time delay                 
              measurements can be made with this object as well.   The PI will               
              also conduct observations on active cool main sequence ("dMe")                 
              stars to determine whether they have low-mass companions.  These               
              observations will be made with a variety of collaborators in the               
              U.S. and France.  Trial observations to date have succeeded in                 
              detecting the presence of "coronae" around such active stars as YZ             
              CMi, EV Lac, and AD Leo.   Further observations of these stars will            
              be made to determine the extents of these coronae around the stars             
              exciting them.
