Abstract    :
              Adaptive control has evolved in the past three                                 
              decades and has provided a framework within which                              
              the control of unknown dynamic systems can be                                  
              carried out.  While fundamental results have been                              
              derived for linear time-invariant systems with                                 
              unknown parameters, the scope of theory needs to be                            
              significantly enlarged to include nonlinearities,                              
              unmodeled dynamics, and large parameter variations                             
              before adaptive control can be used as a design                                
              methodology for complex dynamic systems.  The                                  
              research will focus on flexible structures, aircraft                           
              systems, and tactile sensing for robots.  The intent is                        
              to directly address, in each application, the underlying                       
              dynamical system and its peculiarities.  The objective                         
              is to develop adaptive controllers, for each                                   
              application, by understanding the nature of                                    
              uncertainties present and the quality of prior                                 
              information.
