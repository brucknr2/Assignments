Abstract    :
              The traditional application areas of millimeter-wave                           
              radiation are in the fields of radio-astronomy, remote                         
              sensing, plasma diagnostics, and imaging through dust                          
              and fog in military situations.  It is the purpose of my                       
              Presidential Young Investigator research effort to                             
              develop low-cost millimeter-wave integrated antennas,                          
              receivers and transmitting systems.  This research will                        
              open the doors to many civilian application areas                              
              such as collision avoidance systems, landing systems,                          
              small portable communication systems, etc.  Providing                          
              high performance and less expensive receivers will                             
              also enhance the radio-astronomical and remote-                                
              sensing application areas.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The proposed research plan is as follows:  l) Develop                          
              100-500 GHz low-noise planar receivers using high-                             
              efficiency integrated horn antennas and Schottky-                              
              diodes.  Also, use newly-developed 90 GHz low-noise                            
              amplifiers with a planar antenna and a CPW                                     
              (coplanar-waveguide) matching network to result in                             
              a low-noise receiver with gain.  2) Generate                                   
              efficiently 100-1000 GHz radiation from solid-state                            
              sources such as planar varactors and transistors                               
              coupled to antennas.  Different circuit configurations                         
              that allow phase-locking and frequency sweeping will                           
              be investigated.  The output can be used as local                              
              oscillator in a receiver set-up or as a transmitter for                        
              short-range radar applications.
