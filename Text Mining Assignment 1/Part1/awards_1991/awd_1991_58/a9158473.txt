Abstract    :
              This is the first year base amount funding of a five-year PYI                  
              continuing award.  This PYI will continue his research on                      
              distributed artificial intelligence (AI) with an emphasis on                   
              building intelligent computing systems for dynamic, multiagent                 
              applications.  The research uses blackboard systems and other                  
              integrating architectures that allow an agent's perception,                    
              reasoning, communication, and motor components to collectively                 
              control an agent's behavior.  The PI is also pursuing work in                  
              real-time artificial intelligence.  He is working on developing                
              preliminary theories of real-time reasoning that account for both              
              meeting deadlines and for negotiating to change deadlines.  This               
              work on techniques for negotiating ties into his additional                    
              research interest in uncovering the  general principles                        
              underlying coordination between intelligent agents.  The goal is               
              to build interdisciplinary theories of coordination, drawing on                
              concepts from management science and operations research as well               
              as AI, and to embody these theories in practical mechanisms for                
              coordinating multiple intelligent computing systems.  The near                 
              term plan is to develop a core of interdisciplinary concepts                   
              using a hierarchy of behavioral specifications as a common                     
              representation, with the long-term objective of developing                     
              fundamental theories of a science of coordination.  The                        
              researcher is also interested in applying techniques for                       
              coordinating AI systems to problems in human-human and human-                  
              computer interactions.
