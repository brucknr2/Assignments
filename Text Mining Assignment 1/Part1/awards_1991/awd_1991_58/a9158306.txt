Abstract    :
                   This Presidential Young Investigator will work on Mordell-                
              Weil lattices of elliptic surfaces, the size and structure of the              
              Tate-Safarevic group and the connection to coding theory via the               
              Barnes-Wall lattices.                                                          
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
