Abstract    :
              Larrabee         This research is based on an automatic test pattern  generation
              (ATPG) system (called Nemesis) that generates a test  pattern for a given fault
              by first constructing a formula  representing all possible tests for the fault,
              and then applying  a Boolean satisfiability algorithm to the resulting formula.
                This method separates the formula extraction from the formula  satisfaction
              thus providing flexibility and generality.  A  testing system, based on
              Nemesis, that will generate tests  detecting all realistic manufacturing
              defects in both  combinational and sequential ICs is being developed.
