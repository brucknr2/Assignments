Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              As artificially structured materials shrink towards dimensions                 
              where quantum-mechanical effects become paramount, and the inter-              
              connections between optical and electronic devices increase, the               
              understanding of optical/transport interactions will be a                      
              fundamental tool with which to enter the next century in                       
              electronics.  By combining optical and transport measurement                   
              techniques with the fabrication of novel structures, one will                  
              investigate phenomena such as electron-electron and electron-hole              
              coupling, edge-state conduction and one-dimensional quantum                    
              transport, electron crysallization, electron-hole condensation and             
              the thermodynamic properties of reduced-dimension systems.
