Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The photosynthetic reaction center in which, on absorption of                  
              a photon of light, an electron is forced to travel sequentially                
              through various component molecules making up the center, has                  
              a two-fold axis of symmetry.  However, it is surprising that                   
              the electron transfer follows an asymmetric pathway, travelling                
              down only one specific side of the symmetrical unit.  Dr.                      
              Woodbury will combine molecular genetic techniques with modern                 
              spectroscopic analysis techniques to determine direction,                      
              kinetics and thermodynamics of the electron transport in an                    
              attempt to explain this puzzling charge separation process.
