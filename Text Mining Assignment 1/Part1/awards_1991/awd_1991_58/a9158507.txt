Abstract    :
              The proposed research is directed                                              
              to understanding the factors that                                              
              govern the response of cartilage to                                            
              external mechanical forces.  The                                               
              remodeling of cartilage, like that                                             
              of bone, is a very complex response                                            
              that involves a variety of chemical                                            
              factors in addition to the physical                                            
              forces.  The PI will combine                                                   
              techniques of engineering,                                                     
              biophysics, and cellular and                                                   
              molecular biology to study how                                                 
              cells regulate tissue composition                                              
              and material properties.  The work                                             
              will include the use of NMR                                                    
              spectroscopy and imaging techniques                                            
              for the evaluation of the                                                      
              biochemical and mechanical states                                              
              of cartilage.  These basic                                                     
              bioengineering studies will result                                             
              in a better understanding of the                                               
              remodeling of connective tissue,                                               
              and should eventually result in                                                
              better diagnostic and therapeutic                                              
              techniques.
