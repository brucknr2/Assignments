Abstract    :
              This grant supports continuation of work on the molecular biology              
              of a molecular "switch" that causes alternate expression of the                
              flagellin genes of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium.  Both                 
              genetic and biochemical approaches will be taken on defining the               
              roles of protein-protein interactions in the enhancer stimulated               
              recombination reaction that inverts a critical piece of DNA on the             
              bacterial genome.  In addition to these studies, new work will be              
              started on another antigenic variation system in bacteria, that of             
              the bacterium Mycoplasma hyorhinis.  This bacterium exhibits                   
              antigenic variation of its lipid-modified surface proteins.  The               
              complex patterns of alteration in antigenic nature and size of the             
              surface proteins suggest a very interesting and perhaps novel                  
              mechanisms of control.  A plasmid or transposon system for                     
              mutational studies will be developed in order to facilitate studies            
              in Mycoplasma, organisms with the smallest known genomes of any                
              living organisms.
