Abstract    :
                   This award provides two-thirds of the funds required to                   
              upgrade the equipment in the paleomagnetics laboratory of the                  
              Department of Geology and Planetary Science at the University of               
              Pittsburgh. The University is committed to providing the remaining             
              funds needed for the equipment acquisition. A cryogenically                    
              superconducting magnetometer, thermal demagnetizer, and sample                 
              transport system will be installed.                                            
                   The paleomagnetics lab will use the upgraded equipment in                 
              research projects that include paleostratigraphic analysis of                  
              samples from northeastern USSR, magnetite formation in prokaryotes             
              and the role of bacteria in the magnetization of sediments, cave               
              sediment magnetostratigraphy (dating) in classic hominid fossil                
              sites of Africa.
