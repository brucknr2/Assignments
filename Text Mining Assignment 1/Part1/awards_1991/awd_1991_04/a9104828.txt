Abstract    :
              The geochemistry of the constituent minerals of spinel                         
              lherzolites suggests that the MORB-depleted lithosphere underwent              
              significant enrichment in incompatible minor and trace elements                
              during Koolau (tholeiitic) and Honolulu (alkalic) magmatic                     
              activity.  An investigation into the enrichment processes has led              
              to the development of the present 1 year proposal designed to                  
              explore the nature, chemical composition, and origin of isolated               
              crystal-laden glass pockets, some of which may have activity                   
              provided the elements in which these xenoliths have been                       
              enriched.  Extensive electron microprobe analysis (major and                   
              minor elements) and preliminary ion microprobe analysis (REES) of              
              the phases in these pockets will be performed in this project.                 
              The results will allow evaluation of the various models concerned              
              with origins of the various types of glasses found.
