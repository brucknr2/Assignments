Abstract    :
                   Professors Enflo and Lomonosov will explore a number of areas             
              of analysis including: (1) problems in number theory involving                 
              bounds on number theoretic sums, (2) non-linear problems in Banach             
              spaces including the relationship between homeomorphisms and                   
              isomorphisms of Banach spaces, and (3) the invariant subspace                  
              problem.                                                                       
                   The problems which Professors Enflo and Lomonosov will study              
              are extremely diverse.  Perhaps the most important is their joint              
              project on the invariant subspace problem.  In a finite dimensional            
              space, every linear operator (matrix) has an eigenvector and thus              
              multiples of this vector form an invariant subspace.  This is no               
              longer true in infinite dimensions but remains true in important               
              special cases.  The principal investigators will study to what                 
              extent certain classes of operators have nontrivial invariant                  
              subspaces in special but important infinite dimensional spaces.
