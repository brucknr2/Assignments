Abstract    :
                   Professor Kaminker will investigate a number of problems: (i)             
              the use of operator algebras and cyclic cohomology in the index                
              theory of elliptic operators, (ii) the leafwise Toeplitz extension             
              on a foliated manifold, (iii) the theory of higher eta invariants              
              which will be applied to obtain information about algebraic K-                 
              theory, (iv) cyclic cohomology and elliptic boundary value                     
              problems, and (v) secondary invariants for commuting n-tuples of               
              operators.                                                                     
                   These problems all involve Hilbert space operators and their              
              relation to the geometric properties of manifolds, the higher                  
              dimensional analogues of surfaces.  Elliptic operators play a large            
              role in this work.  Such operators occur in many of the partial                
              differential equations of applied mathematics and physics.
