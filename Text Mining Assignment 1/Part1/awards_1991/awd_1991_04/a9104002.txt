Abstract    :
              The objective of this symposium is to serve as a technology                    
              transfer vehicle to exchange knowledge gained from recent                      
              developments in the U.S. and abroad in novel Engineering Materials             
              and Applications, Design, Quality Control and Construction Practice            
              on "Grouting, Soil Improvement and Geosynthetics."  The Symposium              
              will be an extension of the ASCE Specialty Conference on "Gouting              
              and Soil Improvement, GSI-92" being organized by ASCE in New                   
              Orleans, Louisiana, February 25-28, 1992.  The proposed symposium              
              will provide an international forum for summarizing the state-of-              
              the-art and stimulate further research.
