Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a training grant which allows an ecological                    
              anthropologist at Indiana university to study remote sensing and               
              Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to advance his ongoing study              
              of the tropical forest environment in Brazil.  The investigator                
              will learn the use of specialized computer programs for analyzing              
              various types of environmental and social data in a geographic                 
              context.  After the training period the investigator will                      
              continue his analysis of the causes of deforestation in the                    
              Amazon Basin.
