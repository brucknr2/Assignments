Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This meeting on Molecular Biology of Signal Transduction in Plants             
              will be an open international meeting devoted to fundamental                   
              research on different aspects of this field, with emphasis on                  
              molecular and genetic approaches.  The development of a higher                 
              plant is regulated by a multitude of signals from within and                   
              without, that evoke both generalized and specific biological                   
              responses.  Therefore an understanding of signal transduction in               
              plants is vital to understanding plant development.  The need for              
              a meeting on this subject is evidenced by the rapid advances in                
              this field during the last few years, in areas that range from                 
              environmental receptors to transcription factors.  This meeting                
              will allow presentation of recent results and methodologies in                 
              these different aspects of the field within a common framework, in             
              an atmosphere of face to face contact.  The areas to be covered by             
              the meeting are 1) Environmental Receptors, 2) Hormone Receptors               
              3) Cell-Cell Recognition 4) G-proteins and Protein Kinases 4)                  
              Transcription Factors, 5) Mutants in Signalling Pathways 6)                    
              Transgenic Approaches.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This international conference will promote further research and the            
              synthesis of ideas in the rapidly moving field of cellular signal              
              transduction in plants.
