Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Elicitor treatment of bean or soybean cell suspension cultures                 
              causes rapid cross-linking of preexisting structural proteins in               
              the plant cell wall, following a burst of oxidative metabolism and             
              generation of hydrogen peroxide at the plant cell surface.                     
              Oxidative cross-linking is also under developmental control                    
              associated with cellular maturation, eg., during hypocotyl growth,             
              and in tissues subject to mechanical stress, eg., the stem-petiole             
              junction.  Stimulus-dependent oxidative cross-linking of pre-                  
              existing structural proteins in the plant cell wall is a novel site            
              of cellular regulation, with potentially important functions in                
              the flexible realization of the final functional architecture of               
              cell walls during plant development, and rapid toughening of walls             
              in the initial stages of microbial attack or related stresses.                 
              Moreover, the rapid response to defined elicitors, which is                    
              initiated within 1-2 minutes and complete within 5-10 minutes,                 
              provides the basis for functional dissection of the initial steps              
              in the perception and transduction of elicitor signals.  The                   
              present proposal seeks to explore the regulation of oxidative                  
              cross-linking, underlying signal mechanisms and the impact of                  
              cross-linking on cell wall properties.//
