Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the use of artificial nanostructures            
              as a tool to study the growth, interface structure and stability of            
              amorphous and crystalline semiconductors.  The research will                   
              address structure, structural relaxation, atomic diffusion and                 
              crystallization of tetrahedrally-based amorphous semiconductor                 
              materials (amorphous silicon and related materials).  In addition              
              the growth and properties of amorphous silicon and related thin                
              films with particular emphasis on the relationship between                     
              structure and electronic properties.  The techniques to be utilized            
              include: 1) Raman scattering (useful for the study of local bonding            
              and order); 2) x-ray reflectivity (useful for the study of density,            
              interface roughness and interdiffusion); 3) optical absorption and             
              photoconductivity (sensitive to the electronic charge in the layers            
              and interfaces).  The analysis of the data from these different                
              techniques requires different sets of assumptions about materials              
              and their structure.  Nanostructured semiconductor-based materials             
              are important technologically for photoelectronic detectors and                
              arrays, field effect display drivers, photovoltaic devices, optical            
              modulation and non-linear optical devices as well as catalysts and             
              catalyst supports for commercial reactions.
