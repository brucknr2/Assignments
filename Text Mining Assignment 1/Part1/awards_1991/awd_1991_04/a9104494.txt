Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Prolactin (PRL) is a hormone which is very important in the                    
              regulation of salt and water balance,  and in reproduction and in              
              the stimulation of mammary growth and function.  The pituitary of              
              bony fishes is an attractive system for studying prolactin (PRL)               
              secretion.  Unique among vertebrate animals, teleost PRL cells are             
              segregated as a nearly homogeneous mass which is easily separated              
              for study in isolation from other body systems.  Also, these PRL               
              cells can be maintained in their normal cell-cell associations for             
              at least two weeks in culture dishes.  These features facilitate               
              the achievement of the goals of this project which are to                      
              characterize PRL secretory mechanisms using normal (i.e. not                   
              cancerous) tissues.  Studies will be directed toward the                       
              examination of several peptide and steroid hormones that may be                
              important regulators of PRL cell function.  These factors will be              
              used to continue the characterization of the mechanisms that                   
              control PRL cells.  Companion studies will examine the manner in               
              which the PRL cell responds to osmotic pressure.  These studies                
              will help to clarify how the secretion of the hormones that control            
              salt and water balance is regulated.//
