Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the State University of New York              
              at Buffalo will purchase a configuration of workstations which                 
              will be dedicated to support research in the mathematical                      
              sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research                     
              projects, in particular, studying links via closed braids;                     
              plastic deformation of granular material; composed folding in                  
              dynamical systems - analysis and numerical experiment and                      
              numerical studies of the Vlasov-Poisson equation.
