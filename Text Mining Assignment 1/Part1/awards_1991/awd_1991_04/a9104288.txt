Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the solubility of minerals               
              at pressures ranging from 5 to 20 kilobars and temperatures ranging            
              from 500 to 1000 C using piston cylinder apparatus. The resulting              
              data will provide a basis for quantitative analysis of mass                    
              transfer by fluids in high pressure metamorphic environments within            
              the Earth.
