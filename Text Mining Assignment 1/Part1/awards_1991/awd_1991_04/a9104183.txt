Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with two related problems in the                
              representation theory of p-adic groups.  One is concerned with                 
              finding invariants of certain compact open subgroups in admissible             
              representations of reductive groups over local fields.  The other              
              is concerned with the relationship between the Steinberg module of             
              an algebraic Q-group, and the cohomology of its arithmetic                     
              subgroups.                                                                     
                   This research is in the area of representation theory of                  
              p-adic groups.  The principal investigator will try to find                    
              invariants which measure certain properties of these groups.  This             
              work would have important implications for the theory of                       
              automorphic forms.  It will be of interest to algebraists and                  
              number theorists alike.
