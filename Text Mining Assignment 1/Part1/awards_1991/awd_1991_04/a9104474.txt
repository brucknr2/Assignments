Abstract    :
                   This award provides for continued operation of the armored                
              T-28 meteorologic research aircraft system as a nation facility                
              for research into cloud, thunderstorm, and hailstorm processes.                
              The cooperative agreement under which this project would be                    
              funded provides for the management, staffing, upgrading, testing,              
              operation, and maintenance of the T-28 facility.  The aircraft                 
              will be available to the NSF scientific community for                          
              penetrations of mature storms in support of planned research                   
              projects such as CaPE or STORM.  The aircraft will be upgraded                 
              with electric field measuring devices which will enhance the                   
              scientific capabilities of the facility.  A post-doc has been                  
              added to the staff.   This will strength the educational aspects               
              of this facility as well as help to improve observational-                     
              oriented research activities at the facility.//
