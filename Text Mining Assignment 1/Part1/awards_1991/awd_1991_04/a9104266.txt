Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will experimentally study the                       
              compositional variations of chemically simple amphibole minerals               
              in response to pressure, temperature, and compositional conditions             
              of formation. The resulting data will lead to the thermodynamic                
              characterization of these amphiboles, and to their use as                      
              geothermometers and geobarometers, tools that help geologists                  
              reconstruct the history of the Earth.
