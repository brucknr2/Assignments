Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Vibrio fischeri is a marine bacterium that forms a symbiotic                   
              relationship in the light organs of monocentrid fish.  A recent                
              finding of the PI reveals that the bacterium produces a                        
              phosphodiesterase (CDPase) for cyclic AMP that is of unusual                   
              activity and specificity, and is periplasmic in location.  The                 
              biochemical characteristics, cellular regulation, and functional               
              role of this activity will be examined by a wide spectrum of                   
              analytical approaches, including gene cloning and replacement                  
              methods, in order to assess the possibility of nucleotide-based                
              biochemical interactions between these symbiotic bacteria and their            
              hosts.//
