Abstract    :
                   Recent work by the PI's and others has shown that the role of             
              fluids in the deformation of earth's crust is extremely important              
              and yet imperfectly understood.  The interaction of fluids with                
              active deformation zones (faults) is a profitable area for research            
              because many of the fault rocks contain evidence, in the form of               
              fluid inclusions, for the physical and chemical conditions that                
              prevailed during faulting.  This study will test a general                     
              hypothesis that the presence and separation of dissolved CO2 in                
              fault zone fluids plays a crucial role in earthquake generation.               
              Two active normal faults in Utah will be used as test sites for the            
              presence of CO2-rich fluids and paleo-fluid pressure gradients.                
              In addition, the relationship between fault zone structure and                 
              fluid channels will be quantified.  The results will have major                
              impact and our understanding of fluids in fault initiation and                 
              propagation processes and will enhance understanding of earthquake             
              mechanisms.
