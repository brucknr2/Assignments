Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses basic research issues on the synthesis and              
              processing of diamond films.  Microwave plasma assisted chemical               
              vapor deposition is used to synthesize the films under a variety of            
              deposition conditions, and a parametric variation of these                     
              conditions will be conducted to achieve films with improved                    
              structural, optical, and electronic properties.  Emphasis will be              
              placed on the characterization of the effects that lattice defects             
              have on the electronic and optical properties.  The research                   
              program seeks to obtain fundamental information on the nucleation              
              and growth of three crystallographic orientations, (100), (110),               
              and (111), and to understand the details of atomic structure in                
              these growth sectors.  Diamond films have many potential                       
              technological applications ranging from wear-resistant coatings to             
              more sophisticated and demanding uses such as primary electronic               
              and optical materials with particular advantages for use in high               
              temperature environments.
