Abstract    :
                   This is a combined observational and theoretical attack on the            
              problem of amplification of seismic waves in sedimentary basins,               
              using the Salt Lake Valley in Utah as our field laboratory.  Ten               
              three-component, broadband, digital seismographs will be deployed              
              for at least six months in an X-shaped array extending across the              
              sedimentary deposits in the valley and onto the hard bedrock in the            
              surrounding mountains.  Teleseisms and local and regional                      
              earthquakes and blasts recorded at these stations will provide                 
              important new data on site amplification in the Salt Lake Valley,              
              and in particular its sensitivity to source location.
