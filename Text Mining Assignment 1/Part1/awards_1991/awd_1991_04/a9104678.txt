Abstract    :
              This is an international travel grant to support the                           
              principal investigator's participation in the                                  
              "International Symposium on Building Technology and                            
              Earthquake Hazard Mitigation", scheduled for March 25-29,                      
              1991 in Kunning, China.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The Symposium is jointly organized by the National Center                      
              for Earthquake Engineering Research (NCEER) at the State                       
              University of New York and the China Building Academy in                       
              Beijing.  It will be implemented under Annex III of the                        
              US-China Protocol on Cooperative Earthquake Studies, for                       
              which the Division of Biological and Critical Systems at                       
              NSF is the implementing agency on the American side.                           
                                                                                             
              The principal investigator has an outstanding track                            
              record of successful research in hazard mitigation, and                        
              is an invited symposium speaker.                                               
                                                                                             
              The activity will advance knowledge and the technological                      
              basis for earthquake countermeasures and will stimulate                        
              bilateral research in this important area.
