Abstract    :
                   This award will support the research activities of three                  
              investigators in several areas of symbolic, smooth, and measurable             
              dynamics.  Among the topics in symbolic dynamics are automorphisms             
              of the shift, inverse problems for non-negative matrices, and                  
              general structural questions.  In smooth dynamics some of the                  
              topics are ergodicity and topological transitivity of partially                
              hyperbolic dynamical systems, geodesic flows, and singular spaces              
              of non-positive curvature.  Among the topics to be studied in                  
              measurable dynamics are restricted orbit equivalence, non-singular             
              and rational joinings, and the construction of natural smooth                  
              models of measurable systems.                                                  
                   This research group will study dynamical systems. The notion              
              of a dynamical system is a very general one.  The idea is just that            
              the system must evolve in time in some way.  The object is to learn            
              things of a general nature about the dynamics in the hope of                   
              classifying large families of these systems.  The dynamical systems            
              under consideration often behave chaotically over large time                   
              periods even when they are completely predictable.  To understand              
              how nevertheless to extract knowledge in this case is one of the               
              most important problems facing science today.  This is one of the              
              ultimate goals in the study of dynamical systems.
