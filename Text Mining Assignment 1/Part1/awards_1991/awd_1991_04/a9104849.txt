Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study silicate growth from low                 
              temperature geologic fluids using sepiolite as an experimental                 
              analogue. Results will be extrapolated to natural systems in order             
              to determine the role of growth kinetics in the formation of                   
              magnesium-bearing silicates, clay minerals, and zeolites from low-             
              temperature natural waters.
