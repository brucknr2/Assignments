Abstract    :
                   This award will provide half of the funds necessary for the               
              acquisition of an electron microprobe which will serve a large                 
              number of faculty and students in the Department of Geology and                
              Geophysics at Rice University, as well as many other scientists and            
              engineers at the university and in the Houston, Texas regional                 
              scientific community. Rice University is committed to supply the               
              other half of the funding. This electron microprobe will replace               
              an eighteen year old electron microprobe, and will enable many of              
              the past users to have access to a state of the art instrument.                
                   The electron microprobe will be central to research in                    
              geologic areas such as mineralogy,petrology,geochemistry,tectonics,            
              and related fields.Examples of specific research areas include the             
              use of the mineral apatite as a tracer of fluid evolution in                   
              volcanics in Colorado and California, crystallization conditions               
              of volcanic rocks in Hawaii,condition and timing of deformation of             
              metamorphic rocks in several geographic areas,alteration of                    
              carbonate platform sediments in the Caribbean Sea and Indian Ocean.            
              Researches in all aspects of material sciences will be greatly                 
              aided by the availability of this instrument.
