Abstract    :
                   This project involves analysis of borehole temperature                    
              profiles, seeding evidence of climatic change over the past two                
              centuries.  The investigation will include (1) detailed analysis               
              of borehole temperature logs in data archives; (2) relogging of                
              boreholes from which temperature profiles were acquired more than              
              25 years ago, and analysis of the quarter century of change                    
              observed; and (3) an integration of results with similar research              
              being conducted in eastern Canada to enable a regional assessment              
              of surface temperature trends.
