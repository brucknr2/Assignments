Abstract    :
                   This is a project to develop algorithms for nonlinear                     
              programming, particularly problems with many variables, with an                
              emphasis on algorithms suitable for parallel computers.  The focus             
              is on Newton-like methods.  The research is motivated by earlier               
              success in developing algorithms and software for parallel                     
              unconstrained optimization.  The research is primarily aimed at                
              methods suitable for coarse-grained parallel computers, where each             
              processor is itself moderately powerful.  This includes existing               
              machines such as the Intel iPSC hypercube and the Sequent parallel             
              computers.                                                                     
                   Large-scale nonlinear programming problems arise frequently               
              in industrial, economic, and military applications, however                    
              nonlinear models can be difficult to solve.  This research aims to             
              produce easy-to-use, general purpose algorithms (and software) that            
              will make available the power of parallel computers to the users               
              of nonlinear models, extending the range of nonlinear programming              
              as a day-to-day modelling tool.//
