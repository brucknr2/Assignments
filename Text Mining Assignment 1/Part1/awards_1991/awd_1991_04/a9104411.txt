Abstract    :
              This project is a cultural resource assessment of the East Base                
              site on Stonington Island on the Antarctic Peninsula. East Base was            
              used as headquarters for two U.S. expeditions, The U.S. Antarctic              
              Service Expedition (1939-1941) and the Ronne Antarctic Research                
              Expedition (1947-1948). This was the first permanent U. S. base on             
              the Peninsula. East Base has been designated as a registered                   
              historic site. Because of its historical significance, two National            
              Park Service archaeologists have been assigned for two months to               
              carry out a documentation of East Base as it exists today and to               
              make recommendations for the protection of the site as an historic             
              monument. A final report will be available by September 30, 1991.              
              This cultural resource assessment is being carried out in                      
              connection with the Division of Polar Programs administered clean-             
              up of East Base which is planned for late February-Early March,                
              1991. A Memorandum of Agreement between the National Science                   
              Foundation and the National Park Service is the basis for this                 
              project.
