Abstract    :
              As understanding of the biology of these important organisms and               
              their complex metabolism increases rapidly from year to year, the              
              need for international gatherings such as those in Geneva and                  
              Chicago grows also.  A decision was therefore made that a third                
              symposium would be held in Trieste, Italy, under the auspices of               
              the University of Milan in 1991.                                               
                                                                                             
              The science of Pseudomonas has reached a maturity that speaks for              
              itself through the papers presented in the previous meetings.  The             
              field continues to expand.  Molecular biology is having an impact              
              on understanding of metabolic biotransformations in Pseudomonas,               
              its mechanisms of pathogenicity (in both humans and plants), and               
              its use in the exciting world of biotechnology.  As research                   
              blossoms into new discoveries, we will continue to enjoy this                  
              education and human development to further the cause of science and            
              technology worldwide as well as in the United States.
