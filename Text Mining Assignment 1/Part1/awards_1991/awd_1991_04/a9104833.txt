Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will measure fractionation factors for             
              oxygen isotopes between vapor and silicate glasses, melts, and                 
              crystals.  The results of this project will be applicable to the               
              interpretation of oxygen isotope compositions of cogenetic igneous             
              rocks in terms of petrogenetic processes and to developing a more              
              complete understanding of the compositional and structural factors             
              that influence the partitioning of oxygen isotopes among                       
              geological materials.
