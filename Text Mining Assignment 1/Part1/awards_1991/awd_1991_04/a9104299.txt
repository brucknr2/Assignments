Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at providing a foundation for the                        
              algorithms that are employed to approximate the eigenvalues of a               
              real nonsymmetric matrix.  Current software in the EISPACK and                 
              LAPACK subroutine libraries rely on variations of the shifted QR               
              algorithm.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The primary objective is to obtain an understanding                            
              of the global convergence properties of these algorithms                       
              and determine whether they succeed for a set of problems of                    
              full measure.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Computation of eigenvalues is required in the study of vibrations              
              and other problems involving differential equations.                           
              For many years the EISPACK subroutine library has been an                      
              effective resource for approximation of eigenvalues.                           
              While experience has shown the algorithms to be both reliable and              
              fast, there is no theoretical basis for their success.  This                   
              project involves the application of techniques from dynamical                  
              systems and complexity to analyze the established numerical                    
              software.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The principal goal is to either establish the validity of                      
              the current methods or to identify areas in which they are                     
              inadequate and devise a more efficient modification.
