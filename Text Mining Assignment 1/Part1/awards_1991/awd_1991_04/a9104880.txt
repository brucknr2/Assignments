Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A conference will be held at Cold Spring Harbor on the molecular               
              neurobiology of drosophila.  Approximately 150 international                   
              scientists will participate and support will be available to                   
              attract young scientists.  Topics to be discussed cover a number               
              of areas in neurobiology including neuronal determination, ion                 
              channels, neurotransmitter systems, sensory transduction and                   
              complex behavior.
