Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to study the abyssal ocean circulation with simple              
              numerical models and laboratory experiments in the context of the              
              Deep Basin Experiment (DBE), a comonent of the World Circulation               
              Experiment. The emphasis on the study is on how large-scale bottom             
              topography affects the strength and pattern of the deep                        
              circulation.
