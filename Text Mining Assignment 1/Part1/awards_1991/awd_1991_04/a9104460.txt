Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a proposal to study the relationship between the                       
              intermediate range order and physical properties of new                        
              chalcogenide glasses. Neutron scattering, nuclear quadrapole                   
              resonance spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulation, and Raman               
              spectroscopy will be used to map the intermediate as well as the               
              short range order to the physical properties of these novel                    
              materials. The research will also include the study of the                     
              frequency dependence of ionic conductivities and NMR spin-lattice              
              relaxation times in thioborate glasses. This portion of the study              
              is aimed to resolve the discrepancy between the activation energies            
              for conductivity and relaxation. It is envisioned that the                     
              information gained through this research will enable the                       
              engineering of properties of new high technology glasses and                   
              amorphous materials.
