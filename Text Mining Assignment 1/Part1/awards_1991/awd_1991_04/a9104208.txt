Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a naturally occurring toxin, specifically                  
              blocks the function of sodium channels by underlying the                       
              electrical excitability in nerve and muscle.  Animals poisoned by              
              this paralytic poison lose the ability to control skeletal and                 
              visceral muscles and eventually die.  The investigation is                     
              designed to characterize the sodium channel receptor which binds               
              to tetrodotoxin.  Sodium channels in different species differ in               
              their ability to bind TTX.  Comparisons of the molecular                       
              structure of the binding sites in different species will be made               
              to determine the specific component responsible for the intensive              
              binding properties of the receptor.  Biochemical and                           
              electrophysiological techniques will be used to determine the                  
              structure of the receptor.  Once the receptor has been                         
              identified, it will be possible to develop pharmacological agents              
              targeted specifically for TTX, leading to the development of a                 
              new class of anesthetics.
