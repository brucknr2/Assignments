Abstract    :
              The lignin degradative system (LDS) of the white rot                           
              basidiomycetous fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium is capable of               
              degrading the plant cell wall polymer, lignin, and a range of                  
              aromatic pollutants.  The major components of this nonspecific                 
              oxidative system are two extracellular heme-containing peroxidases,            
              manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP).  The LDS               
              is expressed during secondary metabolic growth, the onset of which             
              is triggered by limiting nutrient nitrogen.  Recently, we                      
              discovered that MnP expression is also regulated at the level of               
              gene transcription by Mn ion and heat shock and the primary goal               
              of the proposed project is to elucidate on the molecular level the             
              mechanisms of Mn regulation of mnp gene transcription.  Isolation              
              and analysis of mutants and titration with promoter copies will be             
              utilized to determine the type of regulation.  The promoter regions            
              of P. chrysosporium mnp genes will be analyzed to determine the                
              sequences responsible for Mn and heat shock regulation of                      
              transcription, using promoter-reporter constructs, deletion                    
              analysis and synthetic promoter elements.  DNaseI footprinting and             
              gel mobility shift assays will be used to assay putative DNA-                  
              binding transcription factors, and the factors will be isolated.               
              A possible requirement for Mn in post-transcriptional events will              
              be examined.
