Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project involving Cornell              
              University and Bogazici University is in the general area of                   
              fractional supersymmetries.  Project funding will allow Prof. Omer             
              Oguz of Bogazici University the opportunity to work for two months             
              in the laboratory of Dr. S. H. Henry Tye at Cornell University as              
              well as enable Dr. P. C. Argyres of Cornell to work in Prof. Omer's            
              laboratory for two months. The collaborative research will                     
              concentrate on the problems of gauging two-dimensional symmetries              
              and developing a geometrical picture of fractional supersymmetry               
              transformations.  Providing a geometrical picture of these                     
              symmetries would aid present efforts aimed at classifying two-                 
              dimensional critical systems.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This project in theoretical physics fulfills the program objective             
              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in               
              the United States and Turkey to combine complementary talents and              
              pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                 
              competence.
