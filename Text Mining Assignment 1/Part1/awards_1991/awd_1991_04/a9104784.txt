Abstract    :
                   Results of preliminary strontium, oxygen and carbon isotope               
              studies have revealed progressive cooling, and significant climatic            
              and oceanographic variability during the Maastrichtian.  Episodes              
              of marked increases in foraminiferal del 18O values correlate with             
              decreases in oceanic del 13C values, documented sea level                      
              regressions, and increases in seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the                 
              early to late and latest Maastrichtian.  The coincidence of these              
              events, and the similarity between Maastrichtian benthic                       
              foraminifera del 18O values and those of middle Eocene age                     
              associated with ice-rafted debris, suggest that the Maastrichtian              
              isotopic variations could be related to glacio-eustatic phenomena.             
                   The research proposed will investigate and document the                   
              climatic and oceanographic history of the high and mid-latitude                
              South Atlantic and Indian Oceans from the latest early                         
              Maastrichtian to the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary based on                     
              foraminiferal oxygen and carbon isotope measurements, and                      
              foraminiferal quantitative analyses.  We will attempt to determine             
              the effect of climatic/oceanographic changes on foraminiferal                  
              populations.  Stratigraphic correlation of deep-sea sections will              
              be enhanced by integration of biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy             
              and chemostratigraphy.  This data set is expected to provide a                 
              basis for climatic reconstruction of the Late Cretaceous including             
              development of new climatic models that are not based on the                   
              assumption of uniform, warm, and equable climatic conditions during            
              the Cretaceous.
