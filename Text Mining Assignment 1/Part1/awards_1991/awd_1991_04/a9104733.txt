Abstract    :
                   This award supports a series of workshops concerned with                  
              various aspects of representation theory.  The topics to be                    
              considered include Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras, enveloping              
              algebras and quantized analogs, Hecke algebras, graded algebras,               
              algebras of differential operators, noetherian and artinian                    
              algebras, and classical orders.                                                
                   This award supports a series of summer workshops in                       
              algebraic representation theory, to be held during the summers of              
              92-94 at the University of Washington.  There will be a series of              
              lectures by visiting senior algebraists, opportunities for                     
              discussions of mathematics of mutual interest, and collaborative               
              research by various combinations of the mathematicians present.                
              These workshops will emphasize the involvement of younger                      
              researchers and graduate students.
