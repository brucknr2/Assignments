Abstract    :
              A new theoretical model has been developed to analyze laboratory               
              experiments and field measurements of fallout from volcanic                    
              eruption plumes.  The model is based on the sedimentation from                 
              lateral gravity currents which develop at the top of plumes in                 
              stratified environments.  It allows for the prediction of fallout              
              patterns from plumes such as volcanic eruptions or black smoker                
              vents.  This project seeks to develop a general model of volcanic              
              ash fallout from explosive eruptions which utilizes this new                   
              theory.  A major task of the work will be to develop a computer                
              model which can incorporate the effect of wind transport with the              
              theoretical sedimentation relationship.  It will involve                       
              collaboration with British scientists who have been concerned                  
              with this problem.
