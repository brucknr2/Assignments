Abstract    :
              Understanding magmatic processes requires detailed knowledge of                
              the thermodynamics and kinetics of crystallization and melting in              
              silicate systems.  This research will focus on measuring the heat              
              capacities of both simple model silicate melts and of molten                   
              rocks.  The enthalpies of fusion of important rock-forming                     
              minerals will be determined.  The calorimeter will be used to                  
              directly measure enthalpy release in crystallizing basalts as a                
              function of cooling rate, and to relate this to observed crystal               
              modes from quench experiments.  This study should greatly expand               
              both the data base and the fundamental understanding of the                    
              interrelationships among thermodynamic and kinetic factors during              
              crystallization.
