Abstract    :
                   This is an investigation of a new importance sampling                     
              technique called twisted simulation.  In the i.i.d. case it                    
              corresponds to simulating the events of interest via an                        
              exponentially shifted version of the direct simulation probability             
              measures.  In the finite dimensional Markov chains of i.i.d. random            
              variables the method is optimal over a large class of importance               
              sampling distributions in the sense of minimizing the asymptotic               
              variance of the estimates.  The work may be extended to more useful            
              probability models, in particular Markov additive processes and                
              multidimensional event sets.  The theoretical extensions require               
              different analysis techniques than have been used previously.  The             
              techniques and tools involved will be sophisticated and involved,              
              bust due to the conjectured optimality of the method, the effort               
              expended on these theoretical investigations should have                       
              substantial payoff in applications.  The methods promise to provide            
              a rigorous structure for the pursuit of the study of simulation of             
              systems with memory.
