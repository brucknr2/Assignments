Abstract    :
                This research continues three seismotectonic investigations.                 
              In the first study, VLBI data are being used to determine                      
              regional scale crustal deformation at the North American-Pacific               
              plate boundary.  In the second, synthetic earthquake catalogs are              
              being developed using a model of strain accumulation on fault                  
              segments and their interactive failure.  In the third, geologic                
              data are being used to investigate the evolution of the Santa                  
              Cruz mountains and to relate this evolution to North American-                 
              Pacific plate motion.  The goal of the project is to develop                   
              quantitative pictures of coseismic and interseismic strain                     
              accumulation and release associated with major faults in western               
              North America.  This research is a component of the National                   
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
