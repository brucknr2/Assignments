Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award will support a program whose aim is to enable                  
              geoscientists to make full use of the next generation synchrotron              
              radiation source currently being constructed at Argonne National               
              Laboratory.  The extremely great brightness, the high energies,                
              and the large energy range of synchrotron radiation make it                    
              possible to study and analyze the chemistry, structure, and phase              
              relations of materials, many of which could not be analyzed                    
              precisely before synchrotron radiation techniques became                       
              available.  Geoscientists want to be able to quickly seize upon                
              research opportunities that will exist when the synchrotron                    
              radiation source at the Argonne Laboratory becomes operational.                
                   This  award will be used to fund continued planning                       
              activities required for detailed design and development of                     
              beamlines and experimental stations to be used by earth                        
              scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory.  The award will                 
              also support a hands-on workshop to train a new generation of                  
              earth science investigators in synchrotron radiation techniques.
