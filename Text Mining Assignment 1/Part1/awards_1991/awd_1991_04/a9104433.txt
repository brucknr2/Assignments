Abstract    :
                   Professor Vakilian's project involves a number of problems in             
              statistical mechanics.  One set deals with the specific heat for               
              layered aperiodic Ising models.  The solution of this problem could            
              lead to the discovery of a new phase of matter intermediate between            
              random and quasicrystalline forms.  Additional problems deal with              
              trace maps of aperiodic dynamical systems and one-dimensional                  
              aperiodic Schrodinger operators.                                               
                   The general area of research of Professor Vakilian is                     
              mathematical physics.  In this research project, the principal                 
              investigator will concentrate on the mathematical aspects of models            
              of matter which are not regular but not completely random.  This               
              type of matter is typified by the quasicrystalline forms recently              
              found in nature.
