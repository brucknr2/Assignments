Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant                   
              biology for two years.  The project entitled "Characterization of              
              potyviral RNA replication" is to be carried out in the                         
              laboratories of John Shaw at University of Kentucky.  The Ph.D.                
              training of this Fellow was in the area of light regulation of                 
              gene expression in barley.  The focus of the postdoctoral project              
              is the effects of viral (tobacco vein mottling virus) gene                     
              expression on chloroplast activities.                                          
                                                                                             
              The postdoctoral fellowships in plant biology are designed to                  
              increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant                
              biology.
