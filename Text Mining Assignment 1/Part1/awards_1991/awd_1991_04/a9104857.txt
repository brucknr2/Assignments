Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Progesterone is a steroid hormone that is important in the                     
              menstrual cycle and in pregnancy.  Steroid hormones are small                  
              molecules that work by binding to certain types of protein in the              
              cell, called receptors, and changing their shape.  This somehow                
              causes the cell to produce different proteins and / or different               
              amounts of certain proteins.  It is these changes in the kinds and             
              amounts of proteins produced that ultimately cause the biological              
              effects of the hormone.  This research project is trying to answer             
              a very basic question:  what does binding of that small molecule,              
              the steroid hormone, do to the shape of the receptor?  There are               
              two important reasons for focusing on this question.  First,                   
              binding of the steroid is the first event in what is called signal             
              transduction - i.e., converting the steroid hormone "signal" to the            
              biological response.  Second, not all steroid-like molecules that              
              bind to a steroid receptor produce the same responses.  So there               
              must be a difference in the binding of different small molecules               
              to the receptor and the changes that they produce in the shape of              
              the receptor that causes different responses.  Similar experiments             
              will be performed with the estrogen receptor, which is a protein               
              that binds estrogen instead of progesterone.  By using biochemical             
              techniques to investigate these changes,  this research will                   
              produce a better understanding of how steroids work.//
