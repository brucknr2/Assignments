Abstract    :
                   Two recent independent studies, one in the SE corner of South             
              Dakota, and the other in north central Kansas, indicate a striking             
              departure in the stress regime west of the Midcontinent Rift (MCR)             
              from that established in Wisconsin-Illinois and more eastern states            
              and assumed until now to prevail throughout the Midcontinent stress            
              province.  Near-surface in situ stress measurements in South Dakota            
              and a focal mechanism solution of an earthquake in Kansas (depth               
              1.3 km or greater) both indicate a 90o rotation in the direction               
              of the maximum horizontal stress which is uniformly northeastern               
              in all the previous Midcontinent measurements.  The new findings               
              are supported by two earlier focal mechanism solutions suggesting              
              west-northwest stress direction.  However, this fascinating and                
              important observation, which may require a redistribution of the               
              stress provinces in the continental U.S., is incomplete in that                
              stress magnitudes representative of the upper crust are difficult              
              to ascertain from near-surface tests, and are impossible to                    
              determine from focal mechanism solutions.  The goal of this project            
              is to verify the unexpected results west of the MCR, and complement            
              them with credible estimates of the magnitudes of in situ principal            
              stresses, by conducting a comprehensive series of hydraulic                    
              fracturing stress measurements in basement granite at depths of                
              about 600 m using the existing Quimby, Iowa Scientific hole.
