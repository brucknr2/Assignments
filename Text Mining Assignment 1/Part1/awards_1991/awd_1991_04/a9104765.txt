Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will develop models and conduct computer            
              simulations of processes that take place in high-temperature                   
              metamorphic rocks known as granulites.  The models will incorporate            
              simultaneous operation of both net transfer and exchange reactions,            
              as well as intracrystalline diffusion in various zoned minerals.               
              The goal is to reproduce the type of zoning and reaction histories             
              observed in natural rocks.  This will aid geologists in                        
              interpreting the histories of these rocks.
