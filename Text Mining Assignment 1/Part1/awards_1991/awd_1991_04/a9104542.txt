Abstract    :
              Research is proposed to further understand the structure,                      
              function, evolution and the regulation of synthesis of                         
              antinutrient proteinase inhibitor proteins that are present in                 
              plant tissues as defensive proteins against invading insects and               
              pathogens.  The proteins were first identified, isolated, and                  
              characterized in the PI's laboratory, and were subsequently found              
              to be synthesized in potato, tomato, and alfalfa leaves in                     
              response to insect attacks or to severe mechanical wounding.  As               
              part of studies of wound signal transduction systems that                      
              regulate the expression of proteinase inhibitor genes in plants,               
              the PI's lab has isolated and characterized several proteinase                 
              inhibitor genes from tomato and potato plants.  With these genes               
              they have been able to study the structure, organization, and                  
              regulation of proteinase inhibitor gene families that are                      
              expressed in response to both developmental and environmental                  
              signals.  They have recently discovered an 18 amino acid                       
              polypeptide as a new signaling molecule for the proteinase                     
              inhibitors, and have found a volatile signalling molecule for the              
              inhibitors, and have found a volatile signalling molecule for the              
              inhibitors, methyl jasmonate. In the interest of practical                     
              applications, several proteinase inhibitor genes have been used                
              by the PI successfully to genetically engineer plants to improve               
              their defense against predators.
