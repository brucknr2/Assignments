Abstract    :
              Professor James B. Anderson is supported by a grant from the                   
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to explore                     
              Green's Function Quantum Monte Carlo techniques for studying                   
              chemical systems. Professor Anderson has been using massively                  
              parallel computers such as the CM-2 connection machine to                      
              perform Green's Function Monte Carlo calculations on simple                    
              triatomic systems such as the reaction between hydrogen atoms                  
              and hydrogen molecules.  In his recent calculations on the                     
              complete 4-body hydrogen molecule calculation, he was able to                  
              achieve a sustained speed of 1.5 gigaflop on a 65K processor                   
              CM-2 computer, with an overall accuracy of 0.006 Kcal/mole.                    
              Anderson will study the reaction surfaces for the hydrogen                     
              exchange reaction using the same approach, with the                            
              expectation of accuracies better than 0.01 Kcal/mole over the                  
              entire potential energy surface.  He also expects to study the                 
              potential energy surface for the flourine atom plus hydrogen                   
              molecule reaction.  Other systems to be studied include                        
              excitons in semiconductor crystallites, extended molecular                     
              systems consisting of small polyatomic molecules, and clusters                 
              of helium atoms.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              The calculations which will be done in this project are                        
              important because they form an exact benchmark against which                   
              other electronic structure theoretical models can be tested.
