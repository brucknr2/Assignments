Abstract    :
                   Professor Stanton's research project will apply noncommutative            
              harmonic analysis and operator determinants to gain an                         
              understanding of holomorphic torsion on Hermitian locally symmetric            
              manifolds.  This effort, in collaboration with H. Moscovici, will              
              focus on the current phase of the project which is to construct                
              zeta functions associated to general rank spaces and to evaluate               
              their special values in geometric terms.  Another project, begun               
              jointly with A. Knapp, will investigate certain differential                   
              operators on globally symmetric manifolds.  This project will                  
              attempt to give a representation theoretic characterization of the             
              solution space of these operators thereby resolving a conjecture of            
              Vogan.                                                                         
                   A manifold is a generalization to higher dimensions of a                  
              smooth two dimensional surface.  For example, the curved space-time            
              continuum is a four dimensional manifold.  Professor Stanton's                 
              research is aimed at understanding these geometric objects by                  
              exploiting connections with certain partial differential equations.
