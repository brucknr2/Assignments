Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ureide production is a specialized form of nitrogen metabolism that            
              is very prominent in soybean and certain other legumes.  Ureides               
              are nitrogen-rich compounds that are important in transporting                 
              nitrogen from one part of the plant to another.  In this study we              
              are conducting basic research to examine the expression and                    
              distribution of allantoinase, an enzyme involved in both the                   
              production and utilization of ureides in soybean.  These studies               
              will identify the cellular structures involved in ureide production            
              in germinating soybean seeds and will clarify the importance of                
              ureide metabolism in development and establishment of the soybean              
              seedling.//
