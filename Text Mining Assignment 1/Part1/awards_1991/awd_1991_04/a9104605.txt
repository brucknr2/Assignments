Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will develop the method of 3d                      
              electron crystallography for routine analysis of mineral                       
              structures from high resolution electron micrographs. They will                
              initially study rhombohedral carbonates, calcium-aluminum                      
              pyroxene, and perovskite, as well as high-pressure phases                      
              produced in the diamond anvil cell.
