Abstract    :
                   The evolution of fine-grained pelitic rocks from early                    
              diagenesis through low grade metamorphism is being studied with an             
              emphasis on techniques of scanning and scanning transmission                   
              electron microscopy (SEM/STEM).  The textures, compositions and                
              structures of minerals from sequences of samples representing the              
              ranges of a variety of processes are each being characterized in               
              order to distinguish the changes that characterize the processes.              
              Specific projects include: (a) characterization of the smectite to             
              illite transformation.  (b) evolution of the composition, defect-              
              state and crystal dimensions of illite, in part to determine the               
              origins of changes in illite "crystallinity."  (c) evolution of                
              changes in chlorite leading to changes in chlorite crystallinity.              
              (d) prograde hydrothermal alteration of MORB with emphasis on the              
              evolution of mixed-layer relations of trioctahedral                            
              phyllosilicates.  (e) prograde evolution of trioctahedral mixed-               
              layer phyllosilicates in pelites.  (f) evolution of Na/K                       
              dioctahedral micas.  (g) contact metamorphism of pelites.  (h)                 
              formation of homogenized shales with chlorite/mica "stacks."  (i)              
              relation between XRD patterns and mixed-layer clay sequences.  The             
              research addresses the fundamental question as to how fine-grained             
              sediments become metamorphic rocks.
