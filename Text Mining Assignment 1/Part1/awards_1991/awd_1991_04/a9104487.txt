Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will address mathematical                      
              questions in several different branches of statistical mechanics               
              and condensed matter physics.  First, she will investigate both                
              equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of some simple                      
              classical systems.  Second, she will study collective phenomena                
              in some rather simple quantum systems, including both quantum                  
              spin models and systems of particles with anomalous statistics.                
              All the questions she will address concern the behavior of                     
              systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, usually                     
              infinite.  The mathematical methods to be developed to study                   
              these systems are rooted in probability theory and analysis, but               
              also make use of dynamical systems, differential equations, group              
              theory and numerical methods.
