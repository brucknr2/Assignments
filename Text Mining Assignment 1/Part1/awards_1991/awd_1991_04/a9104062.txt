Abstract    :
                   This research project addresses problems in computational                 
              learning theory, the investigation of algorithms and formal methods            
              for various natural and artificial learning systems.  The following            
              specific topics are addressed in this project:                                 
                        the complexity of on-line learning with an oblivious                 
                        environment;                                                         
                        the power of randomization for on-line learning;                     
                        design of space-efficient algorithms for on-line learning;           
                        design and analysis of error-tolerant on-line learning               
                        algorithms;                                                          
                        on-line learning of definitions in fragments of first order          
                        predicate logic;                                                     
                        analysis of the computational power of common computational          
                        neural network models;                                               
                        design and analysis of learning algorithms for concept               
                        classes on neural networks of depth 2.
