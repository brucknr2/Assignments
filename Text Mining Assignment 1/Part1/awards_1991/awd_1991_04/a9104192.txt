Abstract    :
                   Professor Sperber will study exponential sums using methods               
              from p-adic analysis and p-adic cohomology.  He intends to produce             
              better congruence estimates for these sums and relate them to                  
              singularities and Hodge theory.  The goal is to obtain sharp                   
              effective estimates on the size of exponential sums.                           
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
