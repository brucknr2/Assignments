Abstract    :
                   Professor Johnson will study questions of rigidity and the                
              existence of certain anomalous behaviors in the class of unimodal              
              maps with a negative Schwarzian derivative and a nondegenerate                 
              critical point.  He will work on the question of whether if two                
              maps in this class are conjugate then they are quasi-symmetrically             
              conjugate and whether von Neumann's type III can occur in this                 
              class.  He will also study topological and measure theoretic                   
              dependence on parameter values.                                                
                   Professor Johnson's project concerns a very elementary                    
              dynamical system where, surprisingly, there is still much that is              
              unknown.  He will study a function on the unit interval of the real            
              line into itself and its iterations as a model of more complicated             
              dynamical systems.  His main interest is in classifying these                  
              functions.  Here two are considered in the same class when a                   
              stretching and shrinking of parts of the interval (keeping the                 
              length constant) brings one map to the other. His research will add            
              to our knowledge about this elementary but important dynamical                 
              system.
