Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor A. Zelevinsky               
              to work on applications of multivariate hypergeometric function to             
              algebraic, geometric and combinatorial structures.  In particular,             
              he intends to use these techniques to study algebraic varieties,               
              convex polytopes and constructive representation theory.                       
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
