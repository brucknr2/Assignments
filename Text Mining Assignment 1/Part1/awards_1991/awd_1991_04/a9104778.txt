Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under certain conditions, cells of chemotactic strains of the                  
              bacterium Escherichia coli aggregate in spots or stripes                       
              distributed in symmetrical arrays. Each aggregate contains a                   
              large number of cells that have migrated toward a discrete locus               
              in response to a signal generated by the cells themselves.                     
              This signal is produced when cells are grown on defined media and              
              exposed to intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle or to                 
              hydrogen peroxide. It is a chemical of low molecular weight                    
              sensed by the aspartate receptor. Dr. Berg proposes 1) to                      
              identify this chemical, 2) to characterize its mode of                         
              production, and 3) to develop a mathematical formulation that                  
              will help explain why patterns are formed with such varied                     
              geometries. This is a cross field endeavor that links sensory                  
              transduction, responses to stress, and secretion of signal                     
              molecules to problems of biological self organization. It does so              
              with a model system readily amenable to genetic and biochemical                
              manipulation.
