Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the mechanisms of the phase              
              transformations in magnesium and magnesium-iron olivine under a                
              wide range of pressure and temperature conditions, employing multi             
              anvil apparatus and transmission electron microscope techniques.               
              The results will have important implications for understanding the             
              dynamics of the upper part of the Earth's mantle, including the                
              rheological behavior of subducting oceanic slabs and the mechanisms            
              of deep focus earthquakes.
