Abstract    :
                   The research is in the areas of knot theory and 3-                        
              dimensional manifolds.  One of the problems Thompson will work on              
              is the property-P conjecture.   A knot in the 3-sphere is said                 
              to have property P if no non-trivial surgery on the knot yields a              
              homotopy 3-sphere.  It has long been conjectured that all non-                 
              trivial knots in the 3-sphere have property P.  Gordon and Luecke              
              have recently shown that non-trivial surgery on a non-trivial                  
              knot cannot yield the 3-sphere itself.  There remains the                      
              possibility that one could do surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere                
              and obtain a counter-example to the Poincare conjecture.  The                  
              suggested approach to this problem involves a generalization of                
              work of Gabai on sutured manifolds, as well as considering the                 
              equivalent problem of whether one can do surgery on a knot in a                
              fake 3-sphere and obtain S3.  In addition, recent work with                    
              Scharlemann has suggested several interesting questions about                  
              imbedded finite graphs in 3-manifolds.  Thompson will try to                   
              generalize their work characterizing unknotted planar graphs in                
              S3 to arbitrary finite graphs in the 3-sphere.                                 
                   These are fundamental questions about three-manifolds.  The               
              fact that they are open points up how much we still do not know                
              about three-dimensional manifolds.  This is so despite the fact                
              that we live in one, and so such topological questions might even              
              have cosmological significance.
