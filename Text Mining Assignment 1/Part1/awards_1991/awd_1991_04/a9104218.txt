Abstract    :
              This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant                   
              biology for two years.  The project entitled "Characterization of              
              GT-1, a plant nuclear factor which mediates light responsive                   
              regulation" is to be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Nam-Hai              
              Chua at Rockefeller University.  The applicant received her Ph.D.              
              training in the area of prokaryotic molecular biology.  In her                 
              postdoctoral training, she completely switches her field to plant              
              molecular biology and focuses on the molecular mechanisms of                   
              light regulation of gene expression in tobacco and Arabidopsis.                
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Plant Biology are designed to                  
              increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant                
              biology.
