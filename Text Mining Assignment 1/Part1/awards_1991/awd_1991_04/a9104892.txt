Abstract    :
                   Recently completed studies on the morphology, fine-structure,             
              taphonomy, and functional morphology of stalks of living crinoids              
              provide the necessary information to reexamine the morphology and              
              function of stalks of Paleozoic crinoids.  Patterns of stalk                   
              morphology will be documented by describing the distribution of                
              connective tissue (ligaments) in the stalks of Paleozoic taxa.                 
              This will be done by examining the microstructure (stereom) of                 
              columnals, and by interpreting taphonomic patterns of fragmented               
              stalks.  The morphological data will then be used in a functional              
              analysis of crinoid stalks, with the stalk modeled as a cantilever             
              beam.  A modified model for large beam deflections which we have               
              developed and tested will allow us to examine how different stalk              
              architectures responded to different energy regimes.  These results            
              will serve not only as a paleoecological tool, to reinterpret, for             
              example, the distributional patterns of crinoids among different               
              environments, but should also provide new characters (types and                
              patterns of positioning of connective tissue) for testing                      
              hypotheses of relationship among higher crinoid taxa.
