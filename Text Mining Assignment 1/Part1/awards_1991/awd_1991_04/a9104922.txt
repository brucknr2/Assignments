Abstract    :
                   This is a 2 year project aimed towards developing a                       
              continuous, absolutely dated Holocene tree-ring chronology from                
              live and sub-fossil huon pine located in western Tasmania,                     
              Australia.  Based on the known ages of sampled living trees (>1000             
              years old) and a series of overlapping radiocarbon dates from                  
              recovered sub-fossil logs, all from the Stanley River in western               
              Tasmania, tree-ring specimens are in hand for developing a                     
              chronology almost 3000 years in length.  In addition, other sub-               
              fossil logs recovered from deposits at the Stanley River have                  
              radiocarbon dates that extend back beyond the present radiocarbon              
              calibration curve derived from Northern Hemisphere trees.                      
              Consequently, there is the proven potential for a 9-10,000 year                
              tree-ring chronology from Tasmania that would include the                      
              climatically interesting Hypsithermal warm period (ca. 7-9,000 BP),            
              with the realistic prospect of it eventually extending back to the             
              Younger Dryas cold event (ca. 10-11,000 BP) and the glacial-                   
              interglacial transition (ca. 13-14,000 BP).                                    
                   We will exploit to the fullest extent possible the Stanley                
              River sub-fossil wood now in hand, sample additional logs from that            
              locality, and explore Tasmania for other huon pine sites in an                 
              effort to locate pre-9,000 BP wood for extending the radiocarbon               
              calibration curve.  In the process, we will also develop a network             
              of 1000 year long modern tree-ring chronologies for Tasmania and,              
              if possible, New Zealand that will be used to reconstruct past                 
              climate in that sector.  The precisely dated wood produced by this             
              project will be available for other scientific studies, including              
              stable isotope and carbon-14 analyses, in order to make this                   
              project as scientifically productive as possible.
