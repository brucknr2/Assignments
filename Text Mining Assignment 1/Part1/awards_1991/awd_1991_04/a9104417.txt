Abstract    :
              This award is for support of research to study the portion                     
              of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet which feeds in to the Ross                     
              Ice Shelf.  Radar soundings by both airborne and                               
              ground-based systems comprise the necessary elements of this                   
              research.  These activities are an essential part of the                       
              Siple Coast Project and the new WAIS initiative which have                     
              as goals: 1) Determination of the configuration and mass                       
              balance of the Siple Coast region of the West Antarctic ice                    
              sheet, 2) Determination of the physical controls of ice flow                   
              in this region, and 3) Prediction of the future behavior of                    
              this region using numerical models.  These models will be                      
              enhanced by an understanding of the relative motion between                    
              the surface and bed in the grounded region just upstream of                    
              the grounding line.
