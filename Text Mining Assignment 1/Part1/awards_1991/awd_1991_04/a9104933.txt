Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is focused on two key enzymes involved in antibiotic             
              (ansatrienin) synthesis and one that plays a role in fatty acid                
              synthesis and oxidation in Streptomyces collinus.  Continued                   
              biochemical characterization and cloning of one reductase will be              
              accompanied by efforts to isolate, purify and characterize a second            
              such enzyme, but here one that is connected with primary                       
              metabolism. Cloning of this enzyme is expected to follow, as are               
              studies of a second of the enoyl reductases.  Sequence studies                 
              should permit a comparison of the primary and secondary metabolism             
              enzymes and lead to a better understanding of the                              
              interrelationships of the relevant genes.  //
