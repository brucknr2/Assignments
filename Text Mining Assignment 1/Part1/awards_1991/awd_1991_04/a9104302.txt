Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding for a technician's                    
              position in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University            
              of Texas-Austin. The funds will be used to support a technician who            
              will assist in the operation of the Department's mass spectrometer             
              laboratory. The mass spectrometer laboratory at Texas provides                 
              isotope analysis for a group of active researchers in the                      
              Department of Geological Sciences as well as off-campus                        
              collaborators. The laboratory's capabilities are needed in a range             
              of research projects in tectonics, igneous and metamorphic                     
              petrogenesis, sedimentary geochemistry, hydrology, and ore genesis.
