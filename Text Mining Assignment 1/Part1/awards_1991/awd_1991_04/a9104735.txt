Abstract    :
                This research will develop a nonlinear velocity inversion                    
              technique that accounts for curved seismic ray paths through                   
              lateral discontinuities.  Seismic imaging of active fault traces               
              in southern California carried out by previous projects has led to             
              the description of non-vertical dips for the Garlock and Hosgri                
              faults.  However, migration of these diffractions into a true depth            
              section is impeded by lack of knowledge of the surrounding lateral             
              velocity variations, which this research will address.  Application            
              of this inversion prior to the migration of survey data crossing               
              earthquake faults in southern California will help to resolve                  
              ambiguities in regional seismic hazard.  This research is a                    
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
