Abstract    :
                   This award provides for half the funds needed to acquire a so-            
              called Total Station, which is a theodolite for measuring angles,              
              a ranging device for measuring distances,and a minicomputer to                 
              compute the data in the field. Using a Total Station it is possible            
              to construct very accurate topographic maps,and other kinds of maps            
              of surficial features on the earth's surface. The PIs intend to use            
              this Total Station as a critically important part of their active              
              neotectonic research program; they also plan to use it in the                  
              teaching of undergraduate and graduate courses. This device is now             
              considered to be necessary for neotectonics studies where it is                
              important to gather efficiently and accurately data recording                  
              positions and elevations on the earth's surface. MIT is committed              
              to providing the additional funds required for this acquisition.
