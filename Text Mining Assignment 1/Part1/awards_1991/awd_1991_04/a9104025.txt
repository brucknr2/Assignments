Abstract    :
                   Funds are requested for an investigation of the polypeptide               
              content of the shells of Recent, Pleistocene, and Pliocene                     
              brachiopod genera in an attempt to assess the potential and                    
              limitations of serotaxonomy and polypeptide analysis in extant and             
              fossil shells of varying age.  We plan to use immunological methods            
              to see if differences in cross-reactivity can be detected between              
              these brachiopod genera, and between their superfamilies.                      
                   Preliminary work shows that these brachiopods have amino acids            
              present as peptides within their shell material.  It is proposed               
              to investigate these remnant macromolecules in the shells of                   
              brachiopods of different ages.  Amino acids from the fossil shells             
              will be analysed for enantiomorphy as a test for recent                        
              contamination.                                                                 
                   Work on extant material will serve to fine-tune our methods,              
              and work on Pleistocene and Pliocene samples should help us measure            
              the increasing effect of time and diagenesis in the anticipated                
              destruction of shell protein, and should show whether similar work             
              on increasingly older fossil shells is likely to prove worthwhile.
