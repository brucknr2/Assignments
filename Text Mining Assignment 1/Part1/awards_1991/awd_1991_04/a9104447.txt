Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An investigation of the geomagnetic and tectonic implications of               
              a new geomagnetic polarity time scale for the late Cretaceous                  
              and Cenozoic developed by the PIs from a global magnetic                       
              anomaly data. The objectives of the study are to further search                
              for small variations in the magnetic signal between anomalies and              
              to statistically analyze polarity dependent bias.
