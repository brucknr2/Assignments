              visit is 1) to establish closer research                                       
              interactions between the Disaster Control                                      
              Research Center at Tohoku University (and                                      
              especially the Tsunami Engineering Department                                  
              within this Center) and tsunami researchers                                    
              in the United States, 2) acquire hard-to-                                      
              obtain field data and historical data on                                       
              tsunamis (seismic sea waves) which could                                       
              identify research needs to address the                                         
              potential tsunami threat to coastal areas in                                   
              the U.S., 3) to facilitate the interchange of                                  
              information on tsunamis between Professor Yeh                                  
              and researchers in Japan, 4) to discuss with                                   
              Professor Nobuo Shuto (a world renowned                                        
              tsunami engineering researcher) possible                                       
              research cooperation, and 6) to visit coastal                                  
              sites subjected to past tsunami runup and
