Abstract    :
                   This research examines in detail a variety of scientific                  
              questions where there is a natural expression of the phenomena or              
              of the search for their explanation in terms of a sequential                   
              process.  Such problems arise in the study of the human genome,                
              particularly in connection with possible sequencing errors which               
              may be present in the various copies.  There are also many                     
              examples in quality control problems, particularly in case of                  
              serial dependence.  The common mathematical thread in these                    
              particular examples is the derivation of an accurate solution                  
              from a combination of several sources of information each of                   
              which may be subject to noise.
