Abstract    :
              Hydrous components have been identified in a variety of upper                  
              mantel minerals normally considered to be anhydrous.  In this                  
              study, the concentration of these hydrous components will be                   
              determined in co-existing major rock forming minerals from the                 
              upper mantle, and inter-mineral partitioning of OH will be                     
              determined.  The bulk of OH content of the nominally anhydrous                 
              mineral reservoir of mantle hydrogen and its geological                        
              importance in different upper mantle regimes will be assessed.                 
              This work should help in the better understandint of processes of              
              magma genesis and the global geochemical cycles.
