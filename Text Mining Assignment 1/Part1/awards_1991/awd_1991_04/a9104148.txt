Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds to cover half the cost of a CHNS-O              
              Analyzer System (including peripherals such as additional sample               
              drums, organic and carbonate carbon kit,laboratory start-up                    
              materials such as gas regulator valves for gas tanks,gas lines,a               
              Compu Add 3165 computer and a printer). The University of Michigan             
              is committed to provide funds for the other half of the cost.                  
                   This equipment will enable a large number of faculty and                  
              students to analyze thousands of samples per year for organic and              
              inorganic C, oxidized and reduced S,N,H, and O. Acquisition of the             
              CHNS-O analyzer will permit rapid, accurate analyses of all these              
              elements in a variety of sample types and on small, 5-10 mg                    
              samples, benefitting projects ranging from Precambrian crustal                 
              genesis to alteration of the modern sea floor, from carbonate                  
              geochemistry to paleooceanographic reconstructions.
