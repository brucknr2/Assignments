Abstract    :
                The goal of the proposed program is to expand research in                    
              engineering at the University of the District of Columbia.                     
              This program is designed to interest minority students in                      
              research and to stimulate their interest beyond the                            
              experiments and theoretical analyses which focus on the                        
              mechanical properties of vascular tissue.  Tests include                       
              tube inflation, torsion, residual stress/strain                                
              determination, and uniaxial strip tension test.
