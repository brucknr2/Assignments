Abstract    :
              This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant                   
              biology for two years.  The project entitled "Molecular genetic                
              analysis of the chloroplast-encoded rpoA and rpoB genes of                     
              Chlamydomonas" is to be carried out in the laboratory of Dr.                   
              David Stern at Boyce Thompson Institute.  Dr. Sturm has received               
              her Ph.D. training working on RNA editing in the trypanosome                   
              mitochondria.  In her postdoctoral training, she will focus on                 
              the regulation of gene expression in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts.               
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Plant Biology are designed to                  
              increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant                
              biology.
