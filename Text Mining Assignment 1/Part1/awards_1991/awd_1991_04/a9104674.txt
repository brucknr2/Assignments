Abstract    :
                This research is to extend previous development of preliminary               
              global maps of mantle Rayleigh wave attenuation at different                   
              periods, showing evidence for the existence of a strong attenuation            
              in the depth range corresponding to the upper mantle low Q (high               
              attenuation) zone.  Data will be taken from 20 Geoscope (French)               
              stations and several IRIS (NSF-sponsored) stations.  The inversion             
              will be performed in two ways: attenuation maps alone, and                     
              simultaneous inversion of attenuation and velocity maps.  The                  
              resulting 3-dimensional models will provide new information on                 
              upper mantle temperature and viscosity distributions.  The goal is             
              to contribute new insight into convective processes in the upper               
              mantle.
