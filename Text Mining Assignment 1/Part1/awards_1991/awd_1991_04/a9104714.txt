Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study the effects of cation                   
              order/disorder relationships on phase equilibria in iron-magnesium             
              amphiboles using single-crystal and Mossbauer techniques. The                  
              ultimate aim of the work is to make amphiboles, and the reactions              
              in which they take part, valuable geothermometers and                          
              geobarometers.
