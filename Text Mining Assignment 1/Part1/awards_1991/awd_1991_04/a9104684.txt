Abstract    :
              The molecular mechanism of bioluminescence in a diverse group                  
              of marine organisms is studied by a variety of techniques.                     
              The organisms emit light by an enzyme-substrate reaction in                    
              which luciferin (substrate) is oxidized by molecular oxygen,                   
              catalyzed by luciferase.  In Aequorea (jellyfish), where the                   
              light emitted is due to a Ca2+ - binding protein, aequorin,                    
              structural studies are carried out by site-directed                            
              mutagenesis, 19F and 113CD NMR, and x-ray crystallography. In                  
              Vargula (crustacean), recombinant DNA techniques are employed                  
              to produce large amounts of luciferase or comparative and                      
              structural work.  With Porichthys (fish), close structural                     
              analogues of Vargula luciferin, which induces bioluminescence                  
              capability in a non-luminous form of Porichthys, are                           
              synthesized to study the mechanism of the induction.  In                       
              Apogon (fish), whose luciferin and luciferase are similar, if                  
              not identical, to those of Vargula, the luciferase is                          
              purified, the N-terminal amino acid sequence determined, and                   
              compared with that of Vargula for sequence homology.  In                       
              Watasenia (squid) and Stenoteuthis (squid), still                              
              unidentified components of the bioluminescence reactions are                   
              isolated, purified, and characterized.
