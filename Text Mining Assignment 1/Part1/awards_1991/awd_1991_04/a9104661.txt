Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with three projects in                         
              algebraic K-theory.  The first is a continuation of previous                   
              work on the K-theory of twisted forms of reductive group                       
              schemes, with the goal of computing a part of the K-cohomology                 
              of such schemes.  The second project is to use this                            
              computation of the K-theory of group schemes to get a good                     
              description of the K-theory of homogeneous spaces for                          
              reductive groups, and their twisted forms.  The third project                  
              is an investigation of some constructions in motivic                           
              cohomology.                                                                    
                   This research is concerned with algebraic K-theory.  In                   
              a broad sense algebraic K-theory concerns the evolution of                     
              concepts from linear algebra such as basis and vector space.                   
              This work has significant implications for number theory and                   
              algebraic geometry, and promises to make exciting connections                  
              between a number of different areas in mathematics.
