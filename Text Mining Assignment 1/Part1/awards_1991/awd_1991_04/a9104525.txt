Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This RUI project is focused on the characterization of a newly                 
              described lectin from soybean plants that may be related to                    
              assimilate partitioning in these plants.  Among the research                   
              objectives is assessment of how plant treatments affect source vs.             
              sink tissues and concentrations of this lectin, to examine the                 
              physiological significance of this lectin's interactions with a                
              particular leaf storage protein, and to examine the carbohydrate-              
              binding properties of this lectin.  The distribution of the lectin             
              and the leaf storage protein in plants will be assessed using                  
              Western blot hybridization and immunohistochemical localization. //
