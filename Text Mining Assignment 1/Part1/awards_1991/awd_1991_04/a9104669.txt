Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Proteins with active sites consisting of di-iron centers bridged               
              by oxo or hydroxo groups comprise a new subclass of                            
              metalloproteins.  This class includes proteins that perform a                  
              variety of functions in biology -- dioxygen transport                          
              (hemerythrin), oxygen activation (methane monooxygenase), the                  
              conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotide                           
              (ribonucleotide reductase), and phosphate ester hydrolysis                     
              (purple acid phosphatases).  This project will focus on the                    
              latter two enzymes.  Ribonucleotide reductase is the key enzyme                
              in the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotide, while purple acid                  
              phosphatase may be involved in the regulatory mechanisms of                    
              important biological processes.                                                
                                                                                             
              For ribonucleotide reductase, Dr. Que will investigate three                   
              aspects: a) the spectroscopic properties of the diferrous form                 
              and how it interacts with dioxygen, b) the stoichiometry of                    
              tyrosyl radical formation and its implications of cluster-                     
              cluster communication via long range electron transfer, and                    
              c) the use of cryoenzymological techniques to trap                             
              intermediates in the reaction of the di-ferrous form with O2                   
              and spectroscopic characterization of these intermediates.  For                
              purple acid phosphatase, experiments will be carried out to                    
              test a proposed active site model and a proposed mechanism                     
              of enzyme action.  Physical techniques to be used include ultra-               
              violet, visible and infra-red spectroscopy, resonance Raman                    
              spectroscopy, NMR, EPR, Mossbauer spectroscopy, magnetic circular              
              dichroism and EXAFS.
