Abstract    :
                   Theoretical treatments of the deformation of fold and thrust              
              belts and accretionary wedges are based on a number of simplifying             
              assumptions.  This project will refine and utilize a coupled                   
              mechanical-hydrologic finite-element model that will incorporate               
              complications such as irregular geometry, various fluid parameters             
              and variable mechanical properties.  Results should help develop               
              and test hypotheses concerning wedge mechanics.
