Abstract    :
                   This is a collaborative structural, geochronologic and                    
              paleomagnetic study of late Cenozoic tectonics in the NE Mojave                
              desert.  The major faults in this region are sinistral and east-               
              trending, unlike in the rest of the Mojave where NW-trending,                  
              dextral, strike-slip faulting prevails.  This study will determine             
              the relative importance and timing of the two fault systems.  The              
              results will provide information on the interaction between                    
              deformation in the Mojave block and that in the Basin and Range                
              province, and will provide important constraints on the mechanical             
              processes that occur along plate boundary zones.
