Abstract    :
              This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant                   
              biology for two years.  The project entitled "Mechanism of B                   
              locus paramutation in Maize" is to be carried out in the                       
              laboratory of Dr. Vickie Chandler, University of Oregon.  The                  
              applicant received his Ph.D. training in the molecular biology of              
              the bacterial transposon, Tn7.  In his postdoctoral training, Dr.              
              Kubo will focus on mutational events that occur in maize when a                
              specific pair of B chromosomes are present.                                    
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Plant Biology are designed to                  
              increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant                
              biology.
