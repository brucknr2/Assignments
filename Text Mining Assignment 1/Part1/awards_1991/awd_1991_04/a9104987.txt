Abstract    :
              Haskell is a general purpose, purely functional programming language,          
              designed by a 15-member international committee, and named after the           
              logician Haskell B. Curry.  The committee was formed because it was            
              felt that research and application of modern functional languages were         
              being hampered by the lack of a common language.  The design was               
              completed in April 1990, and has been very well received both inside           
              and outside the functional programming community.                              
                   Naturally, there is a great need for a good, robust, and freely           
              available implementation of Haskell.  The Yale Haskell implementation          
              has the potential to serve this role, it being based on years of               
              functional language implementation experience at Yale, and being the           
              most comprehensive implementation of Haskell currently available               
              supporting both compiled and interpreted code, separate compilation,           
              and program development tools.                                                 
                   However, Yale Haskell needs further support to be truly effective         
              and this award provides that support.  Maintaining such a system is            
              not an easy task, and falls more in the category of software                   
              maintenance than research.  Because of the rapid growth of functional          
              programming, the demand for an effective and reliable implementation           
              of Haskell, and the lack of other implementations as comprehensive,            
              necessitates support for Yale Haskell.  The goals are to stabilize,            
              maintain, distribute, and improve the implementation.
