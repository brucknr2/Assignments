Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Within the scope of the proposed research, a complete                          
              range of multinuclear magnetic resonance experiments will be                   
              conducted.  The three research foci are:  Multinuclear                         
              Magnetic Resonance Study of Lanthanide Ion Solvation and                       
              Complex Formation, NMR Study of Chlorophyll A in Galactolipid                  
              Membranes, and Polyborane/Carbon Cluster Chemistry.  The main                  
              objective of the proposed research is the evaluation of the                    
              coordinating properties of the lanthanides in the presence of                  
              a variety of ligands and in different solvent media, with an                   
              eventual expansion of the program to ligands of biological                     
              interest.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This research program, which encompasses instrumentation and                   
              application of NMR to inorganic, organic, and biological                       
              molecules, will be conducted by a chemist and six minority                     
              students at California State University at Los Angeles.
