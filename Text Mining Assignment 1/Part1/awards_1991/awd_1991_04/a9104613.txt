Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at The University of Michigan will                
              provide half-time support over a two-year period for a systems                 
              administrator for a network of computer workstations (Decstation               
              3100's and 5000's) and microcomputers (PC'S and Mac'S) used by                 
              faculty members and graduate students in their research.  The                  
              other half-time support will be paid for by the College of                     
              Literature, Science and the Arts at the University of Michigan.                
              The University of Michigan will assume responsibility for the                  
              full salary at the end of the two-year period.                                 
                                                                                             
              The research areas for which this support is recommended will                  
              include:
