Abstract    :
              This is a two-part project to continue investigation of the                    
              sources and petrogenesis of Cretaceous flood basalts in                        
              Madagascar and the Deccan Traps of India.  It is proposed to                   
              complete study of Madagascan lavas and dikes, conducted in                     
              collaboration with A. Saunders and M. Storey (U. Leicester,                    
              U.K.).  Specifically the plan is: (a) to continue Nd, Pb, and Sr               
              isotopic analysis of a subset of 300 well-documented samples; (b)              
              for Mahoney to contribute to a planned 1991 field trip to the                  
              major remaining exposures in northern Madagascar; and (c) to                   
              conduct isotopic work on selected samples therefrom.  The second               
              focus of the proposed work is an isotopic (Pb, Nd, Sr) study of a              
              unique collection of near-primary picritic lavas and associated                
              basalts in the northern Deccan Traps.  These samples are markedly              
              enriched in highly incompatible elements compared to the Western               
              Ghats formations.  However, their incompatible element patterns                
              suggest that some are likely to be affected little by continental              
              material.  Also, because they may represent some of the earliest               
              eruptions in the Deccan, the plan is to obtain high-quality                    
              40Ar-39Ar dates (from R. Duncan, OSU).
