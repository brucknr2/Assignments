Abstract    :
                This research follows previous successful NSF-supported work that            
              investigated the nature of thrust-type plate boundary tectonics.               
              In the present research, the roughness of the plate boundary at                
              subduction zones and its control of the maximum size of thrust                 
              earthquakes is to be studied.  This may be more important than                 
              subduction rate and plate age as controlling factors proposed                  
              previously.  Also, based on evidence that seismic moment release               
              increased in the few decades before four large California                      
              earthquakes, seismic moment will be investigated prior to large                
              subduction zone events.  Both subjects bear on the estimate of                 
              earthquake risk and hazard.  This research is a component of the               
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
