Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Testicular growth in American tree sparrows occurs in spring in                
              response to increasing daylength.  By early summer, male tree                  
              sparrows become unresponsive to long days (i.e., they become                   
              photorefractory), and their testes regress.  This project explores             
              the physiological mechanisms that turn seasonal breeding on and                
              off.  The first phase tests the hypotheses that (1) a thyroid                  
              hormone (T4) simulates longs days (and thyroidectomy, short days),             
              and (2) for photorefractoriness to be induced, T4 must be available            
              when male tree sparrows experience long days.  The second phase                
              examines the hypothesis that brain receptors for excitatory amino              
              acids (e.g., L-glutamate) transmit processes photic information                
              (from brain photoreceptors, the biological clock, and/or elsewhere)            
              to neurons that control the secretion of reproductive hormones from            
              the pituitary gland.  The ultimate goal of the project is to                   
              strengthen and extend understanding of the physiological basis of              
              seasonal reproduction.//
