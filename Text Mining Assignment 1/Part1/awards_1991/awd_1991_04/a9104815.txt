Abstract    :
              The project investigates a new                                                 
              method for estimating the

              floods.  The method is based on                                                
              separately estimating the

              volumes and the distribution of                                                
              flood peaks conditioned on volume.                                             
              Preliminary results from the upper

              suggests that regionalized                                                     
              estimates of their probability can                                             
              be extrapolated more credibly than

              tested using flood data from other
