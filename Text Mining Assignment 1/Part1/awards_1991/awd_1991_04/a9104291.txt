Abstract    :
                   One of the significant recent developments in continental                 
              tectonics is the appreciation of the widespread role of extensional            
              structures is the evolution of convergent plate margins.  It is                
              becoming increasingly clear that extensional faults with large                 
              displacements can form during compression in convergent settings.              
              This project will utilize the south Tibetan detachment system of               
              the central Himalaya to study an active sample.  The system                    
              contains a north-dipping group of normal-sense shear zones that                
              are thought to have accommodated gravitational collapse of the                 
              Himalayan topographic front in Miocene time.  The work will focus              
              on determining the possible multiple generations of extensional                
              activity during continent-continent collision by mapping,                      
              structural and geochronological techniques.  Results are expected              
              to help define the causes and mechanisms of large-scale extension              
              within active convergence zones.
