Abstract    :
                The investigator proposes to compare two fields of "table-                   
              top" science separated by 25 years: lasers in the early 1960s                  
              and high-temperature superconductors in the mid-1980s.  Focus                  
              will be upon continuities and changes in two kinds of behavior:                
              the international relations of the scientific teams, and the                   
              changing connections of university teams with industry and                     
              government, and the impact of these linkages on the contents                   
              of the research.                                                               
                The project should afford significant insights into the                      
              nature of modern science, particularly the dichotomization                     
              between "big" and "little" science, as well as to the                          
              significance of the relations between university teams and                     
              other sectors of the research community.  It furthers VPW                      
              program objectives to provide opportunities for women to                       
              advance their careers in science or engineering through                        
              research, and to encourage other women to pursue careers in                    
              these areas through the investigators' enhanced visibility as                  
              role models on the host campuses.  In this project, the                        
              proposed activities which contribute to the second objective                   
              include:  teaching three courses over five academic quarters                   
              in the history and philosophy of science--two in the history                   
              of 19th and 20th century physics and one in U.S. science                       
              policy, leading a seminar series in the history of U.S. science                
              policy designed for faculty and graduate students,                             
              participating in the physics colloquium, advising students and                 
              recruiting some to work on special problems, giving public                     
              lectures to make visible female participation in the history                   
              of the "hard sciences," an area of scholarship in which women                  
              are at present underrepresented, and organizing a symposium on                 
              the effect of intersectorial linkages on university research                   
              for one of the major societies.
