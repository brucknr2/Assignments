Abstract    :
              The anticipated results of this research are:                                   
                                                                                             
               o  a methodology for designing concurrent objects that exploits               
                  inheritance.  The methodology has related components for                   
                  reasoning about the observable behavior of an object using a               
                  formalism based on CCS, expressing that behavior using a new               
                  mechanism named behavior sets, and guaranteeing that behavior              
                  during execution using the ACT++ prototype based on MCC's ESP              
                  distributed object-oriented kernel.                                        
                                                                                             
               o  a more mature technology for the garbage collection of active              
                  objects.  This technology serves not only the specific needs of            
                  ACT++ but also contributes to other systems and languages based            
                  on concurrent objects or fine-grain processes.                             
                                                                                             
               o  the first realistic comparative study of concurrent object-based           
                  languages.  This study will employ a common set of medium-scale            
                  problems and involve in the evaluation process leading members of          
                  the international research community.                                      
                                                                                            
              The enhanced ACT++ prototype system will be made available to other            
              researchers.
