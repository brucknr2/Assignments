Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will derive                    
              uniform asymptotic approximations for the solutions of second-                 
              order linear ordinary differential equations that contain a large              
              parameter.  The approximations would be uniformly valid in a                   
              domain of the complex plane that contains a coalescing turning                 
              point and a simple pole.  In the beginning of the project the                  
              principal investigator will concentrate his efforts on                         
              approximating solutions of Mathieu's equation, including                       
              constructing realistic and explicit error bounds.  He then hopes               
              to extend his techniques and results to more general equations                 
              with turning points.                                                           
                   Linear, second-order ordinary differential equations are in               
              a real sense the building blocks for many complex theories in                  
              mathematical physics and asymptotic analysis.  The solutions of                
              such equations are useful in their own right as the solutions of               
              interesting and important physical problems and equally as                     
              paradigms for more complicated phenomena.  In this project the                 
              principal investigator will seek to find accurate approximate                  
              solutions of such an equation, known as Mathieu's equation, that               
              arises in a number of applied contexts.  Its solutions are known               
              eponymously as Mathieu functions, and their properties are                     
              representative of asymptotic properties of solutions of more                   
              general equations involving turning-points.
