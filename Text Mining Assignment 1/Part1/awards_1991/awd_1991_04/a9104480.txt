Abstract    :
              In a cooperative study with Colorado School of Mines the effects               
              of implantation of very large concentrations of ions on friction               
              and wear propertied will be evaluated.  The microstructure,                    
              microhardness, residual surface stresses and tribological behavior             
              of ferrus surfaces, which have been implanted with up to 20 atomic             
              percent of nitrogen, oxygen, boron, and/or carbon, will be                     
              determined and correlated with processing variables.
