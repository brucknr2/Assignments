Abstract    :
              Three principle direction of research will be followed:  1)                    
              Reaction mechanisms and diffusional processes at high pressures,               
              and the role of protons will be examined for the most part by                  
              measuring rate of oxygen isotope exchange under different                      
              conditions; 2) Determination of oxygen isotope fractionation                   
              factors in minerals of interest, in part in conjunction with the               
              above; 3) Order-disorder phenomena in silicates, and synthesis of              
              intermediate states of Al/Si order in albite followed by solution              
              calorimetry at high temperatures for information on the                        
              energetics of the order-disorder process.  This will involve the               
              effect of Al-concentration on diffusion and reaction rates, the                
              varying availability of hydrogen (protons), and examination of                 
              rates of exchange in minerals with variation of 4 and 6 Al                     
              coordinations, all to be oxygen exchanged with CO2 or CaCO3.                   
              Specifically studied will be andalusite, sillimanite and kyanite,              
              the plagioclase series, the melilite series, and the pair beryl-               
              cordierite.  Fractionation factors will also be determined.                    
              Calorimetric work will be carried out on albites (NaAlSi3O8)                   
              synthesized at high pressures with controlled and variable                     
              degrees of Al/Si order to obtain data on the energetics of the                 
              order-disorder process.
