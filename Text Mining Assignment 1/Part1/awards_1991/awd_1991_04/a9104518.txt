Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator and his                        
              colleagues will continue their research on various aspects of                  
              applied mathematics, numerical analysis and fluid dynamics.  In                
              particular, they will conduct analytical, numerical and                        
              experimental studies of viscous flows with free boundaries and                 
              viscous flows inside pipes and channels, a variety of water wave               
              problems and the behavior of waves on sloping beaches.  And they               
              will perform theoretical analyses of numerical techniques like                 
              multi-grid methods that are so essential in resolving fluid                    
              phenomena that are beyond the present capabilities of analysis                 
              and experimentation.                                                           
                   The study of fluid dynamical phenomena provides a challenge               
              to applied mathematicians because so much of the work involves an              
              interplay among the three basic techniques of mathematical                     
              analysis, numerical computation and laboratory experimentation.                
              Given the interdisciplinary nature of the subject it is essential              
              for applied mathematicians to collaborate with experimentalists                
              and computational scientists, in order to tackle successfully                  
              difficult and important problems involving fluid flow.  In this                
              project the principal investigator has assembled the perfect team              
              consisting of fluid dynamicists. numerical analysts and                        
              experimentalists.  Their goal is to continue their important work              
              on understanding and quantifying the fluid dynamics of viscous                 
              flows and water waves.
