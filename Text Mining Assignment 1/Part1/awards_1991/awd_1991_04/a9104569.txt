Abstract    :
                   This project will develop microlocal methods in partial                   
              differential equations and several complex variables.  The main                
              problems to be undertaken are the regularity of solutions to                   
              first order PDEs, the analytic regularity for operators with                   
              double characteristics, and the Szego kernel.  The questions to                
              be analyzed build on recent results by the PI and his                          
              collaborators.                                                                 
                   The project considers state of the art mathematical                       
              questions.  Ample areas of applied mathematics will benefit from               
              the results of this research.
