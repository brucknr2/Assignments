Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study fluid flow in a giant                    
              regional metamorphic hydrothermal system of northern New England,              
              integrating field, mineralogic, petrologic, geochemical, and                   
              isotopic techniques. Data will be interpreted with a model for                 
              fluid-rock interaction that rigorously couples fluid flow with                 
              chemical reaction in porous media. Overall the study will help                 
              geologists understand the role of fluids during the metamorphism               
              of rocks in the Earth's crust.
