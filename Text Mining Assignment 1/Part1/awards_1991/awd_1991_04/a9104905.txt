Abstract    :
                 Internetworking software allows computers attached to physically            
              distinct data networks to communicate with one another.  The recent            
              advent of portable computers suggest that soon a substantial                   
              fraction of all computers can and will move.  Because present                  
              computers rarely move, new approaches to internetworking are                   
              required.  This research investigates how to extend present                    
              internetworking protocols to support mobile computers.  The                    
              approach is a combination of forwarding, multicasting, address                 
              reassignment, and link-level techniques.  The results will be a                
              suite of protocols for locale discovery, dynamic address                       
              assignment, establishment and destruction of forwarding chains, and            
              notification to higher-level protocols of a change of locale.  The             
              work will be evaluated via simulation and demonstration                        
              implementation of their ideas within IP internetworking software.
