Abstract    :
              The objective of this symposium is to exchange knowledge gained                
              from recent Geotechnical Engineering research around the world                 
              involving the use of Calibration Chambers.  There have been four               
              symposia held in europe since 1984, but only few researchers from              
              the U.S. has access to these symposia although significant progress            
              has been made in the U.S. since the first chamber was built in                 
              University of Florida in 1970.  The proposed symposium will provide            
              an international forum for summarizing the state-of-the-art,                   
              exchanging recent knowledge and identifying future directions in               
              research involving the versatile use of calibration chambers.
