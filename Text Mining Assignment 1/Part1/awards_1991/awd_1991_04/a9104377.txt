Abstract    :
              This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant                   
              biology for two years.  The project entitled "Identification of                
              transcription factors involved in regulation of gene expression                
              by light" is to be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Gloria                 
              Coruzzi at Rockefeller University.  The applicant, who has                     
              received a strong training in plant biology, will focus on                     
              studies on the regulation of gene expression in tobacco during                 
              her fellowship tenure.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Plant Biology are designed to                  
              increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant                
              biology.
