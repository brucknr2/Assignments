Abstract    :
                   The investigator and his colleagues in the Program in                     
              Computational and Applied Mathematics in the Mathematics                       
              Department at UCLA undertake expanded educational and research                 
              programs for graduate students.  Fellowships and an outreach                   
              program will be created to recruit and support graduate students.              
              A particular effort to attract and support female graduate                     
              students is a central point of the project.  The training of the               
              graduate students will be enhanced through a program of                        
              scientific visitors, in which established faculty from outside                 
              the university will be invited to give introductory seminars and               
              short courses on topics of current research interest.  To foster               
              interactions of the students with each other, as well as with                  
              faculty, visiting scientists, and postdoctoral scholars, they                  
              will hold a scientific retreat and workshop once a year.                       
                   Current U.S. scientific and technological efforts have                    
              created a national need for teachers and researchers in                        
              scientific computing and applied mathematics.  This project                    
              attempts to address that need in a systematic way, building on                 
              particular local advantages but exploring methods that could be                
              successful elsewhere.
