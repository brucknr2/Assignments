Abstract    :
                   This award provides half of the funding necessary to acquire              
              equipment that will be part of a laser-assisted extraction system              
              to be constructed by the PI at the University of Chicago. The                  
              university is committed to provide the additional funds required               
              to make this acquisition possible. A total of one-month's summer               
              salary for the PI is also provided for in this award.                          
                   The system that will be constructed will be used to analyze               
              oxygen isotopes in silicate and oxide minerals. Oxygen isotope data            
              are important in reconstructing the thermal history of rocks formed            
              in diverse geologic environments. After the equipment is on line               
              the PI will evaluate systematically the reactivity of selected                 
              terrestrial and meteoritic minerals, compare the results of                    
              conventional and laser heating methods, compare the results of in              
              situ laser ablation and micro-drilling, and study fluorination                 
              reaction mechanisms. After the systematic evaluation described                 
              above, this system will be applied in oxygen isotope studies of                
              minerals where it is especially critical to determine chemical                 
              changes over very small distances.
