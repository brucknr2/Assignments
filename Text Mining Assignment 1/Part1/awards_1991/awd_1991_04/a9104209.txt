Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Maryland will               
              purchase high-end workstations and equipment which will be                     
              dedicated to support research in the mathematical sciences.  The               
              equipment will be used for several research projects, including                
              in particular:                                                                 
                                                                                             
              1. Adaptive Finite Element Methods for Adaptive PDEs                           
                                                                                             
              2. High order upwind schemes for systems of conservation laws and              
              computational fluid dynamics                                                   
                                                                                             
              3. Deformation theory of discrete groups and geometric structures              
                                                                                             
              4. Theories of bifurcation and continuation in variational
