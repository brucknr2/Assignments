Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will study the                 
              equations of motion for viscoelastic materials, thermoelastic                  
              materials and thermo-viscoelastic materials.  In particular, he                
              will use the techniques of mathematical analysis to investigate                
              the existence of smooth solutions for all time and their                       
              asymptotic behavior for large times, the formation of                          
              singularities such as shock and rarefaction waves from initially               
              smooth data, and the existence of weak (i.e., nondifferentiable)               
              solutions.  The goal of the work is to understand rigorously the               
              nature of nonlinear elastic responses of materials that are                    
              subjected to dissipative forces such as viscosity and heat.                    
                   Many materials of importance in science and technology                    
              exhibit an elastic response that is modulated by the presence of               
              dissipative forces like viscosity and heat.  The most striking                 
              manifestation of this modulation is the actual breakdown of the                
              material in a finite time due to the formation of shock waves.                 
              Thus it is very important to understand the interplay between                  
              dissipation and the formation of shocks.  In this project the                  
              principal investigator will prove rigorous results concerning the              
              formation and propagation of shock waves in systems of equations               
              that model the behavior of nonlinear elastic bodies in the                     
              presence of viscosity and heat.
