Abstract    :
              Feng         Hypercube and multistage interconnection network (MIN)-based 
              architectures are two promising classes of parallel computers  that have
              received considerable attention in recent years.  The  objective of this
              research is to develop analytical evaluation  techniques for predicting
              performance, dependability, and  performance-related dependability behavior of
              these two classes  of multiprocessors.  The performance model is based on a
              three-level approach -  network level, task (job) level, and system level.  The
              network  level analysis gives the average communication delay which can be 
              used in finding job completion time at the task level.  Using the  job
              completion time, system level parameters such as throughput  and response time
              could be computed from an appropriate queing  model.  Dependability analysis 
              would consider the degradation of  the computing elements and communication
              network for finding  task-based reliability or availability.  The dependability
              model  is aimed at finding a proper subcube for the execution of a task.   The
              analysis covers both unique-path and multi-path MINs.   Performance-related
              dependability models are being developed by  associating suitable performance
              measures with the structure  states of a multiprocessor.  This project will
              make available a  complete set of tools for analyzing these two classes of 
              multiprocessors that have a great promise for different  applications.
