Abstract    :
                   This grant supports operation of the Princeton cyclotron                  
              laboratory and the nuclear physics research of the faculty and                 
              staff.  The group will carry out measurements at the frontiers                 
              of nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics, and will study                       
              fundamental symmetries and interactions.  Some of the research                 
              will be carried out in collaboration with scientists at other                  
              facilities - ATLAS at Argonne National Laboratory, the Indiana                 
              University Cyclotron Facility, the Sudbury Neutrino                            
              Observatory, and the Soviet-American Gallium Experiment.  An                   
              experiment at Princeton will study the breakdown of time                       
              reversal invariance in the B decay of polarized 19Ne.  A 3He-                  
              4He dilution refrigerator, operating at temperatures below                     
              0.01 K, will cool bolometric detectors to investigate the                      
              possibility of a 17 keV neutrino mass state in the B decay of                  
              63Ni.  Research at the Princeton facility by numerous outside                  
              users will be carried out using the unique features of the                     
              cyclotron laboratory.
