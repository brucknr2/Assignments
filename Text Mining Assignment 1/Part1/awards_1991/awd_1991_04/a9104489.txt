Abstract    :
                   The monsoon forms one of the most important features of the               
              planetary atmospheric circulation, and the wet/dry seasonal pattern            
              dominates the climate over large portions of tropical and                      
              subtropical Asia, Australia and Africa (Webster, 1987a).  India                
              lies at the heart of the classic monsoon region, and is the area               
              most sensitive to monsoon fluctuations.  It is ideally suited for              
              a hydroclimatic application of paleofloods, as monsoon-related                 
              storms cause the largest floods.  Slackwater deposits from floods              
              in bedrock canyons are direct evidence of discrete extreme                     
              hydrologic events rather than proxy indicators of average climatic             
              conditions.  We will develop paleoflood records on several rivers              
              in India to chronicle fluctuations in the monsoon intensity over               
              centuries to millennia.  The climatic implications of variations               
              in the monsoon extend far beyond the Indian subcontinent through               
              broad global teleconnections between the monsoon and other climatic            
              phenomena such as the El Nino/Southern Oscillation.  Our research              
              will address regional hydrologic effects of global change that                 
              directly impact the inhabitants of the most populous portions of               
              the Earth.
