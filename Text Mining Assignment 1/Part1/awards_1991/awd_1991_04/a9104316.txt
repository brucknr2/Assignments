Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor J. Pila to work             
              in number theory.  In particular, he wishes to work on algorithms              
              for counting points on the reductions of Jacobians of hyperelliptic            
              curves of genus 2.  He also intends to work on obtaining improved              
              bounds for the number of integral lattice points on curves lying               
              inside squares.                                                                
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in areas such as developing new                
              algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes for             
              electronics.
