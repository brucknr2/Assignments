Abstract    :
                This research will use a combination of coincident vertical-                 
              incidence and wide-angle reflection profiling to study the                     
              controversial Boulder batholith, a late-Cretaceous epizonal granite            
              in Montana.  While much progress has been made on granite                      
              petrogenesis through studies of melting relations, isotopes and                
              trace elements, little use has been made of modern seismic                     
              techniques that can image the subsurface with much higher                      
              resolution than has previously been possible.  The nature of the               
              seismic boundaries, including the Moho, which may be reconstituted             
              during batholith emplacement, will be determined through forward               
              modeling by illuminating them with P-, S- and converted waves at               
              different angles of incidence.
