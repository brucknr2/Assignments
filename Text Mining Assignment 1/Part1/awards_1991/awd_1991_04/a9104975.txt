Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out in pion                  
              physics at LAMPF and PSI.  Experiments will focus on new                       
              absorption mechanisms involved in pion absorption, and on                      
              fundamental pion nucleon scattering, including spin degrees of                 
              freedom.  The latter work will shed light on the strange quark                 
              content in the nucleon and also improve our understanding of                   
              the fundamental pion-nucleon interaction.  In addition,                        
              experiments will be designed for the CEBAF facility relating                   
              to electro pion production and nuclear systems.  A strong                      
              instrumentation effort is involved in these latter activities.
