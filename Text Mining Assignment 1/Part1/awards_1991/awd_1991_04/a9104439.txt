Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is founded upon the Phase I work which proved                    
              that small quantities of low cost proprietary catalysts were                   
              effective in achieving large NOx reduction.  The major                         
              objectives of the Phase I research plan were met or exceeded,                  
              including proof of the catalytic activity of the materials to                  
              achieve 40% reductions of NOx in a laboratory reactor.  A                      
              statistical experimental design was used to develop empirical                  
              rate coefficients.  This proposal extends the Phase I work,                    
              proposing larger scale testing under commercially relevant                     
              catalyst loadings and operating conditions.  Particle size,                    
              catalyst aging, and the effects of H2O, hydrocarbons, SOx, and                 
              other potential poisons will be investigated.  Phase II                        
              extends the operating scope to low temperatures (320 F to 550                  
              F), as the Phase I work implied that the catalysts are active                  
              at temperatures below 550 F (560 K).                                           
                                                                                             
              The catalysts are low cost, using materials endemic to the                     
              U.S., and represent U.S. technology.  The successful concept                   
              has the potential to reduce NOx compliance and energy costs,                   
              resulting in economic benefits to the U.S. power industry.
