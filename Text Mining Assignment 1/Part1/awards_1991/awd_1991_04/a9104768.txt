Abstract    :
                   Arc-continent collisions are a relatively common phenomena in             
              earth history, but the style and especially rates of deformation               
              associated with such collisions are poorly known.  This project                
              will utilize the active oblique arc-continent collision of the                 
              Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates to attempt to quantify these                
              parameters.  Uplift rates will be determined by tectonic                       
              geomorphologic methods applied to uplifted marine strand lines and             
              river terraces and, combined with existing structural information,             
              will be used to resolve how and at what rate oblique convergence               
              is translated into reverse and strike-slip deformation.
