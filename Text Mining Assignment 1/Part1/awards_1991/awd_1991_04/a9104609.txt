Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study fine-grained magmatic                    
              inclusions in the plutonic rocks of Cadillac Mountain (Mount                   
              Desert Island, Maine) and the Tumacacori Mountains (southern                   
              Arizona). She will attempt to document the variety of                          
              contamination mechanisms and the effects of contamination of the               
              host materials by these inclusions, and also to evaluate the                   
              magmatic processes which generated the original liquids. The                   
              results will help geologists better understand processes that                  
              affect the evolution of magmas in the Earth's lithosphere.
