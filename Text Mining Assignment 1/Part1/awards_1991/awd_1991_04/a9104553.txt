Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study the isotopic systematics of             
              synmetamorphic Acadian granitoids and potential metamorphic source             
              rocks of New England. In doing so they will attempt to evaluate the            
              relative importance of mantle magmatism versus crustal anatexis in             
              the genesis of these plutonic rocks.
