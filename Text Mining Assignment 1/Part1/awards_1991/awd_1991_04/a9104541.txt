Abstract    :
                   This award will continue research in experimental                         
              gravitation and low-energy elementary particle physics by                      
              Professor Adelberger's group.  Sensitive searches for new                      
              macroscopic interactions will be carried out.  The University                  
              of Washington team will probe interactions with ranges greater                 
              than 3 cm by looking for apparent violations of the weak                       
              equivalence principle.  They will develop two torsion balance                  
              instruments for this purpose:                                                  
                   --   a continuously rotating balance used in                              
                   conjunction with a fixed topographic source.  This                        
                   device will be optimized for interactions with                            
                   ranges from infinity down to 1m.                                          
                   --   a stationary balance used in conjunction with a                      
                   continuously rotating 3 ton uranium source optimized                      
                   for interactions with ranges between 0.03m and 10m.                       
              By placing unpolarized test bodies in these instruments they                   
              plan a 10-fold improvement in constraints on macroscopic                       
              scalar or vector interactions.  They will also develop a novel                 
              spin-polarized pendulum to search for parity and time-reversal                 
              violating monopole-dipole interactions.
