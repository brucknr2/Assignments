Abstract    :
              The rapid progress of advancements in the discipline of heat                   
              transfer and the importance of past accomplishments have                       
              heightened expectations from this discipline.  Yet many of the                 
              most important areas for thermal science research still lie                    
              ahead.  With expectations high and the potential for impact                    
              significant, it is imperative that thermal science                             
              practitioners and researchers plan the future path and needed                  
              milestones for this discipline.  The impact on future                          
              technology and understanding of important phenomena need to be                 
              critically evaluated and the significant issues delineated.                    
              Basic understanding and technological impact are key.                          
                                                                                             
              This project is a combined program/workshop to assess the role                 
              of the thermal sciences related to emerging technologies and                   
              to identify critical phenomena which need further research.                    
              The Program is directed at the development of a strategic plan                 
              aimed at enhancing the economic competitiveness of the United                  
              States in the world marketplace and at ensuring that                           
              appropriate fundamental research is carried out in the thermal                 
              sciences.
