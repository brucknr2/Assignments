Abstract    :
                   This award will provide 50% of the funds required to acquire              
              an electron microprobe to be installed and operated in the                     
              Department of Geological and Geophysical Sciences at Princeton                 
              University. Princeton is committed to providing the remaining funds            
              required.                                                                      
                   The electron microprobe will be used to provide quantitative              
              chemical analyses with spatial resolution on the order of a                    
              micrometer for research projects in petrology, mineralogy, and                 
              geochemistry for which small-scale materials characterization is               
              critical. The instrument will be part of the Princeton campus-wide             
              materials science facility and will be widely available for use.
