Abstract    :
                   The role of margin-parallel translations of accreted oceanic              
              terranes is of current interest in transpressional orogens.  This              
              is an interdisciplinary investigation of deformed and metamorphosed            
              oceanic rocks on islands off Baja California Sur, Mexico.  The                 
              islands contain island arc assemblages, ophiolitic rocks,                      
              blueschist-facies subduction-related rocks and sparse cover, the               
              ages of which are unknown but thought to be Mesozoic.  This study              
              will determine the ages of crystallization, coding, and                        
              metamorphism of the igneous rocks and will obtain geochemical,                 
              biostratigraphic, structural and paleomagnetic data.  The results              
              will be used to correlate tectonic terranes in western and southern            
              Mexico and to determine the timing and magnitude of margin-parallel            
              displacements.  These findings will place important constraints on             
              the tectonic evolution of the southern Cordillera of the western               
              North American plate.
