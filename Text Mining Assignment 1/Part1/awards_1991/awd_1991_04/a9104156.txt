Abstract    :
                   Dr. Thomas Duncan, a botanist at the University of                        
              California, Berkeley, has helped to establish an Association of                
              California Herbaria, a network of 145 repositories in which                    
              representatives of California's plants are curated for research.               
              Dr. Duncan now plans to implement a regionally-connected database              
              of the plant specimens contained in these herbaria.  The flora of              
              California includes 25-30% of the plant species in the U.S., and               
              an unusually high percentage of rare and endemic species.                      
              California herbaria currently contain 7 million specimens, half                
              of which were collected in the state.   The University of                      
              California, Berkeley, would serve as the Technical Coordinating                
              Center for the effort, and Dr. Duncan has enlisted the active                  
              involvement of the University's Information Systems and                        
              Technology (IST) Department.  During the next two years, a                     
              prototype database will be established at Berkeley's University                
              and Jepson Herbaria through data entry of approximately 80,000                 
              specimen records.                                                              
                   This pioneering effort will establish the first truly                     
              regional resources for managing biodiversity data.  It will                    
              provide a model for multi-institution collaborations, and will                 
              generate software with wide applicability.  The creation of this               
              shared database will facilitate rational planning for future                   
              collecting, research, and curation, and will support conservation              
              efforts.
