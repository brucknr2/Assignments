Abstract    :
                   Professor Garnett's research project is in function theory.               
              The topics to be investigated include the algebra of bounded                   
              analytic functions on the unit disk, the corona problem in the                 
              plane, analytic capacity, and quasiconformal mappings.                         
                   The main focus of Professor Garnett's research is the theory              
              of functions of one complex variable which are differentiable in               
              the sense of elementary calculus. These functions are defined on a             
              domain in the plane but not necessarily on its boundary.  Some of              
              the most interesting problems in analysis concern the behavior of              
              these functions as the complex variable approaches the boundary.               
              Professor Garnett's research will focus in part on such questions.
