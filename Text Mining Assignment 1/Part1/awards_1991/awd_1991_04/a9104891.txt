Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the subgroup structure of                  
              finite and algebraic groups of Lie type.  The principal                        
              investigator will consider general reductive overgroups and                    
              the minimal connected overgroup of arbitrary unipotent                         
              elements.  She will also examine certain triples of                            
              quasisimple groups of Lie type in an effort to classify the                    
              maximal subgroups of the finite classical groups.  Finally she                 
              will work on extending a homomorphism of finite groups of Lie                  
              type to a morphism of suitable algebraic groups.                               
                   A group is an algebraic object with a single operation                    
              defined on it.  Groups occur naturally in many different areas                 
              of mathematics, as well as, physics and chemistry.  During the                 
              last decade, many researchers have worked on determining the                   
              subgroup structure of finite simple groups of Lie type.  The                   
              approach used in this project is to view the question on                       
              finite groups in the context of algebraic groups.
