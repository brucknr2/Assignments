Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A detailed understanding of the dynamic internal motion of                     
              globular proteins is of fundamental importance to a knowledge                  
              of the structure/function relationships of proteins.  Dr. Schuh                
              has recently discovered that quenching of the phosphorescence                  
              of 6-bromo-2-naphthyl sulfate by the heme of heme proteins can                 
              be used to assess transient openings in cytochrome c and                       
              myoglobin.  The rate constant for quenching, kq, is determined                 
              from lifetime measurements of laser-induced phosphorescence and                
              is used to estimate the extent to which motion of heme proteins                
              makes the prosthetic heme rings accessible.  If 1-bromopyrene,                 
              bromoanthracenes, 9-bromophenanthrenes, and eosin, are found                   
              to be suitable phosphorescent probes, it is proposed that the                  
              correlation of kq with the size of the molecular probe be used                 
              to estimate the size of transient openings in the heme proteins                
              myoglobin, hemoglobin, cytochromes c and cytochrome c                          
              peroxidase.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The ultimate goals are to: 1) estimate the size of transient                   
              fluctuations in proteins, 2) determine whether accessibility                   
              of the heme ring in redox proteins is important for the flow                   
              of electrons in and out of the proteins, and 3) determine the                  
              importance of transient changes in tertiary structure of the                   
              oligomers of hemoglobin during the binding and release of                      
              dioxygen molecules.  The achievement of these goals will                       
              improve our understanding of structure/function relationships                  
              in proteins.
