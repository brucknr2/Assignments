Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with studies of surfaces, particularly              
              their structural, statistical mechanical and kinetic properties by             
              employing Low-Energy Electron Diffraction and Scanning Tunneling               
              Microscopy (STM).  Prior results on strained silicon surfaces have             
              shown dramatic and previously unexpected effects on the arrangement            
              of surface steps as a function of strain for a silicon (100)                   
              surface.  It is proposed to continue studies of the various                    
              consequences of the strain fields, including terrace width                     
              distributions, step-step interactions, step migration kinetics,                
              step fluctuations and the temperature dependence of the step free              
              energies.  Quantitative studies of the double height step                      
              transition on silicon (100) surfaces will also be initiated.                   
              Exploratory studies of the initial stages of oxidation of silicon              
              (100) surfaces will be begun.  An investigation of the fundamentals            
              of the reaction will be begun using both the spatial and                       
              spectroscopic resolution of the STM.  This work may lead to the                
              study of the interaction of vacancies with the various steps, the              
              nucleation and growth of voids on terraces and vacancy diffusion.              
              It is intended to extend the strain studies to isotropic strain                
              rather than the uniaxial strain used to date.  Lastly, recent                  
              studies of the sodium/silicon adsorption system using an atomic                
              beam source will be extended to STM observations of the 3x2 and                
              other incommensutate structures and also to the potassium/silicon              
              system for comparison with the work of others.
