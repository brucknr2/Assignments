Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professors C. Delzell                
              and J. Madden to work in real algebraic geometry.  They will work              
              on a general theory of local real algebraic geometry connecting                
              singularities with intersections using notions from ordered                    
              fields.  They also intend to work on relations between lattice                 
              ordered rings and real algebraic geometry, Lipschitz continuity                
              and differentiability of abstract semialgebraic functions and                  
              smoothly varying solutions to Hilbert's 17'th problem.                         
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                
              to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems               
              that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures                 
              defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                      
              polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from                      
              algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it                
              is extensively used in those fields.  Moreover, it has proved                  
              itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical                     
              computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
