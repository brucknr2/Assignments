Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant                   
              biology for two years.  The project entitled "Analysis of                      
              Arabidopsis circadian clock" is to be carried out in the                       
              laboratory of Dr. Steve Kay, at the NSF Center for Biological                  
              Timing located at University of Virginia.  This fellow has                     
              studied the electron transport system of photosystem I in                      
              cyanobacteria for her Ph.D.  With this fellowship, she will gain               
              research experience in Arabidopsis molecular genetics in general               
              and the molecular basis of biological clock in particular.                     
                                                                                             
              The postdoctoral fellowships in plant biology are designed to                  
              increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant                
              biology.
