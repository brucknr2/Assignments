Abstract    :
                   The subject of the special year funded by this award will be              
              interdisciplinary in nature, emphasizing developing connections                
              between topology and modular representation theory with                        
              applications to algebraic K-theory, algebraic geometry, algebraic              
              number theory, and the cohomology of groups.  Algebraic topology               
              has freely employed numerous techniques from algebra and algebraic             
              geometry.  Analysis of splittings in the stable homotopy category              
              now employs modular representation of finite groups and global                 
              studies of the stable homotopy category have introduced familiar               
              concepts from algebraic number theory.  On the other hand, the                 
              application of topological techniques to study algebraic cycles and            
              the topological analysis of rings of integers in number theory                 
              provide two very recent examples that the interaction goes both                
              ways.  The solutions of the Sullivan and Segal Conjectures have                
              lead to numerous connections with the representation theory of                 
              compact Lie groups and these connections have provided powerful new            
              techniques in homotopy theory.                                                 
                   This grant will fund an Emphasis Year on the above subject at             
              Northwestern University during 1991-92.  An integral part of this              
              special year is an international conference to be held in March,               
              1992.  This special year and conference are timely and will provide            
              a needed forum for new developments and a foundation for further               
              results.
