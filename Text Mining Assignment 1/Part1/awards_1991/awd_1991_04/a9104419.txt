Abstract    :
                   A detailed experimental study of electron collisions with                 
              barium in excited states prepared by laser excitation will be                  
              carried out.  The studies will include:                                        
                   (a) Measurement of differential cross sections for                        
              excitation and deexcitation.                                                   
                   (b) Measurement of cross sections for ionization from                     
              excited states.                                                                
                   (c) Measurements of superelastic cross sections from which                
              impact coherence parameters will be derived.
