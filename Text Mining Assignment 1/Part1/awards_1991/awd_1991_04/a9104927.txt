Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses the detailed examination of cumulate-                  
              textured and layered igneous rocks from a geologic environment                 
              not yet thoroughly evaluated in terms of cumulate processes.                   
              This project plans a comprehensive study of hundreds of Mauna Kea              
              xenoliths from many cinder cones.  The PIs will apply                          
              petrography, electron microprobe, ion microprobe, XRF, INA, and                
              O-isotopes to develop models for crustal/cumulate processes,                   
              compositions of liquids that produced the cumulate rocks,                      
              relationships among the different rock types, and the attending                
              crystal/crystal and crystal/melt fractionations for a closed                   
              igneous environment.  The results should contribute to a better                
              understanding of cumulate processes, and constrain future                      
              crystallization models for Hawaiian basaltic magmas.
