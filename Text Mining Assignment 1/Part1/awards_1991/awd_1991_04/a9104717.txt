Abstract    :
              The primary structure of the rRNA of ribosomes plays a crucial role            
              in protein synthesis.  Genetic and biochemical methods are employed            
              to study the relationship between the primary structure and                    
              function of selected regions of ribosomal rRNA.  Site-specific                 
              mutagenesis in M13 is used to make base changes in rRNA.  In                   
              particular, the focus is on bases in the 530, 790 and 980 loop                 
              regions of 16S rRNA of 30S ribosomes of Escherichia coli, which are            
              involved in elongation and tRNA interactions in protein synthesis.             
              The mutated region of rDNA is cloned into one of a variety of                  
              plasmids containing the rRNA operon behind constitutive or                     
              inducible promoters to permit the study of any type of mutation,               
              including those which are lethal to the cell.                                  
                                                                                             
              To study the properties of a homogeneous population of mutant                  
              ribosomes in vivo and to uncover subtle effects of "recessive"                 
              mutational changes, mutations are cloned into a 16S rRNA gene which            
              carries the spectinomycin resistant marker (U1192).  In the                    
              presence of spectinomycin, the cell must rely entirely on plasmid              
              coded 30S ribosomes containing the mutant rRNA.  Maxicells are to              
              determine if mutant rRNA is incorporated into subunits, 70S                    
              ribosomes and polysomes.  Functional effects of mutants are assayed            
              in vitro using defined reactions of protein synthesis.
