Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award provides 50% of the funds needed for the                       
              acquisition of a directly coupled plasma spectrometer (DCP) and a              
              spectrophotometer (SPM) to analyze natural geologic and synthetic              
              fluids produced in laboratory experiments. The university is                   
              committed to provide the additional funds required to make this                
              acquisition possible. This equipment ,which will be housed in the              
              Department of Geological Sciences at Southern Methodist University,            
              will be used extensively by the PI and his students and by a number            
              of other faculty and graduate students.                                        
                   The DCP and SPM will be used to determine chemical                        
              compositions of bulk rocks and groundwaters, solubilities of                   
              minerals, and mineral fluid reaction rates.Faculty and students                
              using this equipment will be obtaining chemical analyses that will             
              be an important component of a diverse set of research projects.               
              These projects will include studies of : weathering and soil                   
              formation, global cycling of carbon dioxide, paleohydrology in                 
              different terrains, and fluid-rock interaction during metamorphism             
              and mantle metasomatism.
