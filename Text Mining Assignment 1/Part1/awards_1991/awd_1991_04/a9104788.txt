Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Support is requested for a full day symposium (morning and                     
              afternoon sessions on the same day) entitled "Current perspectives             
              on the evolution, ecology, and comparative physiology of bimodal               
              breathing" to be held at the annual meeting of the American Society            
              of Zoologists, December 27-30, 1991, in Atlanta, Georgia.  The                 
              purpose of the symposium is to bring together an international                 
              group of both established and young investigators in order to 1)               
              highlight the advances made in understanding bimodally breathing               
              organisms both as the extant link in the evolutionary process by               
              which animals invaded the terrestrial habitat and as unique model              
              systems for elucidating basic physiological and biochemical                    
              mechanisms of adaptation, 2) define the important areas for future             
              research, and 3) to promote interdisciplinary and international                
              collaboration in future research efforts.  The topics to be covered            
              in the program are interdisciplinary by design:  including                     
              physical, evolutionary, ecological, morphological, developmental,              
              physiological, and biochemical factors that affect bimodally                   
              breathing organisms.  The speakers represent an international                  
              assemblage of both established and emerging investigators within               
              the various fields of study concerning bimodal breathing.  A wide              
              range of taxonomic groups will be featured in the presentations,               
              bringing together an array of different organisms under a single               
              theme and underscoring the prevelance and importance of                        
              biodiversity in this field of study.  Proceedings of the symposium             
              will be published in the American Zoologist, and it will comprise              
              the first and only reference to treat bimodal breathing as a                   
              complex, integrated process.//
