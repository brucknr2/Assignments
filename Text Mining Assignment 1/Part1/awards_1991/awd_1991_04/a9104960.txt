Abstract    :
              The long term goal of this project is to determine the crystal                 
              structures of heme containing enzymes.  New structural                         
              information is expected to broaden our data base on two                        
              fundamental mechanistic questions:  first, the mechanism by which              
              heme enzymes activate molecular oxygen and/or hydroperoxides and;              
              second, the mechanism by which electrons transfer between                      
              proteins in intermolecular complexes.  Structural information                  
              derived by x-ray diffraction techniques is essential to address                
              these questions.  Therefore, the main tools to be employed in                  
              this work are those of protein x-ray crystallography.  The                     
              project focuses on the crystal structure determination of lignin               
              peroxidase (or ligninase) and mutant forms of cytochrome c                     
              peroxidase.
