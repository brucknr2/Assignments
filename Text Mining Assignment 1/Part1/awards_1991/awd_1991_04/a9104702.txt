Abstract    :
              The Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics at              
              Northwestern University will purchase an IBM RISC System/6000                  
              POWERstation 530 which will be dedicated to support research in                
              the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for                     
              several research projects including in particular:                             
                                                                                             
              1. Flame propagation in closed vessels.                                        
              2. Stability of stretched flames.                                              
              3. Flame spread over thin liquid films.                                        
              4. Coating of a liquid film along a plane.                                     
              5. Microscopic free boundary problems in a porous media.                       
                                                                                             
              These five projects involve the numerical computation of free                  
              boundary problems in fluid mechanics and combustion. They are all              
              computationally intensive and are of mathematical as well as of                
              physical interest.
