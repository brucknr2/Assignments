Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent experiments by the applicants have shown that the glycogen-             
              deficient phenotype of the glc7- (ppy1-1) mutant of S. cerevisiae              
              is a result of a mutation in the gene for the catalytic subunit of             
              protein phosphatase 1.  This gene, which has been cloned an named              
              PPY1, shares 81% sequence identity at the amino acid level with                
              phosphatase 1 from rabbit skeletal muscle.  The first major                    
              objective of the proposed studies is to determine the DNA sequence             
              of the mutant PPY1 gene and to compare wild type and mutant protein            
              phosphatase 1 with respect to substrate specificity, turnover                  
              number and association with regulatory proteins.  The association              
              with regulatory proteins is of particular interest since                       
              preliminary experiments indicate that chromatographic properties               
              of the enzyme are affected by the mutation, a finding which is most            
              readily explained by altered association with regulatory subunits.             
              In rabbit skeletal muscle, protein phosphatase 1 exists only in                
              association with one of the three regulatory subunits, which are               
              know as inhibitor 2, G-subunit and M-subunit.  The second major                
              objective of the proposed studies is to characterize regulatory                
              subunits or heat-stable inhibitor proteins that interact with the              
              phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit and to determine if they are                   
              homologous to the regulatory proteins that have been identified in             
              mammals.  Association with regulatory subunits will be evaluated               
              by identification of holoenzyme forms by chromatographic and                   
              immunological methods.  The results of these experiments will help             
              to elucidate the regulation of an important class of enzymes.//
