Abstract    :
              This project is to carry out geochemical, physical, and                        
              experimental analyses of the pumice falls that resulted from                   
              plinian eruptions of Mount St. Helens.  The objectives will be to              
              examine the relationship between changes in eruption dynamics and              
              differences in magmatic composition, rheology, and volatile                    
              content.  Changes in the storage of magma (e.g., pressure,                     
              temperature, degree of volatile saturation) during the last 4,000              
              years at Mount St. Helens will also be investigated and examined               
              for correlations to variations in eruption dynamics.  This                     
              integrated physical-volcanologic, petrologic, and experimental                 
              study of actual eruptions will complement theoretical work to                  
              better understand the factors which control the style of                       
              explosive volcanism and the composition of its products.
