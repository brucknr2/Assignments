Abstract    :
              This renewal proposal is aimed at understanding the behavior of                
              molecular and polymeric solids when photo-chemical or photo-thermal            
              reactions occur, with a focus on changes that occur during the                 
              first few picoseconds.  Three distinct areas to be investigated                
              are:  (1)  ultrafast mechanical energy transfer processes in                   
              solids; (2)  the study of thermal conduction over nanometer length             
              scales, and conformal rearrangements in superheated polymers; (3)              
              solid state chemical reactions in the amorphous solid state                    
              (glasses and polymers), and practical photoresist systems.
