Abstract    :
                   This project will involve nonlinear strictly hyperbolic                   
              differential equations.  We will consider the following problems:              
              estimates for linear equations, decay of solutions, and extension              
              to nonconstant coefficients of results known for the                           
              D'Alambertian operator.  The studies will include the analysis of              
              the interaction of singularities across nonsmooth surfaces.                    
              Further construction of examples exhibiting nonlinear                          
              singularities will be attempted.  Precise regularity                           
              theorems will be developed in order to show that certain explicit              
              approximate solutions differ from the actual ones.                             
                   Technological developments such as better radars, X-ray                   
              devices, and scanners ultimately rely on the understanding of the              
              hyperbolic equations considered in this project.
