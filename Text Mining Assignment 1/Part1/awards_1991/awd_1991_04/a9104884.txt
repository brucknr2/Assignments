Abstract    :
              This study is to determine the nature and causes of                            
              compositional variation in lavas from the continuing eruption of               
              Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii.  Mineral, glass and whole-rock                        
              compositions and Pb, Sr and Nd isotope ratios will be determined               
              and used to evaluate the relative importance of crystal                        
              fractionation, magma mixing and mantle melting processes in                    
              controlling the composition of the lavas erupted.  It is also                  
              proposed to evaluate the temporal and spatial variations in the                
              composition of lavas erupted historically at the summit of                     
              Kilauea Volcano.  This study will evaluate the size and location               
              of the summit reservoir (which are still poorly known), and will               
              be the first to determine modes, mineral and glass major                       
              elements, whole-rock major, and trace elements, and O, Pb, Sr and              
              Nd isotope ratios, all on the same samples.  Petrological and                  
              geochemical results from this study will be integrated with field              
              and geophysical measurements and interpretation made by the staff              
              of the U.S.G.S.
