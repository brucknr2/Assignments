Abstract    :
              The aim of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms whereby               
              histones interact with DNA such that RNA and DNA polymerases as                
              well as sequence-specific proteins can access the DNA to complete              
              their nuclear functions.  The relevance of these analyses is to the            
              need to understand the processes that regulate programmed                      
              differentiation and then subsequently maintain that differentiated             
              state during proliferation of the cells.  These processes are                  
              distorted during carcinogenesis to produce the malignant phenotype.            
              Procedure for purfication of the individual histones have been                 
              developed, including uH2A and uH2B which maintains the structural              
              integrity of the proteins such athat reassembly of heterotypic                 
              interactions is very efficient.  Procedures have also been                     
              developed to measure rapid rates of nculeosome formation and                   
              measure the effects of transcription-induced stresses on nucleosome            
              stability.  These assays involve measuring superhelical densities              
              of the DNA, its protection from nucleases, and accessibility of the            
              histone to conjugation by 125 Iubiquitin.  With combinations of                
              these procedures it will be possible to examine the role of uH2A,              
              uH2B in providing accessibility of nucleosomal DNA sequences to                
              sequence-specific proteins, the role of H2A and H2B exchange in                
              facilitating transcription rates, and the processes involved in the            
              assembly of nucleosomes during replication and transcription.
