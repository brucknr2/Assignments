Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program is to Dr. Sheldon G. Shore of the Department of                        
              Chemistry, Ohio State University, for synthesis of new                         
              transition metal carbonyl cluster compounds.  The number of                    
              metals in the cluster used as the starting material is                         
              typically six, and metals are Ru or Os.  Loss of CO from known                 
              clusters results in new species which can be utilized in the                   
              synthesis of mixed metal clusters containing seven metal atoms.                
              Attempts will be made to encapsulate boron into the mixed-metal                
              clusters thus formed.  Additional target molecules result from                 
              reaction of lanthanide cations with ruthenium, iron, and                       
              iron-ruthenium carbonylates.  In a second part of the project,                 
              the behavior of clusters on magnesia surfaces will be                          
              investigated, especially with respect to proton transfer,                      
              thermal degradation, and reaction with hydrogen.

              This project involves the development of new synthetic methods                 
              for metallic and bimetallic carbonyls.  Some of the species                    
              prepared will be used to produce metal cluster compounds                       
              containing electron-deficient boranes or carboranes.  Others                   
              will be reacted with solid magnesia to model surface reactions.                
              This work has application both to understanding bonding and                    
              reactivity of organometallic compounds and to heterogeneous                    
              catalysis.
