Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant                   
              biology for two years.  The project entitled "Maize meiosis: the               
              role of the centromere" is to be carried out in the laboratory of              
              Dr. Zacheus Cande at University of California, Berkeley.  This                 
              fellow whose background is in the molecular genetics of maize                  
              will study the mytotic cell cycle in maize using cell biology                  
              techniques.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The postdoctoral fellowships in plant biology are designed to                  
              increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant                
              biology.
