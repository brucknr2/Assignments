Abstract    :
                   There is renewed interest in the importance of fluids in a                
              variety of crustal processes such as granite genesis, metamorphism             
              and heat and mass transport.  This project will study relationships            
              between granite magmatism, metamorphism and fluid flow using the               
              very young Nanga Parbat-Haramosh Massif in the Pakistan Himalaya.              
              This area records rapid uplift and denudation that appears near                
              coevil with both granite formation and possible topographically                
              driven fluid flaw.  This hypothesis will be tested by an integrated            
              petrologic, stable-isotopic, geochronologic and structural study               
              of the Nanga Parbat-Haramosh area.  Data obtained using these                  
              techniques are expected to provide constraints on the role of                  
              surface-driven fluids in the petrogenesis of granites and                      
              metamorphic rocks in the NW Himalaya and in compressional mountain             
              belts in general.
