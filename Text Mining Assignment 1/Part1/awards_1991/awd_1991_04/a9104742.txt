Abstract    :
              The structure, mechanism and regulation of the ATP synthases of                
              chloroplast, mitochondrial, and bacterial membranes are major                  
              problems in biochemistry.  This proposal deals with chloroplast                
              purification of the subunits of CFo, the integral membrane portion             
              of the chloroplast ATP synthase, in active form, and the                       
              reconstituted of proton translocation and the binding of CF 1, the             
              extrinsic, catalytic part of the synthase.  Fluorescence resonance             
              energy transfer will be used to extend the extensive structural map            
              obtained for CF1 to CFo.   The binding of nucleotides to CF1 in                
              relation to initial rates of catalysis will be examined.                       
              Calorimetric analyses are proposed that should give information                
              about ATP-induced conformational changes in CF1 as well as about               
              the role of nucleotide binding in stabilizing the enzyme.                      
              Structural mapping of a fourth nucleotide binding site will be                 
              carried out.  The role of the epsilon subunit of CF1 will be                   
              examined.  The binding of epsilon to CF1 deficient in this subunit             
              will be studied by fluorescence and by isothermal titration                    
              calorimetry.
