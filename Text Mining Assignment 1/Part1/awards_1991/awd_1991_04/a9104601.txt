Abstract    :
                                                                                              
              MOLECULAR BASIS OF CYANIDE ASSIMILATION IN PSEUDOMONAS BACTERIA                
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The fundamental goal of the proposed research is to establish the              
              metabolic mechanism of cyanide transformation in two different                 
              Pseudomonas bacteria.  Although it has been recognized for some                
              time that microorganisms are capable of assimilating cyanide as a              
              source of nutrition, very little is actually known about the                   
              molecular basis of this ability.  Work in our laboratory has shown             
              that bacteria capable of utilizing cyanide as a sole nitrogen                  
              source occur readily in nature, but the mechanism of assimilation              
              is unknown.  Other investigations have indicated that assimilation             
              is oxygenase-mediated, but this has yet to be confirmed.  The                  
              present work is aimed at further defining the metabolic basis of               
              this ability by (i) chemically identifying conversion products,                
              (ii) identifying the kinds of enzymatic activities responsible for             
              conversion, and (iii) identifying the combination of chemical                  
              (e.g., radiolabelling, 13C-NMR), biochemical (e.g.,                            
              biotransformation assays, inhibitor studies, SDS-PAGE) and genetic             
              approaches (mutant analysis).  New information on the fundamental              
              microbial basis of cyanide metabolism is expected, which given the             
              importance of cyanide as both an environmental toxicant and                    
              participant in prebiotic evolution, is of significant scientific               
              merit.//
