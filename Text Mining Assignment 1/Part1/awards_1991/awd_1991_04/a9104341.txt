Abstract    :
              This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant                   
              biology for two years.  The project entitled "Biosynthesis of N-               
              acylphosphatidylethanolamine" is to be carried out in the                      
              laboratory of Dr. Thomas Moore at Louisiana State University. The              
              fellow's Ph.D. thesis work concerned the cell biology of                       
              glyoxysomes in cotton.  In his postdoctoral training, Dr. Chapman              
              will focus on the biochemistry of lipid biosynthesis in soybean.               
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Plant Biology are designed to                  
              increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant                
              biology.
