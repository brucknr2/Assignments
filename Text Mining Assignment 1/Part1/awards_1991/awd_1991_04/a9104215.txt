Abstract    :
              This is a project to develop a morphological genetic map of                    
              embryo lethal mutations of Arabidopsis thaliana.  There are a                  
              large number of genes involved in embryo development and the                   
              objective of this project is to map 100 mutants that have been                 
              accumulated in Dr. Meinke's laboratory.  The value of having a                 
              genetic map will increase as an increasing number of laboratories              
              are working with embryonic lethal mutants.  This work will                     
              provide a valuable resource of mutant genes with known map                     
              locations, and the resultant map will provide a guide to assign                
              each new mutation to complementation groups.  In addition, the                 
              work contributes to the world-wide effort of developing a high                 
              density genetic and physical map of Arabidopsis.
