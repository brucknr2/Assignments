Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Insects, like mammals, use hormones to regulate their body                     
              functions.  In mammals, the digestive system is a major source of              
              hormones.  Increasing evidence indicates that the insect digestive             
              tract also secretes a large number of hormones; the proposed study             
              will focus on these.  Preliminary studies suggest that a hormonal              
              factor from the midgut of the black blowfly, Phormia regina,                   
              activates brain neurosecretory activity after the female fly has               
              taken a sufficient protein meal.  The brain activity then leads to             
              the completion of egg development.  The proposed study will provide            
              comparative information on hormones from insect as well as                     
              mammalian digestive tracts.  It may also provide information for               
              future insect control programs.//
