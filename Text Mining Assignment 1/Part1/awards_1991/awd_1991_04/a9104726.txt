Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The national park model of wildlife conservation has been widely          
              used in many countries.  With population growth and the ensuing increase       
              in pressure on land and resource use, however, conflicts have escalated        
              among local farmers and pastoralists trying to sustain themselves and          
              park officials trying to protect the wildlife as a valuable national and       
              global resource.  This doctoral dissertation project will study two            
              national parks in Kenya in order to illuminate the complex socioeconomic       
              and ecological problems involved in national park wildlife conservation        
              efforts.  Interviews at the levels of family, village, and local               
              conservation officials will be used to identify the social factors that        
              shape the success or failure of conservation.                                  
                                                                                             
                 This project will provide valuable information about the                    
              perceptions and attitudes of local people toward wildlife and how these        
              in turn relate to the role that local people might play in the                 
              conservation of wildlife.  This project also will provide an excellent         
              opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop               
              independent research skills.
