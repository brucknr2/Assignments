Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  There are three principal applications for data recorded by               
              magnetic variometers regionally or globally distributed over the               
              Earth's suface.  These are:  a) large scale regional or global                 
              induction studies of the solid earth, b) solar-terrestrial                     
              physics studies, and c) monitoring of external transient source                
              fields.  This grant focusses on the first application in                       
              describing a regionalized global induction study of the solid                  
              earth.  This research will produce an animated video of two                    
              classes of transient magnetic disturbances important to                        
              electromagnetic induction studies at periods of hours to days,                 
              quiet time solar variations, and storm time magnetic variations.
