Abstract    :
                   The project is concerned with problems of flame propagation               
              in nonuniform flow fields and in confined environments.  The                   
              investigator will derive and analyze appropriate mathematical                  
              models and will study the dynamics of flames in such                           
              configurations.  The methods to be used are asymptotic and                     
              perturbation techniques combined with numerical computations.                  
              The primary goal is to construct solutions that permit a                       
              fundamental understanding of the relevant physical mechanisms                  
              involved in these processes and to enable qualitative comparison               
              with experimental observations.                                                
                   Combustion in closed vessels is a commonly encountered                    
              problem, but it is not well understood.  The results of this                   
              project will provide a better picture of the physics involved and              
              can be used to validate numerical simulations of confined                      
              combustion.
