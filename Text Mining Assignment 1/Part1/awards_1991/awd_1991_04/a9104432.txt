Abstract    :
                   Certain problems arising in molecular biology, in queueing                
              theory, in quality control and in other experimental situations                
              as well, involve sequences of observations and patterns within                 
              the sequences and change of pattern within the sequences.  This                
              research defines a rigorous mathematical framework within which                
              to examine these problems and to bring to bear modern statistical              
              methodologies.  In particular, the research addresses the problem              
              of regression analysis (traditional, robust and/or semilinear) to              
              handle censored or truncated data and to detect change-points                  
              either sequentially or at a predetermined sample size.  In                     
              addition, bootstrap methods for sequential analysis will be                    
              developed and their statistical properties will be investigated.
