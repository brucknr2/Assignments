Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research will investigate biochemical mechanisms related to                
              induction of a cytochrome P450 enzyme in the cockroach fat body by             
              the hypertrehalosemic neurohormone (HTH) is an insect protein                  
              hormone secreted by nerve cells that stimulates the fat body                   
              (=insect "liver") to convert carbohydrate stores to blood sugar                
              (trehalose).  HTH also stimulates expression of a gene for a new               
              member in a family of P450 enzymes traceable in evolution history              
              to the time of divergence of bacteria and higher organisms.  The               
              significance of HTH-dependent P450 will be assessed as it relates              
              to fat body metabolism, and the P450 gene will be isolated and                 
              structurally characterized to identify how HTH controls its                    
              expression.  Cockroaches are one of the oldest living organisms,               
              and since this P450 is one of the oldest genes, studies on HTH                 
              regulation of P450 gene expression in cockroach fat body will                  
              illuminate a fundamental cellular regulatory process that dates to             
              the time of the origin of higher animals.  From a practical view,              
              P450's are the means by which all animals, including  man,                     
              metabolize foreign chemicals such as drugs, toxins, carcinogens and            
              insecticides.  Since many of these compounds are neurotoxic, they              
              may stimulate neuroendocrine cells to release hormones which induce            
              P450 synthesis for metabolism of the toxicant.  Therefore, studies             
              linking neurohormones with P450 synthesis may provide a fundamental            
              explanation for both man's response to carcinogens and insect                  
              resistance to insecticides.//
