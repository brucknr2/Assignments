Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Jaeger will                
              develop and evaluate strategies for stabilizing and                            
              destabilizing vesicle bilayer membranes. The resultant                         
              strategies can be applied in chemical reagent storage and                      
              release. Objectives of the proposed studies include: (i)                       
              synthesis and characterization of new cleavable surfactants,                   
              (ii) characterization of derived vesicles, (iii) determination                 
              of cleavage rates for surfactants in vesicle form, and (iv)                    
              studies of vesicle entrapment and release.                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Vesicles (liposomes) are spherical or ellipsoidal single- and                  
              multicompartment closed bilayer structures formed by dispersion                
              in water of double-chain synthetic and naturally occurring                     
              surfactants. The ability of vesicles to entrap hydrophilic and                 
              hydrophobic compounds in their aqueous compartments and                        
              inhydrocarbon bilayers, respectively, has led to intense                       
              interest in their use as devices for a number of applications,                 
              including chemical reagent storage and release. Enhancements of                
              vesicular storage and release capabililties arise from bilayer                 
              membrane stabilization and destabilization, respectively. In                   
              this project, methods for chemically triggering the destruction                
              of vesicles to release their contents will be explored.
