Abstract    :
              This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant                   
              biology for two years.  The project entitled "Analysis of the                  
              vacuolar membrane inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor ion                     
              channel of guard cells" is to be carried out in the laboratory of              
              Dr. Julian Schroeder at the University of California at San                    
              Diego.  The applicant received his Ph.D. training in the area of               
              plant biochemistry.  In his postdoctoral training, Dr. Ward will               
              focus on the electrophysiology of guard cells in bean and other                
              plants.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Plant Biology are designed to                  
              increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant                
              biology.
