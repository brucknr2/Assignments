Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor Champa Sengupta-Gopalan of                   
              New Mexico State University (NMSU) in a research collaboration                 
              with Professor Georgina Hernandez of the  Nitrogen Fixation                    
              Research Center in Cuernavaca, Mexico.  The main objective of                  
              the research is to determine the molecular and biochemical                     
              basis for the increased nodulation, elevated overall N2                        
              fixation, and increased growth of alfalfa plants whose                         
              rhizospere is infested with the soil micro-organism P. syringae                
              pv. tabaci.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Alfalfa is a major forage crop in both Mexico and the U.S.                     
              and is well adapted to arid and irrigated agriculture in both                  
              nations.  An understanding of the exact mechanisms that                        
              influence symbiotic nitrogen fixation will allow the                           
              development of genetically engineered alfalfa plants for                       
              increased N2 fixation capability.  For this research, various                  
              gene constructs will be made at NMSU and Cuernavaca, and the                   
              nodulation biology will be performed at both laboratories.                     
              In addition, all the biochemical characterization of the                       
              mutant plants will be done at the Los Alamos National                          
              Laboratory.
