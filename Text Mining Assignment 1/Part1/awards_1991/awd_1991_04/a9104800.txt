Abstract    :
                   This award provides half of the funds necessary to acquire a              
              coupled theodolite (for measuring angles) and an electronic                    
              distance measuring device, more commonly referred to as a Total                
              Station. The PI intends to use the Total Station to accurately                 
              measure the location and elevation of the surfaces and contacts of             
              Quaternary sediments and rocks that have been displaced by warping             
              or faulting. These kinds of measurements are a critical part of                
              modern neotectonic research programs. In addition, the Total                   
              Station will be used in the teaching of undergraduate and graduate             
              courses.
