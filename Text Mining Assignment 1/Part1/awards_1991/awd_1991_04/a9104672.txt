Abstract    :
              This research addresses the mobility of closed loop planar and                 
              spherical linkages.  Its intent is to establish a basic theory                 
              and foundation to identify and classify link mobility and joint                
              rotatability of single closed loop N-bar planar and spherical                  
              linkages, and therefore provide a better understanding of the                  
              potential uses and limitations of a linkage or manipulator.  The               
              results are applicable to some spatial linkages directly and to                
              multiple loop linkages.  They may also provide a geometric tool                
              or model to understand the dexterity and geometric constraints                 
              placed on a manipulator when a temporary closed loop chain is                  
              formed.***
