Abstract    :
              The MORB-like isotopic character and extreme diversity of trace                
              element compositions within ALeutian magnesian andesites suggest               
              that these rocks are key to the understanding of magma                         
              generation processes in the Aleutian arc.  While magnesian                     
              andesites are rare in the central and eastern Aleutians, they                  
              are volumetrically important in the western arc where subduction               
              rates are low.  Magnesian andesites are of interest because they               
              include compositions that (apparently) range from melts of nearly              
              pure "mantle wedge" to melts of nearly pure subducting slab.                   
              This project is to determine the composition of the mantle wedge               
              and quantify the contributions of subducting slab and mantle                   
              wedge components to more common magmatic rocks of the central and              
              eastern arc.  Determinations of mineral and whole-rock major                   
              element, trace element, and isotope (Sr, Nd, Pb) compositions                  
              will be sufficient to characterize magnesian andesites within the              
              familiar framework of "normal" Aleutian magmatic rocks.
