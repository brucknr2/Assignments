Abstract    :
                   The proposers will use a unique collection of crustal                     
              deformation observations to create an improved picture of fault-               
              zone kinematics, and thus better understand fault-zone mechanics.              
              With the vast increase in such data expected from GPS measurements,            
              it makes sense to find out now, using existing data, what science              
              we can get from them and also the best ways of collecting,                     
              combining, and interpreting them.  They will mostly focus on the               
              San Jacinto fault, in southern California-a well-instrumented area             
              that is in the later part of its interseismic interval, with a                 
              moderate-to-large earthquake relatively likely.
