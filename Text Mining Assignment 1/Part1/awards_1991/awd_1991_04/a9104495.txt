Abstract    :
                   Eastern New England is now recognized to consist of a number              
              of exotic terranes joined to ancestral North America along large               
              faults.  However, the timing of the accretion of these terranes is             
              in a state of flux.  This project will gather thermometric and                 
              barometric data from both sides of these terrane bounding faults               
              and together with existing age determinations will assess the                  
              possibility of major Alleghenian motion, not previously recognized.            
              Results have the potential to provide a major re-interpretation of             
              the timing of terrane accretion in New England.
