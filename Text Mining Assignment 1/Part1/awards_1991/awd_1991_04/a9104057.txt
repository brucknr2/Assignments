Abstract    :
                   This project involves the use and development of microlocal               
              techniques to study three categories of nonlinear wave phenomena:              
              diffraction by smooth obstacles, diffraction by nonsmooth                      
              obstacles, and transmission from one medium to another.  In all                
              three cases we are concerned with the behavior of singularity-                 
              bearing rays as well as with progressing waves.  The aim is to                 
              produce propagation of regularity theorems along with examples                 
              demonstrating the optimality of those theorems.  In the latter                 
              two categories, the research addresses some basic questions                    
              concerning existence which remain open even in the linear case.
