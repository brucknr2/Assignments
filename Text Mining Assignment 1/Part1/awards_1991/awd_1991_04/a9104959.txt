Abstract    :
                   This award will support the initial phase of development of               
              the ion microprobe facility at the University of California-Los                
              Angeles. During the two-year period of this award a new high-                  
              transmission, high-mass resolution secondary ion microprobe                    
              instrument is to be delivered and commissioned in the Department               
              of Earth and Space Sciences at UCLA. The purchase of the instrument            
              was supported by funds from UCLA, the William Keck Foundation, and             
              the National Science Foundation. The facility will be the first of             
              its kind in the U.S. and will be operated as a national facility               
              available to researchers in geochemistry. The new ion microprobe               
              will have the capability to analyze very small regions of minerals             
              (on the order of ten micrometers) for precise isotopic ratios and              
              will be of particular usefulness in geochronology and geochemical              
              tracer studies.
