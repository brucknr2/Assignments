Abstract    :
                   Well-exposed, thick, marine stratigraphic sections with an                
              abundance of both endemic and cosmopolitan Cambrian fossils are                
              present in western Hunan, China.  Such sections are exceptionally              
              rare for the Cambrian System.  Detailed collaborative study of the             
              paleontology, biostratigraphy, and depositional environments of                
              these Chinese sections is proposed.  Reconnaissance sampling will              
              also be made for stable-isotope analyses.  With such study, the                
              sections are expected to become important references for global                
              biostratigraphic correlation, and possible stable-isotope                      
              correlation.  They also are expected to be strong candidates for               
              selection by the International Commission on Stratigraphy as world             
              stratotypes for some stage and series boundaries within the upper              
              half of the Cambrian System, and possibly as a stratotype for the              
              Cambrian-Ordovician boundary.
