Abstract    :
              During plant transformation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens the virB              
              gene products most likely mediate T-DNA transport across the                   
              bacterial and plant cell membranes and walls.  The long-term                   
              objective of this proposal is to elucidate the role of the eleven              
              virB gene products in the T-DNA transfer process.  The specific                
              aims will examine the following questions: 1) Which virB genes are             
              needed for virulence ? 2) Do VirB proteins compose the T-DNA                   
              transport machinery? and 3) Is phosphorylation involved in                     
              controlling or activating VirB functions? These questions will be              
              addressed using a combination of genetic and biochemical                       
              approaches.  First, VirB-specific antibodies will be raised and A.             
              tumefaciens mutants will be isolated that each lack a different                
              single virB gene.  These antisera and mutants will then be used in             
              combination with cellular fractionation, immunoelectron microscopy,            
              protein cross-linking, site specific mutagenesis, and other                    
              techniques to identify, localize, and functionally characterize the            
              virB gene products.  The results will have immediate significance              
              in providing insight into the mechanism of T-DNA transport.  On a              
              practical level, characterization of virB gene function in                     
              Agrobacterium will likely contribute to understanding the molecular            
              mechanism by which macromolecules are transported across membranes.
