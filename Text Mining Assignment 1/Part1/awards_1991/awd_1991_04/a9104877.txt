Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding for a technician's                    
              position in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University            
              of Michigan. The funds will be used to support a technician for                
              three years. The technician will be responsible for operating and              
              maintaining equipment in the Radiogenic Isotope Geochemistry                   
              Laboratory at Michigan, which is utilized for a wide variety of                
              research projects involving the use of radiogenic isotopes for                 
              dating and tracer studies in crustal fluid flow, silicic magmatism,            
              mantle geochemistry, and paleoceanography.
