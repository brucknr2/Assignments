Abstract    :
              Computational geometry as a field deals with the algorithmic aspects           
              of geometric problems.  Most of the existing research has been                 
              restricted, however, to problems involving straight lines in two               
              dimensions.  The goal of this project is to develop improved                   
              computational methods for both curved objects and three-dimensional            
              objects and then to develop efficient algorithms for a collection of           
              optimization problems, including inner and outer approximation of              
              curved and three-dimensional objects, three-dimensional mesh                   
              generation, and pre-fabrication partitioning of both rectilinear and           
              fixed-orientation of VLSI designs.
