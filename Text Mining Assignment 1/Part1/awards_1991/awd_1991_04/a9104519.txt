Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the geometric structure of                
              conformal field theory.  The principal investigator will study                 
              the following topics: (1) binary trees and the Lie bracket; (2)                
              determinant line bundles and vertex operator algebras; (3) a                   
              geometric proof of duality for more than two twisted elements;                 
              (4)  an abstract form of the geometric definitions of finite                   
              dimensional Lie algebras, vertex operator algebras and higher                  
              dimensional quantum field theory; (5) exponentiating vertex                    
              operator algebras; (6) exponentiations of vertex operator                      
              algebras and elliptic cohomology.                                              
                   The research supported concerns an important focus of                     
              current mathematical activity, where group representation theory,              
              quantum field theory, and algebraic geometry all come together.                
              This work has important implications for theoretical physics, as               
              well as several areas of mathematics.
