Abstract    :
                   This project proposes to develop "second-generation" models               
              of the fluid flow occurring near the top od the Earth's liquid                 
              outer core, using global geomagnetic data as the input                         
              observations.  Customary assumptions, to be retained here, are that            
              (i) the mantle is either an insulator, or a weak, radially                     
              symmetric conductor; (ii) the mantle is a spherical annulus; (iii)             
              the core fluid is inviscid and incompressible.  The new, ore                   
              realistic features to be included are the following: the core flow             
              is unsteady, the core fluid is finitely conducting, and the input              
              geomagnetic field model contains errors.  The work will require a              
              sequence of steps: completion of the basic theory, construction of             
              an appropriate geomagnetic field model, implementation of the                  
              theory, and interpretation and inference from the resulting flow               
              pattern.
