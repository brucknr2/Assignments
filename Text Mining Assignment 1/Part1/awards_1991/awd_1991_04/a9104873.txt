Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research will be undertaken on a number of problems in electronic              
              many-body theory, complexity and disordered systems.  Topic to be              
              studied include: high temperature superconductors and related                  
              problems such as the Hubbard model in one and two dimensions;                  
              disordered electronic and magnetic systems including breakdown of              
              Fermi liquid behavior in quenched random systems; physics of                   
              complexity and problems of early evolution.                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Electronic many-body theory as usually practiced has been                      
              challenged by phenomena such as high temperature superconductors in            
              which usual /perturbative techniques haved been found lacking.  The            
              complex interactions in these materials between magnetism,                     
              disorder, superconductivity and metal-insulator transitions have               
              led to the need for new paradigms.  The research proposed here will            
              address the fundamdental behavior of electrons in these highly                 
              usual systems.  Addition work will be devoted to the application of            
              spin glass models to pre-biotic evolution.
