Abstract    :
                   Professor Stevens will work on special values of L-functions              
              and their relations to arithmetic geometry.  He intends to                     
              continue working on the exceptional zero conjecture of Mazur,                  
              Tate and Teitelbaum.  He also plans to work on modular symbols.                
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
