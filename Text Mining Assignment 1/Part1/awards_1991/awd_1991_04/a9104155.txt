Abstract    :
                   The proposed research is focused on a new computational                   
              method developed for solving variational problems with a large,                
              possibly infinite, set of constraints.  An investigation of                    
              various aspects of this method is proposed, with emphasis on the               
              error analysis, discretization techniques, generalizations and                 
              convergence acceleration.  On the basis of this method                         
              computational algorithms are expected to be developed for a class              
              of equilibrium and slow evolution problems and for evolution                   
              problems with a large number of conservation laws.  A large class              
              of applications in physics and engineering is proposed for the                 
              investigation with the help of these computational                             
              algorithms. Applied problems include problems in ideal                         
              magnetohydrodynamics (tokamak design, analysis of the                          
              experimental data), fluid dynamics (design of efficient                        
              computational algorithms with improved convergence and stability               
              properties) and astrophysics.                                                  
                   The variational approach is also proposed for developing                  
              numerical methods for finding periodic solutions of nonlinear                  
              wave equation and quasi-periodic solutions of second order                     
              dynamical systems.
