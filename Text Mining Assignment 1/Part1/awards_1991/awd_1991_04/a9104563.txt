Abstract    :
                   This grant is for support of research focused on projects to              
              study the properties and processes associated with pressure                    
              dependence of the elastic properties of high-pressure phases.                  
              These experiments will be performed using existing analytical                  
              facilities in the Mineral Physics Institute and the large-volume,              
              high pressure facilities of the Stony Brook High Pressure                      
              Laboratory.
