Abstract    :
                   This award will provide half of the funding to make it                    
              possible for Caltech to acquire a new four-crystal spectrometer for            
              their electron microprobe. This new four-crystal spectrometer                  
              contains state-of-the-art layered dispersion element pseudocrystals            
              that enable analysis of very light elements (beryllium through                 
              carbon) with high efficiency. Caltech is committed to provide the              
              additional funds needed for this acquisition.                                  
                   The acquisition of this state-of-the-art spectrometer/crystal             
              system will (1) significantly improve the PIs capability to analyze            
              Be, B, and C which will be of importance for a variety of geologic             
              investigations such as determining the carbon dioxide content of               
              glasses and B substitution in silicates; and (2) enable these                  
              investigators to develop superior quantitative analysis correction             
              procedures for the very light elements and soft X-ray lines. As in             
              the past, these investigators indicate that they plan to make these            
              correction procedures widely available to other interested                     
              investigators.
