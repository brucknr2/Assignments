Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Hoisch            
              (Northern Arizona University), will study metamorphic rocks of the             
              Big Maria Mountains in southeastern California using petrologic                
              and isotopic techniques.  The investigation will help geologists               
              to understand fluid flow and fluid-rock interaction in rocks that              
              have undergone metamorphism at mid-crustal depths in the Earth.
