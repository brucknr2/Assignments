Abstract    :
                                                                   9104984  Cole           
              This is the third year funding of a three-year continuing award.  The ability
              to perform fine  phonetic distinctions is a fundamental unsolved problem in
              computer speech recognition.  Spoken  letter recognition has practical
              applications and requires discrimination of acoustically similar words.   An
              existing system will be improved in the following areas:  (a) isolated letter
              recognition, (b)  multiple letter recognition (sequences separated by brief
              pauses), and (c) continuous letter recognition  (naturally spelled words).  The
              result of this research will be a highly accurate, speaker-independent  system
              that retrieves words from spellings.  Strategies for improving isolated letter
              recognition  include improving the signal representation and the broad category
              segmentation algorithm.  Better  letter segmentation strategies will be
              developed for those cases when the speaker does not pause as  requested. 
              Two-level classification will allow consideration of all possible letter
              sequences in  conjunction with discrimination of whole-letter classification as
              in isolated letter recognition systems.   Coarticulation models will be
              introduced to recognize between phoneme transitions, including  dynamically
              adjusted duration models and boundary detection.
