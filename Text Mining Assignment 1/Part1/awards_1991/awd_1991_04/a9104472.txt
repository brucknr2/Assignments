Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the design and development of                  
              numerical methods for modeling fluid interfaces and the                        
              application of these methods to the study of fundamental problems              
              in fluid mechanics.  An important goal of this work is to develop              
              accurate and efficient algorithms for modeling three dimensional               
              problems.  The interface tracking algorithms considered are                    
              generally of the volume-of-fluid type.  Some generalizations of                
              this type of algorithm, based on conservative shock tracking                   
              ideas, are also considered.  These algorithms will be used, in                 
              conjunction with adaptive mesh refinement and high order                       
              numerical methods for approximating solutions of the compressible              
              Euler equations, to study shock wave refraction and the                        
              Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.  In addition, they will also be                 
              used with a second order projection method to study the Rayleigh-              
              Taylor instability in incompressible flow.                                     
                                                                                             
              Studies of fluid dynamics have a long and honorable history, with              
              many applications in engineering, earth and ocean sciences, among              
              others.
