Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     The heat.flow/basement depth relation, which favors the                
              simple thermal boundary layer model, will be tested to determine               
              if it actually is applicable to older oceanic areas.  To                       
              document this, heat flow will be documented in the Late Jurassic               
              ocean floor of western Gulf of Mexico using both heat.flow                     
              measurements acquired during a proposed R/V Gyre cruise and also               
              analyzing the radioactivity of DSDP 90 and 91 sites to determine               
              the effect of radiogenic heat from 10 km of sediments on the                   
              surface heat flux.  Seismic refraction and reflection data will                
              be used to compute the water.loaded basement and the possible                  
              effect of thinner.than.normal crust on this depth.
