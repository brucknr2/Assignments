Abstract    :
              This study will involve:  1) Detailed sulfur and reconnaissance                
              O-H isotopic analyses designed to delineate MVT provinces and                  
              constrain sources of mineralizing brines and sulfur, 2)                        
              evaluation of newly designed 87Sr/86Sr dating method for                       
              sphalerite, and application of this method to determine the age                
              of MVT mineralization.  These data will be used to determine the               
              relation between MVT mineralization, foreland basin development,               
              and deformation in the southern and central Appalachians, and to               
              test the possibility that significant fluid migration and                      
              possible MAT mineralization preceded the Late Paleozoic                        
              Alleghenian orogeny.   The results should provide insights into                
              the genesis of MAT mineralization, the timing of brine movement                
              in collisional margin basins, and mechanisms of basinal brine                  
              expulsion.
