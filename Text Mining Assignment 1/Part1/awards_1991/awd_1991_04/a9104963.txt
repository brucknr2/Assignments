Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of this research program is to elucidate the physico-                  
              chemical properties of individual binding of multi-site                        
              macromolecules and to develop a new thermodynamic theory for                   
              the description of site-specific energetics.                                   
                                                                                             
              Dr. Di Cera will explore the way individual sites are coupled                  
              to each other, and the way their properties relate to those of                 
              the macromolecule as a whole and how the cooperativity patterns                
              arising locally form site-site interactions translate in the                   
              global cooperative behavior of the macromolecule as a whole.
