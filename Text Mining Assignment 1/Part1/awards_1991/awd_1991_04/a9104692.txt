Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% of the funds required to obtain a                 
              computer system to be installed and operated in the Department of              
              Geosciences at the University of Arizona. The University is                    
              committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for this                  
              acquisition.                                                                   
                   The computer equipment will be used primarily by the                      
              earthquake seismology research group at the University of Arizona.             
              The research conducted by the group includes a broad range of                  
              topics, all requiring intensive computer applications: Earth                   
              structure, seismic source parameters, nuclear discrimination and               
              verification, and seismic hazards.
