Abstract    :
              The long-term objective of this research is to determine the growth            
              conditions that limit the structural perfection of protein crystals            
              and, thus, the structural information obtainable by diffraction                
              techniques.  Towards this end, the growth kinetics of selected                 
              proteins will be studied and correlated to growth morphology and               
              x-ray diffraction resolution.  The growth kinetics and morphology              
              will be investigated in a temperature controlled microscope-stage              
              growth cell using transmission differential interference contrast              
              and reflection interference microscopy in combination with                     
              digital image processing.
