Abstract    :
                   This award partially supports the 1991 Gordon Research                    
              Conference on Statistics in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering.                
              The award will supplement funding provided by the special fund of              
              the Summer Gordon Research Conference to provide travel and                    
              subsistence expenses for the scientists who will be speakers and               
              discussants.                                                                   
                   The 1991 Gordon Research Conference will involve leading                  
              statisticians, chemists, and chemical engineers from industry,                 
              government, and universities and from other countries.  The                    
              presentation and discussion will focus on innovative research                  
              ideas in applied statistics used in the analysis of chemical                   
              phenomena.
