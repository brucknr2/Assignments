Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of a variety of paramagnetic                
              metalloproteins are proposed in order to extract unique                        
              electronic/molecular structural information from the hyperfine                 
              shifts as relevant to the formation of ligation channels in                    
              proteins, the control of redox potential of electron mediators,                
              and the detection of intermediates in the unfolding of                         
              proteins.  Central to all of these studies is the development                  
              and implementation of two-dimensional NMR strategies, that will                
              provide the critical assignments for the paramagnetically                      
              relaxed, broadened and shifted resonances.  Changes in labile                  
              proton exchange rates upon mutation/chemical modification in                   
              the distal heme pocket of cyano-metmyoblobin will be used to                   
              define the interactions that allows formation of a transient                   
              ligation channel to the heme pocket.  The influence of heme                    
              orientation and hydrogen bonding by an axial histidine on heme                 
              electronic structure will be elucidated for cytochrome b5, and                 
              the origins of the pKs that modulate the redox potential of                    
              cytochrome b562 will be identified.  The contact shifted                       
              resonance of bound cysteines in a variety of iron-sulfur                       
              cluster electron mediators will be assigned to specific                        
              residues in the protein sequence, and the valence states of                    
              individual irons in the cluster will be interpreted on the                     
              basis of available X-ray crystal structure to elucidate the                    
              mechanism of protein control of localized iron redox potential.                
              The heme and axial histidine resonances of high-spin                           
              ferricytochromes c' will be assigned to interpret the nature                   
              of the equilibrium pre-transition structural changes detected                  
              during reversible thermal unfolding.
