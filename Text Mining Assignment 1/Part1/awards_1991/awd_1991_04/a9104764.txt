Abstract    :
                This research is to determine the S-wave velocity structure of               
              the subducting Kurile and Japan lithospheric slabs using                       
              differential residual sphere procedures.  Past studies have                    
              concentrated mainly on P-wave velocity structure, and considerable             
              controversy continues about the results, especially whether the                
              slab penetrates the lower mantle.  S-waves are more difficult to               
              measure but are now accessible because of advances in                          
              instrumentation.  S-waves are more sensitive to the thermal and                
              chemical structure of the slab and may help resolve fundamental                
              questions about mantle dynamics.
