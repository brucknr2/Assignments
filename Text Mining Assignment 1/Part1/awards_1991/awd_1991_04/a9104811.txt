Abstract    :
              The Department of Experimental Statistics at Louisiana State                   
              University will purchase a large capacity workstation with fast                
              numerical computation speed which will be dedicated to support                 
              research in applied statistics.  The research is varied,                       
              reflecting the range of research interests within the Department.              
              Escobar plans to investigate new experimental designs for an area              
              of great interest to industry, accelerated reliability testing.                
              LaMotte plans to study techniques for generalizing model fitting               
              in regression analysis such that variable selection and outlier                
              identification proceed simultaneously.  Moser plans fundamental                
              research into the nature of factor analysis, investigating robust              
              estimation and diagnostics.  The equipment will be used to                     
              support other research as CPU time permits.
