Abstract    :
                   The proposed one year project will explore high performance               
              architectures applicable to realizing optical WAN switches.  Some              
              of the major drawbacks of currently proposed high speed "optical"              
              switches are the need for rapidly tunable transmitters or receivers            
              requiring fast control for contention resolution and for                       
              transmitter-receiver coordination.  Alternatively, current                     
              architectures based on the use of fixed transmitters and receivers,            
              as in a Shuffle, result in good performance only for homogeneous               
              traffic patterns and do not smoothly adapt to component failures.              
                   The principle of the proposed solution is the use of                      
              wavelength or frequency routing, in a way which trades the high                
              bandwidth of these technologies for simplifying the processing and             
              hardware switch requirements.  the proposed solution integrates                
              time oriented control with wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)              
              targeted to overcome the above limitations.  The objective of the              
              one year effort will be to explore the major issues that restrict              
              WDM/TDM (time division multiplexing) operations and propose a                  
              preliminary switch architecture.  The operation of the proposed                
              system will be evaluated through simulation to provide a                       
              quantitative measure for evaluating the future potential of the                
              proposed approach.
