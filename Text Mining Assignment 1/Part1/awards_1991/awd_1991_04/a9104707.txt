Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The evolution of the Actinopterygii (ray finned fish) has proceeded            
              in three stages.  The first group were the Chondrostei.  This group            
              was succeeded by the Holostean fishes which were superceded by the             
              Teleosts, the most diverse group of living vertebrates.  The fossil            
              record indicates that Holostean fish were the ancestors to the                 
              Teleosts.  Only two genera of Holosteans have survived (Amia and               
              Lepisosteus).  Amia is a "living fossil."   This proposal will                 
              focus on the biochemical characterization of several pituitary                 
              hormones found in Amia using state of the art techniques of protein            
              analysis and genetic engineering.  These hormones will be compared             
              with those of more "advanced" fishes.  Holosteans are commercially             
              important and the study may provide insights into ways to better               
              manage this fishery.   //
