Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The overall objective of the proposed multidisciplinary                        
              research is to determine the basic physiologic signaling                       
              processes mediating brainstem mechanisms involved in                           
              coordinating neural, endocrine and behavioral determinants of                  
              nutrient homeostasis and ingestive behavior.  Specifically,                    
              the proposed research will focus on brainstem mechanisms                       
              mediated by the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) - its                      
              central role as an integrating site in the brainstem for                       
              coordinating neural and humoral nutrient-related signals with                  
              the consequent production of appropriate viscerobehavioral                     
              response patterns.  Our general hypothesis is that the                         
              integration of nutrient-related information and the                            
              coordination of appropriate homeostatic response patterns by                   
              the NTS occurs at both the afferent limb and the efferent                      
              limb of the neural organizational network mediating feeding                    
              behavior, nutrient homeostasis and metabolic regulation.  The                  
              general hypothesis exploits the observation that the NTS is                    
              not only the principal recipient site in the CNS of first-                     
              order afferent input from the vast array of visceral sensory                   
              receptors involved in nutrient homeostasis, but the NTS also                   
              has extensive direct reciprocal connections with virtually                     
              all structures at every level of the neural axis involved in                   
              nutrient homeostasis, metabolic regulation and  feeding                        
              behavior.  Thus, our specific hypotheses are that the NTS                      
              subserves the following multiple roles in nutrient                             
              homeostasis:  (1) a chemosensory role for nutrient-related                     
              signals in the blood or CSF, likely mediated via its                           
              association with the area postrema (AP); (2) an integrative                    
              role for coordinating visceral sensations mediated by both                     
              neural and humoral signals transmitted to the NTS mainly via                   
              the vagus nerve; (3) a major role as an autonomic control                      
              center in the brainstem for the production of "short-loop"                     
              homeostatic response patterns; and (4) an effector role for                    
              some components of feeding behavior.                                           
                                                                                             
              The two Black American and three White American scientists                     
              who work on this project, will employ a multidisciplinary and                  
              collaborative research strategy with investigators                             
              working cooperatively so that NTS-mediated mechanisms of                       
              nutrient homeostasis can be simultaneously examined at                         
              multiple levels of analysis - from events occurring at the                     
              cellular and tissue level to relatively complex appetitive                     
              responses at the behavioral level.
