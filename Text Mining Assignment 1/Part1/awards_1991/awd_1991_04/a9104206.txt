Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Xenopus oocyte/mRNA injection system has provided a critical               
              key to the characterization and cloning of cDNAs for various animal            
              neurotransmitter receptors.  Dr. Sutton proposes that this system              
              can be used in an analogous manner for the study of plant hormone              
              (phytohormone) receptors.  The specific aim of this proposal is to             
              test the hypothesis that plant mRNA injected into Xenopus oocytes              
              will result in the synthesis and incorporation of phytohormone                 
              receptors into the Xenopus oocyte plasma membrane, and that these              
              receptors will couple to the Xenopus oocyte second messenger                   
              systems.  RNA will be isolated from the barley aleurone layer which            
              is known to be responsive to various phytohormones.  The RNA will              
              be injected into Xenopus oocytes and the oocytes allowed to                    
              incubate for 3-5 days.  The successful synthesis and incorporation             
              of the receptors into the oocyte membrane will be tested by                    
              monitoring for phytohormone-induced chloride currents in the                   
              membrane of the oocytes by the two-electrode voltage clamp                     
              technique and by radio-labelled hormone binding studies.                       
                                                                                             
              If this approach is successful, the results of this research will              
              facilitate the cloning and characterization of plant hormone                   
              receptors which have proven elusive to more traditional biochemical            
              approaches.  The expression or lack of expression of plant hormone             
              receptors in this animal cell system should also provide                       
              significant information about protein sorting to the plasma                    
              membrane.
