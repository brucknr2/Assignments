Abstract    :
                   This project will focus on local and asymptotic behavior of               
              nonlinear degenerate or singular evolution equations.  Local                   
              regularity, appearance of singularities, and intrinsic local and               
              global versions of Harnack type of estimates will be attempted.                
              It is anticipated that questions concerning new type of weak                   
              solutions and intriguing aspects of parabolic equations with                   
              limiting Sobolev exponent will have to be analyzed.                            
                   The equations to be studied arise as models of nonlinear                  
              phenomena such as fast diffusion in plasma, transition of phase,               
              and flow of immiscible fluids in a porus medium.  Problems                     
              concerning coating of metal surfaces with colloidal fluids and                 
              conduction-convection will be considered.
