Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant supports the Mid-Atlantic Drosophila Stock Center at                
              Bowling Green State University.  This center contains over 4,000               
              genetic stocks of Drosophila melanogaster and a small number of                
              lines of the eight melanogaster subgroup species.   The center                 
              maintains and distributes flies to researchers and teachers from               
              all over the world.  It also provide them with information                     
              through telephone, letters, printed catalogues, and computerized               
              information system.  These stocks include basic mutants as well                
              as complex mutant combinations and chromosome rearrangements that              
              are used in genetic, molecular biology, and many other types of                
              biological research, and are an important tool for teaching                    
              genetics in colleges and high schools.
