Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A major function of the brain is to initiate and direct an                     
              individual's behaviors.  While behaviors are controlled by                     
              dispersed groups of highly intertwined neurons, the particular                 
              neurons responsible for particular behaviors have not been                     
              identified.  This problem remains unsolved simply because there                
              are so many neurons and their possible interconnections are so                 
              complex that the task seems Herculean.  Dr. Coquelin's aim is to               
              unravel this tangle by capitalizing on some recent advances in                 
              the fields of behavioral genetics and developmental biology.  He               
              has selected two different strains of inbred mice that differ in               
              their expression of some specific hormonally induced behaviors.                
              Dr. Coquelin will combine very young embryos from these two                    
              different inbred strains.  The offspring, referred to as                       
              chimeras, will possess a mosaic of cells in all tissues,                       
              including the brain.  When they mature, the mice will perform the              
              kind of behavior according to the type of neurons which were                   
              inherited from the particular genetic strain.  The origin of                   
              these neurons will be identified by immunocytochemical                         
              procedures.  Thus, generating chimeras will enable him to                      
              identify the sets of neurons which are responsible for some                    
              genetically determined hormone-regulated behaviors.  Such                      
              information eventually will help us locate and fix behavioral                  
              abnormalities which may arise congenitally, from disease, or                   
              accidentally.
