Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant                   
              biology for two years.  The project entitled "Gene expression                  
              during DNA endoreduplication in Maize endosperm development" is                
              to be carried out in the laboratory of Ronald L. Phillips at                   
              University of Minnesota.  The applicant, whose Ph.D. training                  
              focused on the traditional genetics and breeding of potato, will               
              carry out the molecular cytogenetics studies of endosperm                      
              development in corn.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Plant Biology are designed to                  
              increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant                
              biology.
