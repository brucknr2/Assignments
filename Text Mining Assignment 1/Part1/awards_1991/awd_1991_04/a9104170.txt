Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will examine the capacity of muscle to do work, and               
              will characterize the physiological factors that determine the                 
              capacity for work output.  Particular attention will be given to               
              quantifying the work required to stretch active muscles, since                 
              during normal activities muscles both shorten and are stretched,               
              and some part of the mechanical work output of muscles in vivo is              
              done in extending antagonistic muscles after their period of                   
              shortening.//
