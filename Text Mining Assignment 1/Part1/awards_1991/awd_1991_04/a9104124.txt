Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out in                       
              fundamental electroweak interactions and in the                                
              electromagnetic structure of the nucleon.  The former studies                  
              will be conducted at TRIUMF in Canada and involve radiative                    
              muon capture in hydrogen.  A much improved determination of                    
              the induced pseudoscalar weak interaction coupling constant                    
              will be obtained and will be used to test the Goldberger-                      
              Treiman relation in weak interactions.  The electric and                       
              magnetic polarizabilities of the proton and neutron will be                    
              determined in another experiment using Compton scattering of                   
              linearly polarized gammas available at the Brookhaven National                 
              Lab Laser Electron (backscattering) Gamma Source.  Results                     
              from the latter work will be compared to calculations based on                 
              fundamental quantum chromo-dynamics.
