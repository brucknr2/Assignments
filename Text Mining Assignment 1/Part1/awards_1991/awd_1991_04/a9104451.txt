Abstract    :
                   The carbon isotopic composition of Cenozoic (8 to 56 Myr)                 
              paleosol carbonates is significantly different than Mesozoic                   
              paleosol carbonates, having   C values of about - 10 to - 12 permil            
              (118 samples) and -6 to -8 permil (21 samples), respectively.  In              
              this preliminary data set there is only one data point that                    
              overlaps.  Consideration of the possible causes for this distinct              
              differences leads to a possible difference in the concentration of             
              atmospheric CO2 .  If this is true it could lead to a method to                
              estimate P(CO2) in the atmosphere to at least 200 Ma ago, greatly              
              extending our knowledge of paleoatmospheric chemistry.  So far,                
              direct measurements of paleo-CO2  measurements go back only 0.16               
              Ma (Barnola, et al., 1987).                                                    
                   The isotopic composition of soil carbonate records the                    
              isotopic composition of soil CO2  which is directly related to the             
              concentration of CO2  in the atmosphere.  For modern soils the                 
              atmospheric contribution to total soil CO2  is almost negligible.              
              However, higher atmospheric P(CO2) levels make a significant                   
              difference in the isotopic composition of soil CO2 and hence, soil             
              carbonate formed in equilibrium with soil CO2.  In this study we               
              examine the isotopic composition of paleosol carbonates from the               
              Mesozoic and Cenozoic with the aim of determining P(CO2) of the                
              ancient atmosphere.  Preliminary results suggest that this is a                
              viable approach and that Mesozoic CO2 levels were significantly                
              higher than today, on the order of 1500 to 2500 ppmV.
