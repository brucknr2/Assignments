Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's will collect and analyze high-resolution             
              hydrographic and nutrient data at 235 stations along 32 degrees                
              South as part of the South Pacific component of the World Ocean                
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program.  Preliminary               
              analysis of the data will begin by focusing on studies of western              
              boundary currents, meridional heat flux, thermocline circulation,,             
              and deep circulation.  The section will overlie two current meter              
              arrays off Australia and New Zealand, allowing this to be one of               
              the primary flux lines for WOCE.
