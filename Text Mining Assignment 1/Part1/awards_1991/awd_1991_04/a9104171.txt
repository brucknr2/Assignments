Abstract    :
              The proposed research is part of a unified plan, in progress since             
              1968, to increase knowledge of the classification, phylogeny, and              
              biogeography of harpaline carabid beetles (Carabidae:  Coleoptera).            
              The project includes three species level revisions:  (1) the 30                
              species of the nominate subgenus of Anisodactylus; (2) the eight               
              species of the subgenus Anadaptus (genus Anisodactylus); and (3)               
              the approximately 25 North American and probably also the                      
              approximately 25 species from elsewhere of the subgenus Stenolophus            
              (genus Stenolophus).  Completion of the three species level                    
              revisions will allow accurate identification of adults of groups               
              possibly suitable for monitoring of environmental changes in                   
              wetlands.  The three groups were selected because comparison of                
              data from the three studies will provide insights into                         
              biogeographical topics such as:  (1) production of new species in              
              refuges; (2) vicariance (splitting of ancestral species by the                 
              development of geographical barriers) induced by the Cochise                   
              Filter/barrier in the south western United States; (3) changes in              
              geographical ranges over time; and (4) differences in distribution             
              patterns of taxa in areas with and areas without once extensive                
              lowland Wisconsin glaciation.  Data from the present study will be             
              combined with that from a former study of the genus Harpalus to                
              propose and test general models for the evolution of new species               
              of North American carabid beetles.
