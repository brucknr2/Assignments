Abstract    :
                   This proposal deals with problems related to oscillatory                  
              integrals, several complex variables, singular integral                        
              operators, mathematical physics, boundary-value problems, Hardy                
              space theory, and the interrelation of these topics.  The                      
              proposal involves also intense collaboration with a group of                   
              mathematicians at Princeton and at other institutions, including               
              the mentoring of doctoral students and postdoctoral associates.                
              In particular, Professor Stein will continue his work on singular              
              Radon transforms and oscillatory integrals, multi-parameter                    
              harmonic analysis, Fourier integral operators, and Hardy spaces                
              and boundary-value problems for the Laplace operator.  Professor               
              Fefferman will continue working on asymptotic formulas for the                 
              ground-state energy of a large atom, nodal sets and                            
              eigenfunctions for the Laplace operator, conformal invariants,                 
              and delta-bar problems in several complex variables.
