Abstract    :
              This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant                   
              biology for two years.  The project entitled "Genetic analysis of              
              the developmental responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to mechanical              
              stress" is to be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Ronald W.                
              Davis, Stanford University.  This represents a significant change              
              in the field for this Fellow who studied the molecular genetics                
              of Yeast.  During the tenure of this fellowship, her research                  
              will focus on the regulation of gene expression in response to                 
              environmental signals in Arabidopsis.                                          
                                                                                             
              The postdoctoral fellowships in plant biology are designed to                  
              increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant                
              biology.
