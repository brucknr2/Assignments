Abstract    :
                   This research involves the further development of a technique             
              originally developed for the purpose of locating disagreements                 
              between remotely located large files using a minimum of                        
              communication.  The technique has been found to be quite effective             
              for outer code decoding of concatenated codes for error control                
              over a noisy channel.  The code rules are rather arbitrary, and yet            
              correction of almost cases of d-2 or fewer outer code symbol errors            
              is possible with a decoding complexity which increases no faster               
              that as the cube of the block length.  Two areas are emphasized in             
              this project. one area relates to the implications and relative                
              advantages of using the new technique in various error control                 
              coding applications.  The other area relates to the investigation              
              of applications to various problems of communication, maintenance,             
              and verification of the identity of replicated remote files in an              
              efficient manner.
