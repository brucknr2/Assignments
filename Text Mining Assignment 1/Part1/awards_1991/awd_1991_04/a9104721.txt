Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, the PI will obtain measurements of Chlorofluoro-              
              carbons on a line along 135 degrees West in the Pacific from 35                
              degrees N to 35 degrees S.  This line is designated as P-17C, and              
              is part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) one-time              
              survey of the ocean.  Data will be used to study circulation and               
              mixing in the eastern tropical/subtropical Pacific Ocean.
