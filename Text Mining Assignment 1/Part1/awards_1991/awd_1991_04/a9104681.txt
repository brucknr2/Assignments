Abstract    :
              A meeting "The Fourth International Meeting on Ciliate Molecular               
              Biology"  will be held June 9-13, 1991 in Asilomar, California.                
              The meeting will bring together scientists of all ages and of many             
              different interests who are using ciliates as experimental                     
              organisms.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Many of these scientists would not usually attend the same meetings            
              and in the encouraging environment of Asilomar, will interact and              
              discuss problems of comment interest.***//
