Abstract    :
                    Because the lower creust is hot,lower crustal flow should                
              be rapid. Yet rapid crustal flow is not considered in existing                 
              models of continental extension and passive margin formation.                  
              The PI proposes to develop theoretical models that approximate                 
              the temporal evolution of strain in regions where the crust                    
              flows rapidly, and then compare the results with geologic and                  
              geophysical data from the Aegean margin and the Valencia margin                
              south of Spain.
