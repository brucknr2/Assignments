Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this project is to gain further understanding              
              of the geodynamo mechanism.  The PI will carry out further                     
              integrations of the full magnetohydrodynamic dynamo equations,                 
              paying particular attention to the components of the magnetic field            
              that depend on longitude, and will compare their behavior with that            
              of the observed geomagnetic secular variation.  This should lead               
              to a better understanding of core conditions and of the nature of              
              the geodynamo.
