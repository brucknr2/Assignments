Abstract    :
              This project will extend past research on parallel optimization in             
              solving problems with embedded network structures.  The research will          
              be mainly concerned with stochastic network models and multicommodity          
              network flow problems.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The agenda for algorithmic research is to design and analyze                   
              decomposition algorithms for both problem classes.  The agenda for             
              parallel computing is to design implementations of the algorithms for          
              two broad paradigms of parallel computing: coarse-grain MIMD                   
              architectures, and fine-grain massively parallel computing SIMD                
              architectures.  The plan is to implement and evaluate empirically all          
              of the algorithms on: a CRAY Y-MP supercomputer with 8 processors, a           
              Sequent Symmetry S81 with 21 processors and the Connection Machine             
              CM-2 with 32K processors.  The goal is to solve problems with over             
              1 million variables and 500,000 constraints within acceptable solution         
              times, using models derived from real applications.
