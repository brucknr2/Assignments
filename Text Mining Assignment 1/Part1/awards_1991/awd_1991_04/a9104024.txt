Abstract    :
              This project will continue investigations of the phase equilibria              
              of a number of minerals that can provide information as to the                 
              temperature, pressure, and oxygen fugacity under which the rocks               
              containing them crystallized.  An important new thrust is the                  
              inclusion of melting phenomena to provide essential information for            
              thermodynamic modelling of melts.  The approach is to perform                  
              reversed phase-equilibrium experiments and then to apply                       
              thermodynamic solution modelling to the results of those                       
              experiments.  The solution models permit application of the results            
              to compositions, temperatures, pressures, and oxygen fugacities not            
              covered by experiment.
