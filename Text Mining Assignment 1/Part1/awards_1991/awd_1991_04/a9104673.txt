Abstract    :
                   This project involves estimation in unbalanced multivariate               
              variance components models using an approach based on a Fenchel                
              duality formulation of the problem.  The Fenchel approach has been             
              successful in related research projects and is promising for the               
              current project.  The research will concentrate in three areas: 1)             
              estimation and testing of covariance matrices in multivariate                  
              variance component models; 2) integrating results into related                 
              fields of statistics; and 3) studying the rates of convergence of              
              the proposed algorithms.                                                       
                   This project is in the general area of statistics and involves            
              the estimation of variance components in both univariate and                   
              multivariate linear models.   This is an important field of                    
              statistical research.  Many of the multivariate models are now                 
              unavailable to researchers due to the inability of the existing                
              statistical techniques to estimate the variance of components.  The            
              research in this project may have significant impact on the ability            
              to utilize these multivariate models.
