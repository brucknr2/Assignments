Abstract    :
              This award provides partial funding of a workshop in professional              
              communications skills to be held just prior to the national meeting            
              of the American Society for Microbiology, 5 May, 1991.  This                   
              workshop will provide basic training in effective communications               
              skills appropriate for academic science faculty.  These exercises              
              in which the attendees will participate are based on the strategies            
              of neurolinguistic programming (NLP) developed at the University of            
              California by John Grinder and others.  NLP training has been                  
              widely used in professional and organizational development since               
              the late 1970's.  The workshop is especially appropriate for                   
              academic scientists who have little opportunity (compared to their             
              colleagues in the business world) for training in the "people                  
              skills" so important for mentoring, running a research team,                   
              negotiating the steps to promotion and tenure, etc.  Since                     
              effective communication and the ability to manage/motivate others              
              are fundamental prerequisites for professional advancement in every            
              field, this workshop is especially appropriate for women and                   
              minority scientists.
