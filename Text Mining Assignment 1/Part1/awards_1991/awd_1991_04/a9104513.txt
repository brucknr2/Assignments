Abstract    :
                   Professor Natsume's project is in the area of K-theory and                
              cyclic cohomology in noncommutative geometry.  He will study                   
              operator algebras arising from geometry.  Solutions to the problems            
              he poses will illuminate the area of interaction of the two fields.            
              Some of the specific problems he will consider are: (i) determine              
              the structure of the group of diffeomorphisms of a twisted group               
              C*-algebra of the fundamental group of a closed Riemann surface,               
              (ii) determine whether the Baum-Connes conjecture is valid for                 
              codimension one foliations which are almost without holonomy, (iii)            
              generalize the vanishing theorem of the Godbillon-Vey map in                   
              analytical K-theory to higher codimension cases, and (iv) establish            
              a Fourier inversion formula for the canonical cyclic cocycle of a              
              simply connected solvable Lie group.                                           
                   The general area of this project is operator algebras and                 
              geometry.  Operators can be thought of as infinite matrices of                 
              complex numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together            
              in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  Among other              
              problems, Professor Natsume will study operator algebras which                 
              arise in the analysis of closed surfaces.
