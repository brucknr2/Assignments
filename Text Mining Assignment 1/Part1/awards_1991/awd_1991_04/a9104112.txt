Abstract    :
              Unusual structural, electronic, thermodynamic, and reactivity                  
              characteristics of the actinide and related elements will be                   
              determined.  Phenomena to be investigated include metal-ligand                 
              bond enthalpies and reaction thermodynamics,                                   
              metal-heteroelement bond chemistry, ancillary ligand effects                   
              and enantioselective transformations, the activation of                        
              hydrocarbon and related molecules, metal-metalloid and                         
              metal-metal bonds, as well as unusual oxidation states and                     
              ligands.  The long range goal is to understand those structural                
              and electronic factors which modulate chemical reactivity, and                 
              to capitalize on features which stimulate new or enhanced modes                
              of chemical reactivity.

              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Tobin J.                 
              Marks of Northwestern University will continue studies of the                  
              organometallic chemistry of actinide and related elements.  The                
              basic scientific goal is to understand the factors that                        
              determine chemical reactivity, a knowledge that may allow                      
              enhanced reactivity of certain catalyst systems.  The results                  
              may also be of use in dealing with nuclear wastes and learning                 
              more about their effect on the environment.
