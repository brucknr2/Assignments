Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of an X-              
              ray fluorescence spectrometer that will be installed and operated              
              in the Department of Geology at Brigham Young University. The                  
              University is committed to providing matching funds for this                   
              equipment acquisition.                                                         
                   The equipment will be used for rock and mineral analysis in               
              research areas of igneous petrology, economic geology, volcanology,            
              and archeology. Five faculty members and their students in the                 
              Department of Geology have currently active research programs in               
              these areas and need the analytical capabilities of the X-ray                  
              Fluorescence system as an integral part of their research projects.            
              In addition, another ten faculty members at Brigham Young                      
              University have documented occasional need of the instrument for               
              research and teaching projects.
