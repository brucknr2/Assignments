Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will investigate geometric                     
              structures on spaces but will focus much of the research on Mobius             
              structures. A Mobius structure on a space is a group action which              
              acts on the space and comes from the standard structure of                     
              conformal transformations of the sphere. In the two dimensional                
              case a Mobius structure is equivalent to a one dimensional complex             
              projective structure. Professor Kulkarni will study three classes              
              of spaces with Mobius structure and attempt to understand the                  
              underlying geometry of these spaces.                                           
                   The theme of this research is to understand an abstract space             
              by placing additional structure on the space. One simple way of                
              understanding this mathematical tool is to think of a simple closed            
              curve - perhaps twisted in some way. Now if one marks off equal                
              distances on the curve thus creating a metric space, one can talk              
              about the relationship between points on the curve. Thus the curve             
              has been endowed with "additional structure". The principal                    
              investigator will attempt to do something like this but with a much            
              more complicated structure.
