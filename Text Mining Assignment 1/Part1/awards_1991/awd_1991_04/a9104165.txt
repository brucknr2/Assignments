Abstract    :
              The regulation of the light (lt) gene which is located within or               
              very near the heterochromatin of Chromosome 2 of Drosophila                    
              melanogaster will be studied.  When removed from heterochromatin               
              and placed in distal euchromatin by a chromosome rearrangement, the            
              lt gene shows variegated expression.  Using P-element-mediated                 
              transformation, we will determine if a similar  position effect                
              occurs when the gene and its surrounding repetitive sequences are              
              introduced into a variety of chromosomal sites.  The transformed               
              gene will be tested for interactions with known trans-acting                   
              modifiers of variegation.  The transformed middle repetitive                   
              sequences will be examined for properties attributed to                        
              heterochromatin.  We will assay for the ability of these sequences             
              to induce variegation of euchromatic genes or alter chromosome                 
              morphology in polytene tissue.  These studies of position effect               
              variegation address questions about the molecular determinants of              
              chromosomal structure and functional differences between the                   
              heterochromatic and euchromatic chromosomal domains.  The                      
              properties of the heterochromatic lt gene of D. melanogaster will              
              be compared to its euchromatic homolog of    D. virilis to provide             
              insight into the evolutionary mechanisms that                                  
              allow a gene to function in heterochromatin.***//
