Abstract    :
                   The investigator plans to study problems in algebraic and                 
              geometric topology and algebraic K-theory.  These include                      
              studying K-theory parameterized by metric spaces, studying                     
              infinite groups acting on a sphere cross euclidean space,                      
              studying the L-groups of certain infinite groups, and studying                 
              controlled-type surgery theories.                                              
                   Topology arose originally as an approach to the study of                  
              differential equations.  Over the intervening century it has                   
              evolved prodigiously, often seeming to have a life entirely its                
              own and independent of its source.  Increasingly, however, it has              
              begun to repay its debt.  The point is that it is often more                   
              important to know of the solution of an equation whether it is a               
              closed loop or whether it is knotted, for example, than to know                
              precisely and numerically what are the coordinates of all its                  
              points.  Furthermore, although the former qualitative information              
              is implicitly contained in the latter complete description, it is              
              not at all obvious how to extract it.  The sophisticated                       
              machinery that has been developed by topologists, such as the                  
              surgery groups and algebraic K-theory which are under                          
              investigation in this project, has now been developed to a degree              
              that often permits these natural problems to be handled in a                   
              natural way.
