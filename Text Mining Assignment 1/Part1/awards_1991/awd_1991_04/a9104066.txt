Abstract    :
              With the success of state lottery programs on tribal lands, there              
              is a need to better understand the risk-taking behavior among those            
              who engaged in these gambling activities.  Opponents of gambling               
              argue that the poor and uneducated are the primary players in state            
              lotteries.  But recent literature does not support this claim.  One            
              study defined three distinct segments in state lottery programs:               
              non-purchasers, light purchasers and heavy purchasers.  Heavy                  
              purchasers tended to be middle-aged two-income middle-class                    
              households.  Light purchasers tended to be younger and college-                
              educated.  This research aims to examine who plays what types of               
              lottery games why they play, how often they play and how much they             
              spend on lottery tickets.
