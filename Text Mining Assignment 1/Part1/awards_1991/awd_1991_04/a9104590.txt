Abstract    :
                   Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician carbonate rocks of                    
              southern Missouri host the major Mississippi Valley-type (MVT)                 
              mineral deposits of the region.  Additionally, they are the                    
              principal fresh water aquifers for the area.  This study will                  
              investigate: 1) petrology (including porosity and permeability) and            
              2) geochemistry of these units.  This information will be used to              
              interpret the diagenetic history of the region, particularly with              
              regard to regional basin fluid migration that resulted in MVT ore              
              deposits.  The study will also evaluate the volume of late                     
              diagenetic cements, related to regional mineralization, and                    
              estimate porosities and permeabilities prior to the onset of                   
              regional mineralization and at various stages during mineralization            
              in southern Missouri.  This information will be valuable for                   
              modeling basinal fluid flow on the midcontinent during late                    
              Paleozoic mineralization, gaining a better understanding of the                
              present day aquifers, and will serve as a useful case study for the            
              understanding of late diagenetic alteration of platform carbonates             
              by basinal fluids.
