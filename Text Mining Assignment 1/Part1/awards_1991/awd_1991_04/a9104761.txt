Abstract    :
              The proposed research will define the important cis-acting viral               
              sequences and the trans-acting host (yeast) genes necessary and                
              sufficient for establishing an infection and for in vivo                       
              replication of the L-A and M1 double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses that            
              are components of the Killer virus system of yeast.  The term                  
              "replication" here means dsRNA viral replication, with emphasis of             
              RNA packaging and RNA genome replication.  The specific aims for               
              the research proposed are as follows: 1) Develop and efficient                 
              procedure for the transformation of yeast with RNA.  2) Develop                
              replicon systems for analyzing the molecular details of infection              
              and replication.  The replicons will be single stranded (ss) RNA               
              transcribed in vivo from DNA clones and introduced into yeast by               
              transformation.  The replicon RNAs are subgenomic RNAs which will              
              require viral helper functions in trans to replicate.  3) Compare              
              properties of successful replicons with the properties of natural              
              L-A and M1 viruses; i.e. dsRNA molecules per virus particle;effect             
              pm L-A virus number in wild-type yeast strains and strains carrying            
              superkiller (ski) mutations; compatibility with M1; and host genes             
              required for replication.  4) Identify the 5' and 3' sequence                  
              requirements, and sequence context effect for infection,                       
              replication and translation by manipulating replicon sequences                 
              through in vivo mutagenesis.  5) Identify host genes required for              
              replicon replication by isolating yeast mutants that interfere with            
              replicon replication, and suppressors of those mutants.
