Abstract    :
                   Professor Zhang will study the double cover conjecture                    
              together with related problems.  These include cycle cover                     
              problems and the integer flow problems for families of graphs                  
              containing no subdivisions of the Peterson Graph.                              
                   Graph Theory go back perhaps two hundred years, but only in               
              the last half-century has the field become an active, fertile,                 
              and flourishing branch of mathematics. A graph is a network of                 
              lines ("edges") joining points ("vertices"), thus the language of              
              graphs becomes a natural way of describing interrelationships                  
              among separated objects.  Graph Theory figures most prominently                
              as an essential tool in Communications Theory and Computer                     
              Science.
