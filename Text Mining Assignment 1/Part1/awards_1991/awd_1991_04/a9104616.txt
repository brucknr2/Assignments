Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Tulane University will                        
              purchase workstations which will be dedicated to support research              
              in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for                  
              several research projects, including in particular:                            
                                                                                             
              Research in Computational Biofluiddynamics
