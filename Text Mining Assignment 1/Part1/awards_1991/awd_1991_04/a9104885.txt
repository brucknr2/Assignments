Abstract    :
                   The melting curves of earth materials places important                    
              constraints upon the dynamic state of our planet.  The PI will                 
              accurately measure the melting curves of several geophysically                 
              important materials to 100 GPa.  The experiments will involve the              
              use of a laser heating system (already developed) that is capable              
              of stabilizing and controlling the temperature of the sample to                
              better than one percent.  Past work has indicated the importance               
              of the wavelength dependent emissivity in determining the                      
              temperature using spectral radiometry.  The measurements will                  
              include the measurement of the wavelength dependence of the sample             
              at high temperatures and pressures.
