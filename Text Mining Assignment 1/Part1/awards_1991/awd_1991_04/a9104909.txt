Abstract    :
                   The project involves the development of a new class of metal-             
              cutting fluids with higher thermal capacities than existing fluids.            
              These two-component fluids consist of micron-sized particles of                
              microencapsulated phase-change materials in a standard carrier oil.            
              Phase I efforts showed that some beneficial effects of the two-                
              phase fluid could be demonstrated in cutting tests.  The Phase II              
              effort will expand the development program to allow the formulation            
              of optimal compositions.
