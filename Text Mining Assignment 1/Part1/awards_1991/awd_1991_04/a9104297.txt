Abstract    :
              The proposed project is a direct continuation of studies conducted             
              under NSF project DMB 8715560, building on and exploiting findings             
              in that investigation.  Fumarate reductase from Escherichia coli               
              will be used as a model system for studies on assembly and function            
              of protein prosthetic groups.  This enzyme complex is particularly             
              well suited for these studies in that it is easily genetically                 
              manipulated, the complex is stable and can be amplified to high                
              levels for isolation and analysis, and it is similar in structure              
              and function to succinate dehydrogenase which is a key component               
              of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.  In particular the              
              investigations will provide information on assembly and function               
              of covalently bound flavins, the different iron-sulfur clusters of             
              the enzyme (?2Fe-2S!, ?4Fe-4S!, ?3Fe-4S!) and the sites in the                 
              membrane-intrinsic domain that interact with quinones.  The                    
              approaches of biochemistry, molecular biology, and biophysics will             
              be used to investigate these questions.  Site-directed mutagenesis             
              of specific amino acid residues will be performed and the resulting            
              mutant enzyme complexes analyzed for enzymatic function, and                   
              assembly of iron-sulfur clusters will be monitored by a combination            
              of EPR, magnetic CD, ENDOR, and Mossbauer spectroscopies.  This                
              research will contribute to our understanding of how complex                   
              flavoprotein oxidoreductases assemble into functional membrane                 
              protein complexes and thus help elucidate the path of electron                 
              transport through such proteins.
