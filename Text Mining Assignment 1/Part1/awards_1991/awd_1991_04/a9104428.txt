Abstract    :
                   During the summers, the Aspen Center for Physics will                     
              serve as a meeting ground where theoretical physicists and                     
              astrophysicists can gather to exchange ideas in such areas as                  
              elementary particle physics, condensed matter physics,                         
              astrophysics, and relativity.  This exchange of ideas is                       
              crucial if there is to be vigorous progress in these fields,                   
              and the Aspen Center is exceptionally effective in fostering                   
              this exchange.
