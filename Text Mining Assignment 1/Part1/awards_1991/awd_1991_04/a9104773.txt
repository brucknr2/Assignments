Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              be concerned with the production of the W particle at high-                    
              energy colliders.  Precise calculations of the rate for                        
              production of this particle will be performed.  The particle                   
              is the carrier of the weak nuclear force, and the calculations                 
              to be carried out are important to the testing of our                          
              understanding of this force and of the strong nuclear force.
