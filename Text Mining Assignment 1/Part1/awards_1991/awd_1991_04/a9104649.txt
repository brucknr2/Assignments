Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The formation of new groups is a relatively rare event in                      
              non-human primates.  When it does occur, it may do so either by                
              the division or union pre-existing populations. Once having done               
              so the likely fate of the new groups is unknown as is the                      
              survivorship and reproductive success of its members relative to               
              members of established groups.  Yet, these are important                       
              parameters for understanding the evolution of populations.                     
                                                                                             
              This research will focus on a long-studied, large population of                
              Macaca sinica on the island of Sri Lanka.  The population of 650               
              animals is subdivided into about 25 groups living under natural                
              conditions. All individual animals in the population can be                    
              identified.  Of the groups, 7 have recently formed through                     
              fission and 3 through fusion, thus providing a prime location for              
              determining the fecundity, survivorship and reproductive success               
              of females in stable groups as well as groups formed through both              
              fusion and fission.  Compared to established groups, new ones may              
              face many ecological and social challenges, in particular those                
              which involve competition for limited resources and mates.
