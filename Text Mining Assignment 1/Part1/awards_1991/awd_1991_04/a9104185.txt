Abstract    :
                   Investigations of the mechanical properties of transform plate            
              boundaries have dominantly focused on the crustal (seismogenic)                
              component of the plate.  Although the lithospheric mantle's role               
              in plate boundary deformation has received much less attention, it             
              represents the potentially strongest part of a plate boundary, and             
              thus the region which will control the overall deformation.                    
              Previous studies have also suffered from the application of                    
              rheologic laws which may not be appropriate for the high strain                
              rates and deformation at plate boundaries.  The evolutionary nature            
              of boundaries like the San Andreas has also normally not been                  
              included.  This project will apply current best estimates of mantle            
              rheologic laws to the development of transform plate boundaries and            
              evaluate the 3-D stress, strain, and mineralogic (grain size,                  
              deformation mechanism) evolution of the region.
