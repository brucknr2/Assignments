Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the development, analysis and              
              implementation of a robust, globally convergent, Nonsmooth Equation            
              Based, Successive Quadratic Programming (NE/SQP) method for solving            
              the finite-dimensional variational inequality, nonlinear                       
              complementarily and nonlinear programming problems.  The method is             
              an iterative descent algorithm that is based on a common                       
              reformulation of these three important classes of mathematical                 
              programs as a system of nonsmooth equations, to which an                       
              extension/modification of the classical Gauss-Newton method for                
              smooth equations is applied.                                                   
                   Some preliminary convergence results have been established,               
              and computational experience with previous global non-smooth Newton            
              methods suggests that the new and improved NE/SQP method could                 
              become a major practical tool for solving various kinds of systems             
              engineering and economics equilibrium  problems, as well as for a              
              variety of optimization problems arising from diverse disciplines              
              in science and engineering.
