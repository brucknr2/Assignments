Abstract    :
                   This project will study unique continuation for subelliptic               
              operators, Wiener's criterion and Harnack inequalities, and                    
              symmetry of boundary value problems.  Unique continuation for                  
              subelliptic operators will be studied through a blend of                       
              geometric and variational techniques that allow more cases than                
              the usual Carleman method.  In the studies of symmetries the PI                
              will continue his attempts in the solution to Schiffer's                       
              conjecture and Pompeiu's problem.                                              
                   The questions to be considered in this project are motivated              
              by basic problems in geometry and mathematical physics.  Their                 
              answers will contribute to a firmer understanding of fundamental               
              scientific issues.
