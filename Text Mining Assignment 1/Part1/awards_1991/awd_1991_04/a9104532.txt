Abstract    :
                   This project will develop three topics concerning long time               
              behavior of solutions to partial differential equations.  First a              
              descriptive theory of low dimensional attractors of dissipative                
              forced nonlinear PDEs will be attempted in order to investigate                
              weak turbulence.  This theory exists for the damped and driven                 
              sine-Gordon equation in one dimension; the PI will extend it to                
              the Klein-Gordon equations in higher dimensions and the Ginzburg-              
              Landau equation.  The second topic is the nonexistence of                      
              breather solutions to nonlinear conservative hyperbolic PDEs.                  
              The third topic is the stability of solitary waves for equations               
              describing a bubble cloud and long-wave regularized Boussinesq                 
              equations.                                                                     
                   These problems will be studied numerically and analytically.              
              Their solutions will accrue to our understanding of basic                      
              mathematical and physical issues.  Atmospheric sciences and                    
              hydrodynamics, among others, will be impacted by the results of                
              this project.
