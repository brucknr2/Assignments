Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              As a leaf develops it is converted from a net user of carbohydrate             
              to a net exporter.  This event influences patterns of growth and               
              productivity.  The transfer of sugars form leaf to phloem is called            
              phloem loading.  The accepted model for this process is that                   
              surcose is transferred across cell membranes by selective carriers.            
              An alternative mechanism is proposed in which sucrose passes from              
              cell to cell to the phloem through plasmodesmata, tiny protoplasmic            
              connections that provide cytoplasmic continuity between cells.  In             
              the  phloem, the smaller sucrose molecules are converted to larger             
              sugar molecule that cannot pass back through the plasmodesmata.                
              The sugar is thus trapped in the phloem cells.  The morphology and             
              dimensions of plasmodesmata will be studied along with the enzymes             
              involved in converting sucrose into larger sugars.//
