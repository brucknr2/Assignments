Abstract    :
                This research will study two hypothesis for precursory                       
              information for earthquakes: the first is that patterns of                     
              distributed seismicity can provide precursory information on                   
              major earthquakes such as seismic quiescence, and the second is                
              that dynamical systems models for fault interactions can simulate              
              the precursory statistics associated with earthquakes.  Examples               
              of the latter models are interacting slider-blocks and cellular                
              automata.  This work is based upon a collaborative research                    
              effort between the PI and senior scientists at the International               
              Institute for the Theory of Earthquake Prediction and Theoretical              
              Geophysics in Moscow.  Dr. Andrei Gabielov will spend the                      
              academic year in the U.S. participating in this research.
