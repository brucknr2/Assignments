Abstract    :
                   This project will involve various problems in the calculus                
              of variations related to the existence and regularity of                       
              solutions of differential equations.  The first problem deals                  
              with the equations of uniform rotations of selfgravitating stars.              
              The work builds on recent work by the investigator.  The second                
              problem deals with elliptic equations with critical exponent.                  
              Here relations between solvability and geometry of domains will                
              be studied.  Finally, the regularity of minimizers of degenerate               
              elliptic integrals will be considered.                                         
                   These studies are part of the theoretical basis of                        
              mathematical physics in areas such as celestial mechanics and                  
              material sciences.
