Abstract    :
              Cutin and suberin are the structural polymers of plant cuticle,                
              functioning as protective barriers to the environment and also                 
              among various plant organs.  Although these biopolyesters are                  
              composed of known fatty acid constituents, their insolubility has              
              hampered investigations of how the monomer units are linked                    
              together chemically.  Several new research strategies are                      
              proposed herein:  (1) 13C NMR spectra and spin relaxation studies              
              (cross-polarization and direct acquisition with magic-angle                    
              spinning) of intact cutin to assess cuticular resiliency at                    
              extremes of temperature; (2) 13C and 2H NMR investigations of                  
              molecular interactions in cutin-wax and cutin-water mixtures; (3)              
              production and spectroscopic identification of cutin oligomers                 
              and residues from selective depolymerization treatments; (4) 13C               
              NMR studies of chemical bonding and polymer-polymer interactions               
              in suberin-cell wall assemblies.  With this coordinated approach               
              to supramoleclar structure elucidation in plant cuticle                        
              polyesters, it should be possible to test existing hypotheses and              
              develop new mechanistic ideas regarding their function in crop                 
              protection, plant development, and livestock nutrition.
