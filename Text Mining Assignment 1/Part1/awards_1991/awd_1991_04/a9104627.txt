Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Egypt collaborative research project involving the                   
              University of Pennsylvania and Ain Shams University is in                      
              the general area of electromagnetic phenomena at metal                         
              surfaces.  Project funding will allow the team from Ain                        
              Shams University to work for various periods of time in the                    
              laboratory of Dr. Elias Burstein at the University of                          
              Pennsylvania.  The collaborative research will investigate                     
              experimentally and theoretically the contributions from                        
              surface electronic excitations to the linear and nonlinear                     
              optical response of noble metal surfaces.  Research results                    
              are expected to ascertain the specific nature of the surface                   
              excitations involved.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This project in materials research fulfills the program                        
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Egypt to combine                      
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas                     
              of strong mutual interest and competence.
