Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We shall investigate the effects of surface vibrations and                     
              hydrogen-metal coupling on the quantum tunneling diffusion of                  
              atomic hydrogen and deuterium on nickel and platinum in the temp-              
              erature range 30K to 200K.  We shall also explore the coherence of             
              the tunneling motion through its dependence on adsorbate coverages             
              and surface-impurity concentrations.  A newly developed linear                 
              optical diffraction technique of very large dynamic range will be              
              employed.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The research is intended to advance our understanding of the                   
              physics of surfaces and of quantum-mechanical effects in condensed             
              matter.
