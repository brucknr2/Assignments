Abstract    :
                   Approximately on half of the earth is believed to be MgSiO3-              
              perovskite.  The idealized crystal of this material consists of 8              
              silicon octahedra, each sitting at the corner of a cube with Mg in             
              the center of the cube.  This material, examined at room pressure              
              and temperature is slightly distorted, with small rotations of                 
              these octahedra about various axes to yield an orthorhombic crystal            
              symmetry.  Such distortions in other perovskites, however, have                
              lead to numerous polymorphs with an array of physical properties               
              and temperature dependencies of these properties which drastically             
              differ from those expected in the absence of these rotational                  
              degrees of freedom.  It is the aim of this project to investigate              
              some of these properties with the hope of gaining insight to the               
              behavior of MgSiO3 in the earth's lower mantle.
