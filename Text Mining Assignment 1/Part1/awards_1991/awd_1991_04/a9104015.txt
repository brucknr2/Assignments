Abstract    :
              This research continues earlier work, investigating bilattices in the          
              context of logic programming.  There are two general areas of                  
              exploration involved.  First, develop tableau-based algorithms for             
              linear bilattices, and for more general classes of bilattices, and             
              implement them experimentally.  Along with this goes the investigation         
              of logic programming languages based on these bilattices.  Second,             
              continue the theoretical investigation of bilattices, in particular            
              the development of bilattice-valued modal logics.  Such logices will           
              be much more expressive than conventional modal logics, and more               
              natural for applications.  Experimentation will begin with classical           
              logic then, if successful, will continue to modal logics, and finally          
              to bilattice-valued modal logics.
