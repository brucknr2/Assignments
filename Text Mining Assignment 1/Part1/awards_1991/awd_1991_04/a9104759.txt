Abstract    :
                   There is considerable interest in the geochemistry of aluminum            
              because of the various roles that this major earth element plays               
              in the weathering process, in soil chemistry, and in stream                    
              chemistry.  Gallium is an element with a geochemistry and solution             
              chemistry similar to that of aluminum.  Thus, gallium might serve              
              as an analogue for aluminum.  A consideration of the available                 
              knowledge about gallium suggests that the slight differences                   
              between its chemistry and that of aluminum should lead to                      
              variations in the dissolved gallium/aluminum ratio in rivers.  This            
              variation may provide useful information regarding weathering                  
              processes and aluminum geochemistry.  Limited preliminary data                 
              indicate that variations in the gallium/aluminum ratio do occur.               
              We therefore propose a more thorough preliminary study of the                  
              behavior of gallium in rivers.
