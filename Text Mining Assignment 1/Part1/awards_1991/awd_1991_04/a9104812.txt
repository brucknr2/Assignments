Abstract    :
                   In areas of continental rifting, the flanks of the actively               
              extending areas are commonly topographically elevated.  Flexural               
              rebound of the lithosphere in response to tectonic unloading during            
              extension has been proposed to be the dominant process by which                
              rift flank topography is generated, although other explanations are            
              possible.  This project will attempt to rigorously test this                   
              hypothesis by using gravity data coverage of several large lake                
              systems in the East Africa rift.  Gravity data on land around the              
              lakes is adequate to model the profiles, but data from the lakes               
              are sparse, yet the lakes mark the greatest depressions of the                 
              system.  In cooperation with the Ugandan Department of Geological              
              Survey and Mines and the Zairian University of Lubumbashi, gravity             
              surveys of Lakes Albert, George and Edward will be performed  and              
              resulting data used in detailed three-dimensional models of this               
              area.  Results are expected to determine the role of tectonic                  
              unloading in rift-flank topography development.
