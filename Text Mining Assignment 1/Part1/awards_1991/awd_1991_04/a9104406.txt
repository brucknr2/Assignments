Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on development of a                       
              methodology that can be used for optimizing the freshwater                     
              inflows into bays and estuaries for concurrent, possibly                       
              conflicting purposes.  The objective is a mathematical                         
              model that can be used to determine the appropriate                            
              balance between freshwater inflow required to maintain                         
              desired levels of water quality in estuaries needed to                         
              maintain their biological productivity and water needs for                     
              upland agricultural, municipal and industrial purposes.                        
              The research to find a general optimization model involves                     
              incorporation of a hydrodynamic salinity model with                            
              nonlinear statistical regressions of biological                                
              productivity as measured by the fishery harvest from the                       
              estuary, bay or ocean.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project, involving as it does water quality                               
              considerations in estuaries at the ocean/land-surface                          
              drainage interface is jointly supported by the                                 
              Environmental and the Ocean Systems segments of the                            
              Environmental and Ocean Systems Program.  Results are                          
              expected to be useful for engineering design and                               
              management of amounts and quality of water inflows into                        
              bays and estuaries for meeting concurrent and possibly                         
              conflicting requirements such as water supplies for                            
              agriculture, municipal and industrial needs and the need                       
              to maintain the biological productivity of estuarine, bay                      
              and ocean waters.
