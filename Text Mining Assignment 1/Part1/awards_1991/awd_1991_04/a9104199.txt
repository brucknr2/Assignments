Abstract    :
                This research is to utilize the polarization direction of short              
              period P waves to investigate lateral heterogeneities in the                   
              lithosphere.  Recent measurements of the polarization direction                
              have shown that stable results can be obtained with a precision of             
              about 5 degrees, and that these directions are sometimes                       
              systematically different from ray theoretical predictions based on             
              a laterally homogeneous compressional velocity structure.  Lateral             
              heterogeneities mapped by means of the polarization direction                  
              anomalies have the potential to delineate velocity anomalies                   
              associated with active fault zones.  This research is a component              
              of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
