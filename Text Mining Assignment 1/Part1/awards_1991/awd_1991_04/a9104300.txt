Abstract    :
                   Depositional and diagenetic models developed by the PI for                
              cyclic sedimentation in the Midcontinent Pennsylvanian involve                 
              periodic eustatic fluctuations in sea level and the hydrologic                 
              consequences of repeated marine withdrawal and inundation.                     
              Increasingly refined conodont biostratigraphic control has                     
              corrected several miscorrelations of stratigraphic units along                 
              outcrop, and has produced detailed correlations with the cyclic                
              sequences in Texas and Illinois.  NSF funds will support one of 3              
              interactive projects within this research program: detailed study              
              of a biostratigraphically constrained coeval paleosol interval from            
              Texas and Nebraska to the Appalachians, to determine both the                  
              geographic patterns of climate during a sea-level low-stand and the            
              succession of climate changes related to minor sea-level                       
              fluctuations during this time of low stand.  This work is designed             
              to lead to delineation of the geographic and temporal patterns of              
              climate change during lower stands of sea level.
