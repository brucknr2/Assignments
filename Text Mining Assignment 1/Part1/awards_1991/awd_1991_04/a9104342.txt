Abstract    :
              This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant                   
              biology for two years.  The project entitled "Mechanisms of                    
              action of homeotic gene products during floral development                     
              through chimeric plants" is to be carried out in the laboratory                
              of Dr. Elliot Meyerowitz at California Institutes of Technology.               
              The applicant received his Ph.D. training in the area of cell                  
              biology with a focus on the protein import into chloroplasts.  In              
              his postdoctoral training, he plans to study the molecular                     
              biology of flower development using a variety of mutants of                    
              Arabidopsis.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Plant Biology are designed to                  
              increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant                
              biology.
