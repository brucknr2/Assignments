Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two drill cores were successfully recovered from the Neogene of                
              the Great Bahama Banks carbonate platform. Funding is provided                 
              for the analytical work to test the model of sea.level                         
              fluctuations as seen on seismic profiles and examine the record                
              of burial digenesis and chemistry of modern subsurface fluids.                 
              The results of the study will lead to the resolution of important              
              controversy surrounding the behavior of carbonate platforms                    
              during sea.level change.
