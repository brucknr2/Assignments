Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant                   
              biology for two years.  The project entitled "Molecular                        
              mechanisms of anti-microtubule herbicide binding to plant                      
              tubulin" is to be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Louis C.                
              Morejohn at University of Texas, Austin.  This represents a                    
              significant change in the field of research for this Fellow whose              
              Ph.D. training was in chemical synthesis of metal-binding                      
              proteins.  The focus of the postdoctoral project is the role of                
              microtubules in corn and soybean.                                              
                                                                                             
              The postdoctoral fellowships in plant biology are designed to                  
              increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant                
              biology.
