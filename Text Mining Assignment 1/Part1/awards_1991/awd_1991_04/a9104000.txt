              This proposed conference, organized by North Carolina Central                  
              University and Cairo University, is scheduled for 18-20 September              
              1991 in Alexandria, Egypt.  Topics to be covered include the                   
              entire spectrum of nonparametric and order statistics.  This                   
              conference will be a separate and distinct session associated                  
              with the International Statistical Institute general meeting.                  
              This proposal supports the participation of approximately 10 U.S.              
              mathematicians.  Conference participants will present papers that              
              will be compiled and published as a conference volume.                         
                                                                                             
              This conference in nonparametric and order statistics fulfills                 
              the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                     
              enabling leading experts in the United States, Egypt and                       
              elsewhere to combine complementary talents and present research                
              results in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
