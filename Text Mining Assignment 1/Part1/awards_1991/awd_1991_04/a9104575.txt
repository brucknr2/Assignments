Abstract    :
                   This project deals with the complex structural geology of the             
              coastal belt of Maine from New Hampshire to New Brunswick, the                 
              development of a major regional strike-slip fault system and its               
              relationship to possible oblique convergence during the Mid-late               
              Paleozoic.  It focuses on an area containing two large faults                  
              (Norumbega and Nonesuch River faults) and a complex zone linking               
              them.  The work involves detailed structural analysis of these                 
              faults and transition areas and will attempt to determine strain               
              amounts and kinematic mechanisms for fault interaction.  Results               
              are important to the regional tectonic story, including the arrival            
              of exotic terranes, but also is of interest from a microstructural             
              process-related perspective.
