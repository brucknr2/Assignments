Abstract    :
              This project will use field studies to determine the spatial and               
              temporal distribution of Pliocene to Recent basic volcanic rocks               
              in the east-central MVB.  Selected samples will be analyzed for                
              major elements, trace elements, Sr, Nd, Pb, and O isotopic                     
              ratios, in addition to electron microprobe analyses of minerals.               
              Some of the older rocks will be dated K-Ar methods.  This data                 
              will be combined with existing data on basic volcanic rocks in                 
              the MVB to develop and/or test models for the origin of basic                  
              magmas in the MVB by placing constraints on the composition of                 
              materials contributing to the source of these basic magmas.  The               
              project will determine any correlation that exist between the                  
              distribution of the various types of basic volcanic rocks with                 
              crustal structure, age of and depth to the subducted lithosphere,              
              and age of the rocks.  It will also document the occurrence of                 
              various types of basic volcanic rocks that have only recently                  
              been recognized to occur in subduction-related volcanic arcs, and              
              will provide a basis upon which the more common, more                          
              fractionated, and/or more contaminated calc-alkaline rocks can be              
              understood.
