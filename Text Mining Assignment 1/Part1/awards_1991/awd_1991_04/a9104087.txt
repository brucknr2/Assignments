Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this proposal is to investigate the function of               
              the paternal contribution to early development of Drosophila                   
              melanogaster. For this, Dr. Schubiger will screen male sterile                 
              mutations for paternal effect mutations that permit normal sperm               
              motility and egg penetration but subsequently disrupt                          
              embryogenesis. In addition to identifying the spectrum of genes                
              which, when mutated, cause paternal effects, he will first                     
              characterize the existing mutation ms(3)K81. By analyzing the                  
              embryonic defects caused by paternal effect mutations, the nature              
              of the mutations and their wild type gene products, he expects to              
              determine the unique role of the paternal nuclear and centrosomal              
              contributions in the Drosophila embryo.
