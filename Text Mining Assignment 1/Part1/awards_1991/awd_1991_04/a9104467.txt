Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Understanding of geographical patterns and processes related              
              to industrial production has been limited to some extent                       
              because the focus of economic geographers has been on the                      
              material production of manufactured goods.  Significant and                    
              rapidly growing sectors of the economy include industries that                 
              produce little tangible output, such as information and other                  
              intangible goods.  Understanding the nature of the industries in               
              these sectors involves consideration of different economic                     
              and spatial factors than those associated with traditional                     
              industries.  This doctoral dissertation project will study the                 
              production process, product characteristics, and the spatial                   
              organization of production in the emerging field of knowledge-                 
              based systems (KBS), which are software systems designed                       
              specifically to encode and apply extensive and highly detailed                 
              factual data and techniques, usually of a scientific or technical              
              nature.  An extensive statistical database of KBS industries,                  
              surveys, and in-depth interviews will be used to increase                      
              understandings of the spatial configuration of KBS development.                
                                                                                             
                   This project will provide valuable information about                      
              knowledge-based systems which soon will dominate computer-                     
              telecommunications industries, and it will add depth to the                    
              understanding of geographers and political economists about                    
              processes of industrial development.  This project also will                   
              provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to              
              continue to develop independent research skills.
