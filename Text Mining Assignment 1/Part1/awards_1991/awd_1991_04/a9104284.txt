Abstract    :
                 Professor Reisler is supported by a grant from the                          
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for a two-part study:                  
              One is the photodissociation dynamics of small polyatomic                      
              molecules with emphasis on the influence of the electronic                     
              structure of the excited state on the dynamics.  The other is                  
              collisional dissociation of highly vibrationally excited                       
              molecules.  The experiments will be done with crossed molecular                
              beams, multiphotoionization detection and photoinitiated                       
              vibrational excitation; product state distributions will be                    
              measured.  The ultimate goal is to achieve better control over                 
              the outcomes of molecular dissociations by selective access to                 
              specific regions of the potential surface.  The immediate goal                 
              is to study the evolution of parent molecule excitation into                   
              product fragment excitations.  The systems to be studied are                   
              cyanogen halides and related molecules.

              The influence of the stretching and bending motions in the                     
              molecule on the final outcome when light causes a molecule to                  
              come apart into fragments will be studied. The questions to be                 
              answered in this study are: What products are formed and how is                
              the energy disposed of among these fragments, that is, what is                 
              the energy distribution into the various forms of internal                     
              energies of the fragments?
