Abstract    :
              Under an SGER award the process of selective transfer in                       
              certain lubricated systems will be studied and its                             
              potential as a general wear reducing mechanism will be                         
              evaluated.  An attempt will be made to replicate results                       
              claimed in the Russian-language literature.  The mechanism                     
              of wear protection by the deposited metal layers will be                       
              studied together with the processes of metal dissolution                       
              and metal deposition in sliding systems.
