Abstract    :
              Dr. Robert Toreki has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                     
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Toreki's doctoral degree was from                
              the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the supervision                
              of Professor Richard Schrock.  Dr. Toreki intends to continue                  
              research at Northwestern University under the sponsorship of                   
              Professor Kenneth Poeppelmeier. Dr. Toreki's postdoctoral                      
              research will train him in a broad range of solids                             
              characterization techniques such as DSC, DTA, TGA, XRD,STEM and                
              TEM. Longer term, he plans to apply organometallic chemistry to                
              the design and synthesis of new solid-state catalysts.                         
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
