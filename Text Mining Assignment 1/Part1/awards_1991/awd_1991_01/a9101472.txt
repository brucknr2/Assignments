Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigators will analyze                  
              four problems involving nonlinear differential and integral                    
              equations.  The first problem is an integro-differential equation              
              that describes the entry of a wedge into a bath of water.  The                 
              second problem involves the use of homotopy methods to study the               
              existence of travelling wave solutions of integral and                         
              differential equations that arise in applications.  The third                  
              problem involves the use of shooting methods to study the                      
              behavior of chaotic orbits.  And finally the fourth problem                    
              concerns finding similarity solutions of some two-dimensional                  
              versions of the Navier-Stokes equations.                                       
                   Many of the mathematical models that describe the behavior                
              of everyday phenomena involve integral equations or differential               
              equations or combinations of these two types of equations.  Very               
              often it is easiest to study the solutions of such equations                   
              qualitatively, that is, instead of looking for exact analytical                
              or numerical solutions that can be quite complicated, one looks                
              for approximate representations of the solutions that contain,                 
              more or less, the essence of the exact solution.  In this project              
              the principal investigators will use qualitative methods to study              
              the solutions of integral and differential equations that arise                
              in fluid dynamics, biology and mechanics.
