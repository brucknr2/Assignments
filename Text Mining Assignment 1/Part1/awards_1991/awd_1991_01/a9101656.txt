Abstract    :
              CAD design tools, produced in research projects at the University              
              of Pittsburgh are being developed and enhanced so as to bring them             
              into a state for distribution to general users.  These tools are               
              designed to help researchers and educators investigate synthesis               
              of VLSI systems from VHDL descriptions.  Specific tools being                  
              enhanced are:  1) "Vcomp" a compiler for a subset of the VHDL                  
              language, 2) "Vsim" the corresponding simulator, 3) A companion                
              schematic editor written for X11, 4) A companion netlist-to-                   
              schematic tool written for X11, 5) "VF2VHDL" a reverse translator              
              from netlists to VHDL.  Tasks include:  1) Generate documentation              
              for the compiler and simulator with tutorials, examples, and                   
              classroom aides;  2) Enhance the simulator to provide a graphical              
              waveform display package based on IRSIM/Analyzer from Stanford;                
              3) Convert the old schematic tool from sunview to X11;  4) Clean               
              up for distribution the netlist to schematic tool for X11;  5)                 
              Update the netlist to VHDL tool.  Technical support via email will             
              be provided.                                                                   
                     This grant is made under the Software Capitalization Program.
