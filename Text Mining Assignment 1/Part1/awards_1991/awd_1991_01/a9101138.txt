Abstract    :
              This program at Colorado State University has a REU site focussed around       
              the CSU-CHILL radar facility.  The CSU-CHILL radar facility is an              
              advanced 10 cm wavelength polarimetric Doppler radar designed for remote       
              sensing.  This provides summer employment for students following the           
              junior year.  This is followed by a six credit design project that             
              enables these students to continue working with the radar and to               
              formulate topics depending on their interests.  At the end of the              
              project, students are required to write a formal report and present            
              their results in a seminar series.  The participation of several faculty       
              and the CSU-CHILL staff enables the students to acquire a strong               
              theoretical background while participating in team-oriented or                 
              individual radar related projects.
