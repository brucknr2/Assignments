Abstract    :
                   This proposal is to develop a new type of Fabry-Perot                     
              interferometer based on an existing instruments, but modified to               
              provide greatly enhanced sensitivity.  The new technique called                
              the Circle to LIne Interferometer Optical System (CLIO)                        
              developed at the University of Michigan permits the use of                     
              conventional Charge Coupled Device (CCD) solid state detectors                 
              without the read noise penalty that has impeded their use.  The                
              CLIO technique provides a large advantage in quantum efficiency                
              and offers the opportunity to operate the interferometers with                 
              multiple orders, both of which enhance instrument sensitivity.                 
              It is anticipated that after development of this instrument at                 
              the University of Michigan, the technology would be used to study              
              the dynamic nature of small scale waves in the Mesosphere.  This               
              technology would also be transferred to other CEDAR ground based               
              facilities to improve the sensitivity of the global                            
              interferometer network.
