Abstract    :
              This project consists of a set of studies addressing the issue                 
              of acidity in zeolites and related materials.  Intermediates                   
              in                                                                             
              H-ZSM-5 are studied spectroscopically - nuclear magnetic                       
              resonance being the prime tool - to characterize species whose                 
              stoichiometry and reactivity have been established separately;                 
              the objectives are the determination of the structure of the                   
              intermediates, the nature of their interactions with the                       
              zeolite lattice, and the barrier heights for them to undergo                   
              further transformations.  The effect of various dealumination                  
              procedures and the roles of framework and nonframework                         
              aluminum concentrations are examined by preparation of and                     
              investigation of the acidity of a series of well-characterized                 
              H-Y zeolites; acidity surrogates used include temperature-                     
              programmed desorption and thermal gravimetric analysis of                      
              amines, alkane cracking, and alkali-metal poisoning.  A series                 
              of metal-substituted ZSM-5 and ALPO-5 molecular series are                     
              prepared and examined to determine the relative acid strengths                 
              of these materials and to determine the necessary conditions                   
              for maintaining the metal ions in the framework.                               
                                                                                             
              Zeolites are already widely used in the petroleum and                          
              chemicals industries both as catalysts and separations media.                  
              Despite this, factors influencing their performance are poorly                 
              understood.  This work promises an approach to more rational                   
              design for applications of zeolites and related framework                      
              materials, better quality control over synthetic zeolites, and                 
              possible new applications of known or new framework materials                  
              in chemical processing, environmental control, and other                       
              areas.
