Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An interdisciplinary study of gas-hydrate zone on the Carolina                 
              Continental Rise will be undertaken through two cruises to resolve             
              the acoustic properties and structure of hydrated sediments and the            
              low-velocity zone below and the effect of hydrate formation on                 
              pore-water chemistry and circulation through the rise.  High                   
              resolution seismic reflection profiling through ocean bottom                   
              seismometer survey and coring coupled with heat flow measurements              
              are planned on separate cruises.  This is a collaborative project              
              between University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and Woods Hole               
              Oceanographic Institution.
