Abstract    :
              This project evaluates the long-term social impacts of the Exxon               
              Valdez oil spill on natural-resource reliant communities in Prince             
              William Sound, Alaska. The effects of technological disasters on               
              communities are reflected by changes in perceptions, actions and               
              choices which can lead to long-term social changes. These effects              
              are termed "secondary disasters" and are rarely studied. This                  
              project, unlike the bulk of previous research relating to the oil              
              spill, will focus on the Native and non-Native communities in the              
              region. The study is highly relevant to the well-being of local                
              people and of considerable scientific interest and importance, both            
              inside and outside of the Arctic. The impact of industrial                     
              disasters is, nevertheless, greatly magnified in Arctic and                    
              Subarctic regions because of the sensitivity of the environment and            
              the vulnerability of small natural resource-dependent communities.
