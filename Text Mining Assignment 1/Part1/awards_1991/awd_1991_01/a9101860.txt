Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     This project will determine the early Holocene history of              
              the proglacial lakes in the Great Lake basin to determine their                
              effect on the regional climate. The age, isotopic, lake.level and              
              pollen assemblage information will strongly constrain the timing               
              and magnitude of the isotopic signals caused by Laurentide                     
              meltwaters in the North Atlantic and in particular should                      
              contribute to restricting the various hypotheses of Younger Dryas              
              cooling.
