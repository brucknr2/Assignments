Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Conservation is only a nascent concern in regions with small              
              populations and minimal economic development.  Studies of                      
              emerging conservation movements in these regions have not                      
              determined whether these movements have indigenous roots or                    
              whether they are responses to outside stimulation.  Little also                
              is known about the ways traditional values and attitudes                       
              contribute to their establishment, growth, and form.  This                     
              doctoral dissertation project will study a fledgling conservation              
              movement in Quintana Roo, Mexico, which until about thirty years               
              ago was a virtually undeveloped territory of low population                    
              density and rich natural diversity.  Participant observation,                  
              interviews, and histories of conservation groups will be used to               
              illuminate the nature of local conservation activities that have               
              been carried out in the wake of rapidly increasing tourism,                    
              agricultural activity, and immigration in the state.                           
                                                                                             
                   This project will provide valuable information about the                  
              origins, progress, and factors that shape conservation movements,              
              and it could shed light on the changing roles of humans as                     
              protectors and manipulators of their environments.  This project               
              also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young               
              scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
