Abstract    :
              This project aims at the synthesis of structurally stereochemically            
              and topologically well-characterized vinyl polymers using                      
              principally anionic polymerization.  The synthesis of stereoregular            
              polymers involves the use of Lewis acid type and other additives               
              such as aluminum alkyls, lithium alkoxides and cuprates that show              
              promise in the stereoregulation process.  They will also explore               
              the polymerization of sterically hindered monomers with the aim of             
              a better understanding of the role of monomer conformation and                 
              carbanion geometry in the stereoregulation process.  They also                 
              anticipate that polymers of this type will exhibit interesting                 
              conformational properties including helicity.                                  
                                                                                             
              The second part of this research deals with the synthesis of                   
              macrocyclic homo- and block copolymers including well-characterized            
              macrocyclic polystyrene using capping methods designed to minimize             
              side reactions occurring at extremely low carbanion concentrations.            
                                                                                             
              These macrocyclic polymers will be characterized by several methods            
              including:  1H and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and the                
              corresponding T1 relaxation measurements, Size Exclusion                       
              Chromatography (SEC), viscometry, and light scattering.                        
              Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements are of special            
              interest since they have shown that the molecular weight vs glass-             
              transition temperature profiles are completely different for linear            
              and cyclic poly(2-vinylpyridines).  Collaborative efforts with                 
              several investigators will center on structure-property                        
              relationships for physical properties such as melt viscosity and               
              electron microscopy.
