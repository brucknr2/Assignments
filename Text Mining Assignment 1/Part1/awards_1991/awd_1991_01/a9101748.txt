Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The relative motion between the Cocos, Nazca and Pacific plates                
              will be determined in a kinematic study that extends recent work on            
              the confidence intervals of finite rotations to encompass                      
              confidence intervals on the six parameters necessary to describe               
              finite rotations of a three-plate circuit.  The determined                     
              spreading rates (with vigorous error bars) should offer an                     
              improvement over existing calibrations of the young end of the                 
              magnetic reversal time scale.
