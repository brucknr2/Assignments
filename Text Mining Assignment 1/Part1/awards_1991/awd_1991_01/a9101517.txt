Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the study of Poisson-Vlasov                
              and Maxwell-Vlasov systems which model the time evolution of a                 
              collisionless plasma moving under the influence of its self                    
              inducted electromagnetic field.  Main emphasis will be placed on               
              proving the existence of global smooth solutions and time                      
              asymptotics in the context of modeling solar winds.  A procedure               
              for construction of multiple steady state solutions will  be                   
              further analyzed.                                                              
                   This project has implications in atmospheric sciences as                  
              well as areas of energy such as nuclear fusion.
