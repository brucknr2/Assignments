Abstract    :
              This award will allow continuation of a scientific collabo-                    
              ration between the Biochemistry Departments of the University                  
              of Maryland at Baltimore and the Federal University of Rio de                  
              Janeiro.  The investigators are Guiseppi Inesi (U.S.) and                      
              Leopoldo deMeis (Brazil).  The research is aimed at a                          
              clarification of the mechanism of ATP dependent calcium                        
              transport across biological membranes.  The experimental                       
              system will consist of membrane vesicles derived from                          
              sarcoplasmic reticulum, and obtained by homogenization and                     
              differential centrifugation of muscle tissue.  CA2+ -ATPase                    
              expressed in transfected cell cultures will be also used.                      
              The chemical derivatization experiments will be complemented                   
              by expression of mutated cDNA in cell cultures.  Microsomes                    
              prepared from transfected cells display a very active                          
              transport activity, and constitute a highly favorable system                   
              for studies of specific mutations.                                             
                                                                                             
              The collaborators have a long standing record of productive                    
              collaboration.  The biological significance of this research                   
              is related to control of contractile activation and relaxation                 
              in muscle fibers.  Its chemical significance is related to                     
              enzyme kinetics and catalysis, coupling of catalytic and                       
              transport activities, channels and transmembrane fluxes of                     
              electrolytes, and structure of proteins.
