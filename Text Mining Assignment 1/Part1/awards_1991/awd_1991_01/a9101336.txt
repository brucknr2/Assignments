Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program supports a joint project by Dr. Gregory J. Grant of the                
              Chemistry Department, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga                   
              and Dr. William Setzer of the Chemistry Department, University                 
              of Alabama at Huntsville.  New medium-sized cyclic tridentate                  
              and macrocyclic hexadentate polythioethers will be prepared and                
              used to bind a variety of divalent and trivalent metal ions,                   
              including Pt(II), Pd(II), Hg(II), Cd(II), Re(III), V(II),                      
              Cr(II), and divalent lanthanides.  Organometallic compounds of                 
              Rh will be synthesized and tested as stereospecific                            
              hydrogenation catalysts.  The compounds are expected to exhibit                
              unusual properties due to imposed structural constraints and to                
              display differential affinities for metal ions.                                
              %%%                                                                            
              Large cyclic organic molecules containing sulfur can bind to                   
              metal ions via the sulfur atoms.  When, as in the molecules                    
              chosen for this study, three or six sulfur atoms are available                 
              for such bonding, the metal can be trapped inside a large                      
              organic structure.  Depending on the size of the ring, the                     
              number and orientation of the sulfur atoms, and the properties                 
              of a particular metal ion,  metal ions differ in their tendancy                
              to remain trapped in these molecules.  This research will                      
              prepare new cyclic compounds and examine the properties of the                 
              metal complexes they form.  The project is potentially                         
              important to developing methods of heavy metal extraction,                     
              bioinorganic chemistry, and catalysis.
