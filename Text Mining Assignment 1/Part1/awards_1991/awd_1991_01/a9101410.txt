Abstract    :
                   The Center for Analysis of Structures and Interfaces                      
              (CASI), a Minority Research Center of Excellence (MRCE) at                     
              City College of The City University of New York, proposes to                   
              increase the number of minority undergraduate students                         
              receiving research training and exposure in its focus areas of                 
              research.  Avenues for enhancement of undergraduate                            
              participation include (1):  placement in associate laboratories                
              with research activities close to that conducted by CASI.  In                  
              these laboratories, as well as CASI laboratories, undergraduate                
              students will be provided stipends and a modest supply budget;                 
              (2) development of a summer enrichment program for entering                    
              freshmen to promote successful launching of their college                      
              lives, thus aiding retention.  The summer enrichment program                   
              would have a component activity aimed at aiding students to                    
              assess career goals, and would provide a modest stipend to                     
              participants.  For graduate student participation, the Center                  
              proposes to increase the number of minority Ph.D. students it                  
              supports by six (for a total of eight) to allow CASI to match                  
              support with the actual number of minority graduate students                   
              presently involved in its laboratories.
