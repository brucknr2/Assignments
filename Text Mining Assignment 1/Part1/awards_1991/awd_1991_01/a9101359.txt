Abstract    :
              This research project is concerned with algorithms for minimizing              
              smooth nonlinear functions of many variables.  The research has both           
              practical and theoretical components, and its ultimate goal is the             
              development of new general-purpose software.  The project has three            
              components.  (1) The incorporation of variable metric information in           
              algorithms for large constrained problems will be considered.  The             
              initial effort will concentrate on the use of limited memory methods           
              for bound constrained problems, but novel techniques useful for more           
              general constraints will also be developed.  (2) A complete                    
              convergence theory for nonlinear conjugate gradient methods will be            
              derived.  The new results will fill important gaps in our present              
              understanding of nonlinear gradient methods.  The new methods                  
              suggested by the theory will be tested on large scale problems, in             
              particular, in the variational assimilation of metereological data.            
              (3) New full-rank automatic scaling techniques for optimization                
              methods will be developed.  The idea is to scale the columns of a              
              factorization of the Hessian approximation.  The scaling techniques            
              will result in dramatic improvement in the performance of quasi-               
              Newton methods, especially for ill-conditions problems.
