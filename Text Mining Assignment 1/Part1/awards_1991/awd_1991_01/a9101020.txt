Abstract    :
              This award supports a collaborative program in the                             
              organic chemistry of magnetic semiconductors between                           
              the research groups of Fernando Galembeck (Campinas,                           
              Sao Paulo, Brazil) and Janos H. Fendler (Syracuse,                             
              New York).  Nanosized magnetic and magnetic-                                   
              semiconductor particles will be prepared by                                    
              methodologies developed by the Brazilian group and                             
              will be incorporated into bilayer lipid membranes                              
              and Langmuir-Blodgett films currently in use in the                            
              U.S. group.  They will be characterized by                                     
              absorption spectrophotometry, scanning tunneling                               
              microscopy, and by measuring electrochemical,                                  
              electro-optical, and magneto-optical properties in                             
              the U.S. scientist's laboratory.  Important and                                
              complementary characterization by transmission                                 
              electron microscopy, Mossbauer and ferromagnetic                               
              resonance spectroscopy will be carried out in the                              
              Brazilian laboratories.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The research will result in the development of                                 
              novel, nanosized magnetic and magnetic-semiconductor                           
              particles which will have potentially important                                
              applications as electro-optical, magneto-optical,                              
              and magnetoelectro-optical devices.  The relevance                             
              of the proposed research to high-technology                                    
              applications will serve to motivate students, whose                            
              training will be an integral component of the                                  
              cooperation.  Brazilian students will work in                                  
              Syracuse and U.S. students will do likewise in                                 
              Brazil.
