Abstract    :
              In this project, the P.I. will continue his pioneering studies of              
              ocean circulation and heat transport, concentrating on extending               
              his North Pacific analysis to include nutrient transport across 24             
              degrees N, analyzing a Fine Resolution Antarctic Model output to               
              determine effects of eddies on the Antarctic Circumpolar Current,              
              and using recent high-quality hydrographic sections across 12                  
              degrees S and 23 degrees S to begin some new studies of meridional             
              circulation and heat transport in the South Atlantic.
