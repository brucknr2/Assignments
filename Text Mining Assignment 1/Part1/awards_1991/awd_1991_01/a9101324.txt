Abstract    :
                   This project will study properties of the level sets of                   
              solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations, regularity              
              of weak solutions to Monge-Ampere equations, and probabilistic                 
              perturbations of free boundary value problems.  The principal                  
              investigator has preliminary results in all areas to be studied.               
              The techniques to be used borrow, in particular, from techniques               
              developed by the PI in the study of variational inequalities and               
              general regularity theory.                                                     
                   The problems to be studied are the next frontier in partial               
              differential equations; they are motivated by problems in areas                
              as diverse as combustion theory and elasticity.
