Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Submarine springs and seeps discharge a substantial but not                    
              precisely defined quantity of water into the ocean.  Recent                    
              estimates suggest that the magnitude of this discharge, driven                 
              by gravitational and convective forces, may be globally                        
              significant.  Discharged fluids may consist of fresh water,                    
              connate waters, brines derived from evaporite deposits, or                     
              recirculated seawater.  Because the composition of submarine                   
              hydrologic discharge may be markedly different than seawater,                  
              this process is capable of contributing significantly to the                   
              marine geochemical cycling of many elements.                                   
                                                                                             
              The proposed research will determine the potential of using                    
              water column standing crops of the tracers 222Rn, 226Ra and                    
              CH4, constituents greatly enriched in groundwater relative to                  
              seawater, for the purpose of locating and assessing submarine                  
              groundwater discharge to the ocean.  A detailed geochemical                    
              mass balance will be constructed for the single best tracer,                   
              222Rn, within a relatively small area on the continental shelf                 
              of northwest Florida, an area where we expect to find                          
              appreciable submarine discharge.  Groundwater tracer                           
              concentrations and fluxes will be measured, both in the form of                
              discrete springs and as disseminated seeps.  Benthic fluxes and                
              other processes, such as advection and air-sea exchange, which                 
              contribute to changes in the water column standing crop will be                
              evaluated.  These measurements will be modeled to evaluate the                 
              prospects of developing a simple tracer-based technique for                    
              determining the magnitude of groundwater discharge to the ocean                
              applicable to other areas.
