Abstract    :
              The Department of Mechanical Engineering at Clemson is enhancing               
              its established undergraduate research program through this summer             
              component.  The REU site involve students from Clemson and other               
              institutions in a ten week program of research, seminars, and                  
              workshops.  All of the activities challenge the participants                   
              intellectually and develop their critical thinking skills as well              
              as their ability to work independently.  The one-on-one contact                
              with faculty and interaction with graduate students also introduce             
              these students to the opportunities in graduate education and the              
              career options in research and academia.  The Department of                    
              Mechanical Engineering has demonstrated its interest in                        
              undergraduate research through the established Senior Departmental             
              Honors program.  This program includes a research component and the            
              writing of a senior thesis.  Fifty percent of the faculty of the               
              department have participated in this program which spans the areas             
              of thermal and fluid science, mechanical and manufacturing systems,            
              engineering mechanics, and materials.  The summer program                      
              complements this existing program and provides opportunities for               
              a more diverse group of students.
