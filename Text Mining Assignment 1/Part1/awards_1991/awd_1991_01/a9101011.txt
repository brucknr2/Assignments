Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a dissertation improvement award.                                      
                                                                                             
              Demography, a discipline founded in 1878, studies the relation                 
              between population and social structures and culture.  This                    
              project relates the historical development of demography to                    
              cultural and political values of the time, especially to social                
              policies promoting lower birth rates.  The study focuses on                    
              individuals involved in establishing demography, and on political              
              tracts and other literature reflecting concerns with birth rates.
