Abstract    :
              Dr. Vincent Catalano has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                  
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Catalano's doctoral degree was                    
              from the University of California at Davis under the                           
              supervision of Professor Alan Balch. Dr. Catalano intends to                   
              continue research at the California Institute of Technology                    
              under the sponsorship of Professor Harry Gray. Dr. Catalano's                  
              area of postdoctoral research will be inorganic photochemistry.                
              Longer term, he plans to study the ground state and excited                    
              state chemistry of quadruply bonded mixed metal dimers directed                
              towards catalytic or photocatalytic systems.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships Program is viewed as an important                 
              infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and                  
              experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful                      
              careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
