Abstract    :
              Long & Medium-Term Research:  High Resolution Doppler Lidar                    
              System for Ground Base Wind Measurement of Middle Atmosphere                   
                                                                                             
              This award is under the Program for Long-& Medium Term                         
              Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence, which enables U.S.                  
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve months of                  
              research abroad at research centers of proven excellence.                      
              The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,                 
              and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise                   
              and experimental conditions abroad.                                            
                                                                                             
              This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research                   
              visit by Dr. Bruno Nardi of the University of Michigan Ann                     
              Arbor with Dr. Marie-Lise Chanin at the Service d'Aronomie                    
              of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.  The                      
              researchers will build an operational Doppler lidar system                     
              to measure wind in the 10-60 km altitude range of the middle                   
              atmosphere.  This new French technique is the only ground-                     
              based method of obtaining continuous wind measurements in the                  
              middle atmosphere with very high spatial and temporal                          
              resolution.  Wind measurements are necessary to understand                     
              the dynamics of this poorly monitored atmospheric region and                   
              its dynamic coupling to adjoining atmospheric regions.                         
              Besides participating in the construction of this instrument,                  
              Dr. Nardi will help develop and implement analysis techniques,                 
              and participate in a collaborative American-French effort to                   
              validate the High Resolution Doppler Interferometer ?HRDI!,                    
              now in the final stages of preparation at the Space Physics                    
              Research Laboratory at the University of Michigan, to be                       
              deployed in the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite ?UARS!.                    
                                                                                             
              The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                 
              travel and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the                     
              U.S. home institution.
