Abstract    :
              This applicant proposes to study the molecular genetics basis for              
              differences in alcohol dehydrogenase expression among three                    
              species of Drosophila.  Specifically, the study is hoped to shed               
              some light on the importance of structural versus regulatory                   
              genetic variants in adaptive evolution.  The work is planned to                
              take place in the laboratory of Dr. Cathy Laurie at Duke                       
              University.
