Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professors David Kazhdan              
              and Benedict Gross as principal investigators and Dr. Boas Erez as             
              a post-doctoral associate.  Professor Kazhdan will work on tensor              
              categories, the representation of quantum groups and the theory of             
              integration over supermanifolds.  Professor Gross will study                   
              Euclidean lattices constructed from group representations and                  
              triple product l-functions.  Dr. Erez will study problems in Galois            
              module theory.                                                                 
                   This is research in the field of number theory broadly                    
              conceived.  Number theory starts with the whole numbers and                    
              questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another.             
              It is among the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally             
              pursued for purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last                
              half century, it has become an essential tool in developing new                
              algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes for             
              electronics.  Moreover, techniques developed for their applications            
              to problems in number theory have become useful for theoretical                
              physics - as in the proposed research in quantum groups and                    
              infinite dimensional representation theory of Professor Kazhdan                
              supported by this grant.
