Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Novel applications of thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers                 
              (TLCP) are currently prevented by the lack of understanding of the             
              structure formation processes in the liquid crystalline state and              
              during solidification (transition to the crystal state).  Such                 
              understanding is required for controlling mechanical, electrical,              
              and optical properties which not only depend on the intrinsic                  
              molecular properties but also on the large-scale texture.  This                
              research involves a cooperative study of the structuring of TLCPs              
              in rheological and magnetic fields.  Light scattering and                      
              microscopy (R.S. Stein) and rheology (H.H. Winter) will be applied             
              to specifically synthesized samples (Polaroid) and the magnetic                
              field of a laboratory will be utilized to create the necessary                 
              alignment.  Intermediate textural states will be produced by                   
              applying well-defined mechanical and electrical fields.  The study             
              of the field induced monodomain will give the intrinsic properties             
              (Miesowicz viscosities, Frank elastic constants) which are needed              
              to understand the behavior of polydomains.  The natural polydomain             
              and intermediate disclination densities will be studied to lay the             
              foundation for practical applications (design of suitable                      
              processing equipment) as well as for a theoretical description of              
              polydomain TLCPs.
