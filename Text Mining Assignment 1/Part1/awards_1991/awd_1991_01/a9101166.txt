Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The evolutionary causes of genetic differentiation in natural                  
              plant populations are poorly understood.  Estimates of gene flow               
              are necessary to distinguish the relative roles of selection and               
              random genetic drift in producing population structure.  The                   
              purpose of the proposed research is to estimate the contributions              
              of gene flow, the mating system and selection to population                    
              genetic differentiation in the marine angiosperm, Zostera marina               
              L (eelgrass).  Preliminary data suggests that eelgrass                         
              populations are genetically differentiated, despite the potential              
              for long distance dispersal and high turnover rates of                         
              colonization patches in the marine environment.  Estimates of the              
              effective population size, the mating system and the contribution              
              of adult migration to realized gene flow will be incorporated                  
              into existing predictive models of genetic differentiation.  The               
              possibility that genetic drift contributes to observed population              
              structure will be evaluated by 1) estimates of the spatial scale               
              over which gene flow occurs, and 2) transplant experiments                     
              designed to detest spatially varying selection.  Information                   
              gained from this study will be used to evaluate the generality of              
              tends regarding pollination systems, gene flow and population                  
              genetic structure established in terrestrial systems.
