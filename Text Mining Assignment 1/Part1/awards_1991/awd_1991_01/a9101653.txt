Abstract    :
                   Many of the factors that are critical for understanding and               
              predicting weather that is disruptive to human activity occur on               
              what meteorologists term the mesoscale.  Mesoscale phenomena are               
              not well sampled by the operational weather network; therefore,                
              progress is made through episodic field experiments specially                  
              designed to study mesoscale processes.                                         
                   The Principal Investigator has two objectives using data                  
              sets from already completed episodic field programs.  The first                
              is to calculate budgets of water, sensible heat, momentum and                  
              potential vorticity and to examine the magnitudes of                           
              frontogenetical processes in the context of mesoscale convective               
              systems.  This data set is unique in that it allows, for the                   
              first time, all terms in the budget equations to be calculated.                
              A numerical model also will be used to help in interpreting the                
              results.                                                                       
                   The second thrust is a collection of studies aimed at                     
              elucidating the structure and dynamics of mesoscale convective                 
              systems.  These studies include climatologies of radar data over               
              the U.S. and Europe and numerical modeling.
