Abstract    :
              This applicant proposes to study cellular and molecular                        
              mechanisms for memory storage in the brain.  Specifically, the                 
              study is expected to focus on the role of the calcium-calmodulin               
              complex in regulation of the gene expression of proenkephalin and              
              the induction and maintenance of mossy fiber long-term                         
              potentiation.  The work is planned to take place in the                        
              laboratory of Dr. Joe Martinez at the University of California,                
              Berkeley.
