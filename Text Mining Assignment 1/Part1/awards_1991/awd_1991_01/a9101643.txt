Abstract    :
                   Pultrusion, though a well developed processing art, is not                
              well understood scientifically.  Much basic study remains before               
              the process of pultruding composite materials can be stated to be              
              on a firm scientific basis.  Such fundamental understanding will               
              be required to develop high performance structural products or                 
              products that take advantage of the wide range of possible                     
              thermal conductivities of composite materials.                                 
                   These studies will provide a first step toward understanding              
              the pultrusion process variables as they relate to conditions of               
              dynamic loading or to bidirectional thermal conductivity; and,                 
              will result in models to characterize the process and an improved              
              ability to design/produce a pultruded material for a given end                 
              use.                                                                           
                   By focusing research on the effects of process variables on               
              the thermal, dynamic, and non-destructive evaluation (NDE)                     
              characteristics of pultruded polymeric composite products,                     
              innovative material systems can be developed which are important               
              to industry in the United States.
