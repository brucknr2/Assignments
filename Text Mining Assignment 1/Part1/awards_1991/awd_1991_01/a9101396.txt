Abstract    :
              Although its origins are highly abstract, stochastic                           
              approximation is a technique used widely as part of computational              
              algorithms, for example simulated annealing.  This research                    
              addresses at a fundamental level three current difficulties:                   
              failure to converge to a global minimum, random errors that do                 
              not form a martingale, and insufficiently rapid convergence,                   
              i.e., poor approximation for reasonable but finite sample sizes.               
              Progress on each one of these should indicate directions to                    
              pursue in the modification and improvement of current algorithms.
