Abstract    :
              The enzymes used to carry out                                                  
              chemical or biological                                                         
              transformations are often difficult                                            
              to separate from the reaction                                                  
              mixtures in which they are found.                                              
              One-time use of an enzyme, however,                                            
              is expensive.   This has motivated                                             
              a large body of research on enzyme                                             
              immobilization.  The goals of this                                             
              project are to develop a simple                                                
              method to permit repeated use of an                                            
              enzyme along with enhanced enzyme                                              
              stability and, if possible,                                                    
              activity. A new immobilized enzyme                                             
              system is to be developed that will                                            
              convert solid or macromolecular                                                
              substrates, something that many                                                
              other immobilized systems are not                                              
              suited to do.  This will be based                                              
              on conjugating the enzyme (or                                                  
              enzyme complex) to a water-soluble                                             
              polymer that is sensitive to                                                   
              temperature, or in some cases, to                                              
              both temperature and pH.                                                       
              Temperature sensitive polymers                                                 
              exhibit a lower critical solution                                              
              temperature (LCST) when dissolved                                              
              in water.  Such polymers                                                       
              precipitate from solution when the                                             
              temperature is raised above the                                                
              LCST.  This occurs when the polymer                                            
              is conjugated to a protein.  At any                                            
              time during or after the enzymatic                                             
              reaction, the polymer-enzyme                                                   
              complex may be reversibly                                                      
              precipitated from the reaction                                                 
              solution, facilitating product                                                 
              recovery and recycle of the enzyme.
