Abstract    :
              This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science                         
              Program supports collaborative research in theoretical                         
              physics to be conducted by Dr. Richard H. Pratt of the                         
              University of Pittsburgh and Dr.Jose E. Miraglia of                            
              the Instituto de Astronomia y Fisica del Espacio                               
              (IAFE) in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  The focus of the                           
              project will be the study of the theory of emission                            
              of continuum radiation (bremsstrahlung) during                                 
              electron- and ion-atom collisions.                                             
                                                                                             
              The work will probe the relative roles of potential                            
              radiation and polarization radiation mechanisms, and                           
              how they vary with projectile.  The results will help                          
              to identify situations for experimental investigation.                         
              The project allows the collaboration of two                                    
              internationally recognized investigators.
