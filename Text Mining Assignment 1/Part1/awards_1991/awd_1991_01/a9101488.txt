Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with applying modular techniques                
              to the study of P.I. algebras over base fields of arbitrary                    
              characteristic.  The principal investigator will study the                     
              identities of P.I. algebras in the various degrees when the                    
              characteristic of the base field is either zero or positive.  New              
              results and techniques combine these two cases and relate them to              
              a classical problem of Procesi about polynomials over the                      
              integers whose values on generic matrices are divisible by p.                  
              The main tools in this study are combinatorics and group                       
              representation theory.                                                         
                   In this project, the structure theory of algebras that                    
              satisfy polynomial identities will be examined with applications               
              to combinatorics and the representation theory of the symmetric                
              groups and the classical linear groups.  An example of an algebra              
              that satisfies a polynomial identity is given by the ring of                   
              matrices of a given dimension over a field.  Indeed often these                
              algebras can be represented as rings of matrices.  This work has               
              important consequences for several different areas of                          
              mathematics.
