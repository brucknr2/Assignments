Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Even though all aerobic organisms require molecular oxygen for                 
              survival, the release of activated oxygen species resulting both               
              from normal metabolism and environmental pollution can cause                   
              serious damage to the cell.  Enzymes such as the catalases, protect            
              plants from damage and the resulting reduction metabolic                       
              efficiency.  Since metabolic efficiency, particularly in leaves,               
              is a primary determinant of plant productivity, these enzymes are              
              of significant agrononic as well as scientific importance.  The                
              ultimate objective of this research is to understand the roles of              
              the various catalases in both normal and stress-related metabolism.            
                                                                                             
              CAT3 is the most abundantly transcribed catalase gene in maize                 
              leaves, and the unusual timing of its expression implies an                    
              important, specific metabolic function early at night.  The goal               
              of this project is to clarify the metabolic role of this catalase,             
              and identify DNA sequences responsible for its novel light                     
              regulation.  Ultimately this research will allow the manipulation              
              of agronomically important plants to increase their resistance to              
              oxidative stress.
