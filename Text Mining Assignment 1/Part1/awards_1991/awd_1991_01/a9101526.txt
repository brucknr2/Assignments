Abstract    :
                   Professor Trow will conduct research in the area of symbolic              
              dynamics, a branch of dynamical systems.  His research will be                 
              primarily concerned with factor maps between shifts of finite type.            
              These maps are continuous, surjective, shift-commuting maps.  They             
              are the sliding block codes of information theory.  Professor Trow             
              is interested in the question of existence of these maps, and their            
              possible degrees.  These questions are closely related to                      
              topological conjugacy of shifts of finite type, the central problem            
              of symbolic dynamics.                                                          
                   The objects of study in symbolic dynamics are sets (called                
              symbol spaces) whose elements are bi-infinite sequences of symbols,            
              together with a the shift map.  These spaces are natural models for            
              a large class of dynamical systems.  They are of great interest to             
              ergodic theorists and information and coding experts.
