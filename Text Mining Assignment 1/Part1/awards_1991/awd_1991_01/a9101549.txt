Abstract    :
              This School, to be held in The Woodlands, Texas January 6-12,                  
              1991, is the second International School of Astroparticle                      
              Physics.  Hosted by the Houston Advanced Research Center                       
              (HARC), this week-long School will focus on the recent                         
              astroparticle physics developments that have been evolving from                
              the field of high energy physics.  Participation by                            
              approximately 100 students and 20 faculty members is expected.
