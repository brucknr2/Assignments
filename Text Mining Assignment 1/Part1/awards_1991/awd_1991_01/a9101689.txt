              Geological Sample Storage facilities provide important and                     
              esential services to the geological reserch community. The core                
              repository facility at Lamont.Doherty Geological Observatory is                
              being funded to archive cores and other geological rock samples                
              from the seafloor and provide the important services of sample                 
              distribution and related data dissemination to the marine                      
              geological, sedimentological and paleoceanographic communities.
