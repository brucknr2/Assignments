Abstract    :
              This applicant proposes to study the influence of a known somatic              
              gene mutation on gonad development is the nematode C. elegans.                 
              Specifically, the work will focus on a molecular and genetic                   
              analysis of the gon-1 (gonad abnormality) gene, including better               
              mapping of the gene and cloning it.  Examination of the                        
              developmental processes requiring the gene product will be                     
              pursued as well.  This work is planned to take place in the                    
              laboratory of Dr. Jonathan Hodgkin at the Laboratory of Molecular              
              Biology, Medical Research Council, Cambridge, England.
