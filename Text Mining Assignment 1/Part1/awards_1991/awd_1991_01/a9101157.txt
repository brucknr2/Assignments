Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              PI proposes a theory of electronic structures based on new physical            
              interpretation of interacting non-uniform electronic systems.  The             
              new physics introduced is that of associating a force-field with               
              the Fermi-Coulomb hole charge distribution of an electron.  The                
              local potential seen by the electron is then the work done to move             
              an electron against the force-field of the charge distribution.                
              This proposal deals with the further development of these ideas                
              together with application to metallic surfaces.  PI intends to                 
              further strengthen the foundations of this formalism in order to               
              enable meaningful application to even more complex electronic                  
              systems.
