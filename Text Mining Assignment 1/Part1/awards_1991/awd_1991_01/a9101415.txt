Abstract    :
                   This project deals with homotopy theory and its applications              
              to several related areas.  Friedlander works on the homotopy type              
              of certain algebraic varieties, and also studies the representation            
              theory of mod-p Lie algebras and the cohomology of groups of Lie               
              type.  Additionally, he plans to continue his study of algebraic               
              K-theory.  Mahowald works on intrinsic questions in stable and                 
              unstable homotopy theory.  His main emphasis is on periodic                    
              structures in the homotopy groups of spheres.  Priddy studies                  
              relations between modular representation theory and the stable                 
              homotopy type of finite and infinite groups.  The cohomology of                
              groups and stable splittings of classifying spaces are central to              
              his work.                                                                      
                   In short, all three investigators are working with highly                 
              sophisticated algebraic tools for studying geometric structures.               
              On the one hand, they improve our understanding of the tools.  On              
              the other hand, they apply the tools to answer geometric questions             
              about spaces.
