Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with research on algebraic groups.              
              The principal investigator will study the action of a reductive                
              complex algebraic group on complex n-space in an effort to classify            
              those actions which cannot be linearized.  He will also investigate            
              the conjecture that the algebra of differential operators on                   
              quotient spaces of a complex affine variety is finitely generated.             
                   The research supported involves invariant theory and algebraic            
              groups.  In general, invariant theory involves the actions of                  
              linear algebraic groups on manifolds or linear spaces and the                  
              determination of the mathematical invariants of the space under                
              these group actions.
