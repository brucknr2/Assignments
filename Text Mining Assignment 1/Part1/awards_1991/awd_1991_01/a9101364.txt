Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the optical spectroscopy of rare                
              earth ions in solids which exhibit upconversion, namely the process            
              of converting low energy photons into higher energy photons.  These            
              materials are of current interest because of recent developments in            
              upconversion-pumped lasers.  The focus of the work will be on the              
              evaluation of potential new laser systems.  The concentration                  
              dependence of energy transfer upconversion in yttrium aluminum                 
              trioxide doped with erbium ions will be studied by measuring the               
              infrared to visible conversion efficiency.  In addition similar                
              measurements will be performed on yttrium oxide doped with erbium              
              ions.  The latter material has not yet been demonstrated as an                 
              upconversion laser material.  A third material that will be studied            
              is barium-yttrium fluoride doped with erbium ions.
