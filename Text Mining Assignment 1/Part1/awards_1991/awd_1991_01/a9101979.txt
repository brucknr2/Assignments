Abstract    :
                   This project studies whether including population structures              
              can change unstructured models of ecological or epidemiological                
              systems that converge to equilibrium states into models that                   
              undergo damped oscillations.  Mathematically this amounts to                   
              converting systems of ordinary differential equations into                     
              nonlinear partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary               
              conditions and functional terms.  These equations are studied as               
              evolution equations in an appropriate Banach space.  Specific                  
              examples are age-structured models of childhood diseases,                      
              infection-age-structured models of fatal infectious diseases, and              
              size-structured models of waterflea populations (waterfleas are                
              an important laboratory animal).                                               
                   The dynamics of structured populations and the spread of                  
              infectious diseases are more complicated than simple models                    
              predict.  An understanding of the ways oscillations occur in                   
              mathematical models may well be important to public health, by                 
              helping to predict the course of epidemic or endemic                           
              infections.***
