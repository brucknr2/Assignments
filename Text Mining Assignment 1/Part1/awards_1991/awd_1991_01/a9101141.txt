Abstract    :
              This program involves twelve undergraduate students in research in             
              the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics              
              at the University of Cincinnati.  The students are recruited                   
              primarily from other universities in the region and selected for               
              the program on the basis of their academic achievements.  Specific             
              projects are selected from ongoing research in computational fluid             
              mechanics, biomechanics, experimental fluids and propulsion, large             
              space structures, mechanics of materials, rocket engine                        
              diagnostics, and guidance and control.  The participants spend one             
              summer at UC usually between their junior and senior year.                     
              Activities include: participation in the research,  attendance at              
              weekly REU meetings, attendance at local professional meetings, and            
              visits to private and government research facilities.
