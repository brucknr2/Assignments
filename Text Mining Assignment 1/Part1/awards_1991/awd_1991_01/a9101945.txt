Abstract    :
              This applicant proposes to study the impact of race and poverty                
              on access to needed medical care.  More specifically, the study                
              will integrate dissatisfaction with medical care, structural                   
              barriers to medical care, and social roles into a consolidated                 
              research approach to explain race and poverty status differences               
              in access to needed medical care.  The work will be carried out                
              in conjunction with Dr. William Rakowski at Brown University.
