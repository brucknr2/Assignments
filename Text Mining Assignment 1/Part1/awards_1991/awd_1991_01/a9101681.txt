Abstract    :
                 Research directed at structural characterization of tubulin                 
              isotypes (gene products) and isoforms (post-translational variants)            
              will be continued.  The specific objectives will be to: (1),                   
              complete the structural characterization of the neuron-specific                
              class III isotype, with particular attention to the determination              
              of the connectivity of the side chain glutamylation; (2), use                  
              tandem mass spectrometry in conjunction with enzymatic digestion               
              and specific chemical modifications to sequence and characterize               
              post-translational modification, especially polyglutamylation and              
              phosphorylation, of other beta-tubulin isotypes; and (3),                      
              synthesize and determine the applicability of photoaffinity labels             
              of the colchicine class for localization of the binding site on                
              tubulin heterodimer, followed by tandem mass spectrometry                      
              sequencing of the modified tubulin.                                            
                                                                                             
              Microtubules are an extremely important class of cellular                      
              structural proteins (cytoskeleton) which contribute to the                     
              morphological and functional characteristics of the cell: they                 
              comprise the basis for structure and function of flagella and                  
              cilia; they are the key cytoskeletal elements associated with                  
              chromosomal movement and polarity of cellular divisions; they                  
              provide an intracellular scaffolding to maintain cell shape; and               
              since certain intracellular transport phenomena in eukaryotic cells            
              utilize microtubules as the structural track along which transport             
              takes place, they contribute to directional or spatial                         
              organizational aspects of cellular function and subcellular                    
              dynamics.  The long term goal of these studies is to understand the            
              functional significance of the structural variations which are                 
              present in tubulin isoforms and isotypes.
