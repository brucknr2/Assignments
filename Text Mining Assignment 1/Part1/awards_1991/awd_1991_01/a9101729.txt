Abstract    :
                   This research is to develop a new method for the fabrication              
              of plastic optical fibers that is applicable to various polymers               
              including the ones which cannot be made into optical fibers by                 
              the conventional methods despite their excellent optical                       
              properties.  The new method is, in a sense, a modified                         
              coextrusion process in which a thermoplastic material is spun                  
              into a hollow fiber forming a cladding while another material is               
              fed into the core at the same time.  In this process only the                  
              cladding material has to be thermoplastic and the core material                
              can be any class of materials; a liquid, an elastomeric gel, or a              
              thermoplastic.  After the spinning, the core material may be                   
              polymerized or cross-linked to enhance the mechanical strength of              
              the optical fiber.  To assess the effectiveness and the                        
              applicability of the technique, a liquid monomer and a cross-                  
              linkable elastomer are used as the core of the optical fibers.                 
              The core materials are polymerized/cross-linked after the                      
              spinning process, and the quality of the optical fibers are                    
              evaluated.                                                                     
                   The most significant feature of the new technique is its                  
              broad applicability to numerous materials, thus opening the way                
              to explore a variety of core material options for plastic optical              
              fibers which could not be considered before by the conventional                
              methods.
