Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his research in                  
              complex differential geometry and nonlinear analysis. He will be               
              particularly concerned with a study of Kahler manifolds through                
              Kahler-Einstein metrics. In the 1950's Calabi asked if one could               
              find a Kahler-Einstein metric on a compact Kahler manifold with                
              positive first Chern class and no nontrivial holomorphic vector                
              fields. Tian will try to answer this question by obtaining                     
              estimates for the associated Monge-Ampere operator on the                      
              underlying Kahler manifold. The methods involve nonlinear partial              
              differential equations, compactness arguments, and collapsing of               
              Riemannian manifolds.                                                          
                   The existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics on spaces has become             
              an important problem in differential geometry. It is related to the            
              structure of space-time in which the curvature of space-time is                
              proportional to the stress field. Spaces in which curvature is                 
              proportional to distance are called Einstein spaces. The principal             
              investigator will try to determine if a class of spaces with a                 
              "complex" structure can be given the additional Einstein structure.
