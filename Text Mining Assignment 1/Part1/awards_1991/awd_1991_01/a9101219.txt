Abstract    :
              Professor Barry K. Lavine and other members of the Chemistry                   
              Department at Clarkson University are being supported to                       
              conduct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in                
              Chemistry.  During the summer of 1991, eight undergraduate                     
              students will spend eight weeks actively engaged in a variety                  
              of research projects.  Many of the projects are concerned with                 
              colloid chemistry, such as investigation of the stability of                   
              lyophobic colloids or plasma modification of fine particles,                   
              but projects are also available in chromatography,                             
              spectroscopy, and other areas.  During the first week of the                   
              program, students will be introduced to research techniques and                
              instrumentation.  Students will prepare a progress report and a                
              final report on their research and will give an oral                           
              presentation on their results.
