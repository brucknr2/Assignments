Abstract    :
                   This award will support research in three related areas:                  
              topological invariants of non-simply-connected manifolds derived               
              from heat kernels on covering spaces, higher signature extensions              
              of spectral invariants, and Riemannian geometry on noncommutative              
              spaces. The last area is connected with mathematical aspects of                
              particle theory and mathematical physics.                                      
                   The relationship between local information and global                     
              topological information is fairly well understood on compact                   
              surfaces or manifolds. The situation in the noncompact or unbounded            
              case is much more difficult. This research involves trying to                  
              understand this relationship in cases in which the noncompact space            
              is related to a compact space in a precise manner.
