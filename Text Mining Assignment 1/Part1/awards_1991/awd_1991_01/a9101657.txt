Abstract    :
              The overall objective of the research is to understand the                     
              mechanisms of creep and be able to predict the magnitudes and rates            
              of displacements of submarine slopes.  The previous 3-year program             
              provides the geological basis, extensive experimental data base,               
              and foundation of a finite element code for studying creep                     
              processes of slopes.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The laboratory testing will focus on further development of                    
              analytical creep constitutive relationships for sediments found on             
              the continental slope and rise.  The finite element code will be               
              expanded and improved to incorporate a wider range of material                 
              behavior and applied to more complex slope configurations.  In the             
              laboratory physical model portion of the program, in which actual              
              experiments are just beginning, the apparatus will be improved to              
              provide additional monitoring capabilities and more precise                    
              measurements.  The research is scientifically relevant in terms of             
              understanding a broad range of slope processes and has important               
              implications to the sitting of offshore installations on slopes.
