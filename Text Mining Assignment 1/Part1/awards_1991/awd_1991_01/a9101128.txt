Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The ambystomatid salamanders exhibit a striking diversity of                   
              life-history patterns, including species with obligate                         
              metamorphosis, species with obligate paedomorphosis, and still                 
              other species that can pursue either pathway facultatively.  To                
              re-examine two hypotheses, regarding paedomorphosis.  The progeny              
              from interspecific crosses will be analyzed using a combined                   
              genetical and ecological approach.  Hybrid larvae created by                   
              mating Ambystoma mexicanum (an obligate paedomorph) with A.                    
              tigrinum (from an obligately metamorphosing population) will be                
              scored for life-history pathway under various food and                         
              temperature treatments.  The co-segregation of morphological                   
              traits, growth rates, isozymes, and RFLP markers in the second-                
              generation offspring will be examined in an attempt to identify                
              major loci contributing to these developmental characteristics.                
              By combining an ecological perspective and modern molecular tools              
              in a genetical analysis of life history variation, this study                  
              will make fundamental contributions to our knowledge of the                    
              evolutionary mechanisms underlying the present-day diversity of                
              developmental pathways in an important group of vertebrates.
