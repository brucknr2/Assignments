Abstract    :
                   In the last decade, the interaction between gauge theory and              
              geometric topology on 4-manifolds has produced some striking                   
              results.  Among these results is the discovery of nonstandard                  
              smooth structures on real 4-space.  This project investigates three            
              problems related to 4-manifolds:  1) The Donaldson invariants of               
              manifolds; 2) the behavior at infinity of the 'fake' smooth                    
              structures on real 4-space; and 3) the explicit computation of                 
              several of Donaldson's invariants.                                             
                   This project lies at the interface of topology and physics.               
              A 4-manifold may be represented by 3 space coordinates and a time              
              coordinate.  It has recently been proven that the standard                     
              Euclidean smooth structure on 4-space when restricted to certain               
              subsets homeomorphic to 4-space gives a smooth structure which is              
              not diffeomorphic to the standard one.  Thus, there exist exotic 4-            
              dimensional manifolds.  This research concerns the geometric and               
              differential properties of these exotic 4-manifolds.
