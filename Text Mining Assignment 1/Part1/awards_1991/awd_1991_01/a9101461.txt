Abstract    :
              In this project, the P.I. will study the possibility that surface-             
              intensified baroclinic geostrophic jets are the source of                      
              mesoscale (10-100 km) temperature and velocity variability                     
              observed in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Subtropical                   
              Convergence Zones.  A linear instability model will be solved by a             
              method recently introduced for studying atmospheric cyclogenesis.
