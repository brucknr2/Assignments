Abstract    :
                   This project deals with problems of optimal stochastic                    
              control and its applications.  These involve switching systems,                
              ergodic control, and control of distributed parameter systems.                 
              Specifically, the PI's will study the optical control of                       
              switching systems, free boundary problems in several dimensions                
              and the long-time cost criteria in ergodic control problems.                   
                   The applications of such studies include the optimal                      
              scheduling of multiple power generations to meet a random demand               
              for power, the control of  queuing and production systems, and                 
              the control of chemical reactions, space structures, robots, etc.
