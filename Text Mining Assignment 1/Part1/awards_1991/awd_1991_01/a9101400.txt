Abstract    :
                   This project will study H-infinity control theory.  The                   
              topics to be emphasized are linear time-invariant finite-                      
              dimensional plants, Wiener-Hopf factorization and interpolation                
              for rational matrix functions, distributed parameter systems, and              
              H-infinity optimization for nonlinear systems.  Morse theory,                  
              operator and function theory are expected to play a central role.              
                   The problems to be studied are motivated by the need of                   
              controlling engineering systems.  This project includes nonlinear              
              cases where the known theory for a narrow band of frequencies                  
              does not apply.  Computer codes will be developed upon successful              
              understanding of the underlying mathematical theory.
