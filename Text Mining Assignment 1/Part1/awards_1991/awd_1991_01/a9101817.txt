Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the noncommutative                        
              differential geometry of the deformations of commutative                       
              algebras; algebras of differential operators; symbols of                       
              pseudo-differential operators; coordinate algebras of                          
              quantum groups and spaces; and differential operators on                       
              quantum manifolds.  The principal investigator will develop a                  
              Riemann-Roch theorem for quantum manifolds through his work on                 
              the cyclic homology theory of quantum groups and spaces.                       
              Applications of these results to arithmetic and conformal                      
              quantum field theory will also be explored.                                    
                   The research in this project is an outgrowth of calculus                  
              on manifolds.  Roughly speaking, manifolds are surfaces and                    
              their higher-dimensional analogues.  Differential operators,                   
              which come from calculus, see the manifold only in small                       
              pieces, but nevertheless contain information about its overall                 
              shape and conformation. One strategy for extracting this sort                  
              of information from differential operators involves assembling                 
              the operators into algebraic structures and then using                         
              algebraic machinery.  This project is concerned with the                       
              development of this machinery.
