Abstract    :
              This research project is concerned with development and evaluation             
              of algorithms for signal processing and analysis that exploit                  
              higher order statistics of signals in addition to, or in lieu of,              
              the usual second order statistics.  Whereas the second order                   
              statistics of signals are a function of only the underlying system             
              transfer function magnitude, higher order statistics depend upon               
              both the system transfer function magnitude as well as its phase.              
              Both time series (only system output is observed) and system                   
              identification (both input and output are observed) formulations               
              are being considered.  Several aspects of the problem including                
              inverse and direct modeling, deconvolution and parameter                       
              estimation, are being investigated.  Emphasis in this project is               
              on optimization of an appropriately defined fourth cumulant                    
              criterion in conjunction with, or in lieu of, the usual second                 
              order error criterion, thereby obviating the need for explicit data            
              cumulant matching.  Among the applications being investigated are              
              1) time delay estimation in unknown spatially uncorrelated Gaussian            
              noise, 2) blind deconvolution with unknown, possibly nonminimum                
              phase, channels, and 3) system identification with noisy inputs.
