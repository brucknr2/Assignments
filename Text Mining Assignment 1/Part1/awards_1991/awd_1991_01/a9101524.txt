Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop concurrency control               
              algorithms for transactions in distributed database systems which              
              achieve high throughput and low response time.  Data replication is a          
              mechanism that has been proposed for this purpose.  Unfortunately, the         
              requirement that transactions behave serializably                              
              forces considerable synchronization among replica sites and hence              
              adversely impacts throughput and response time.                                
              This work will consider the tradeoff between serializability and               
              throughput/response time by allowing bounded violations of the                 
              database's integrity constraints.  Such violations occur when                  
              conflicting transactions are not synchronized.  Under these                    
              circumstances a transaction is ignorant of the effects of some prior           
              transactions, and so the results it returns and the modifications it           
              makes to the database are based on incomplete information.  Both the           
              deviation from serializable behavior and the throughput/response time          
              are directly related to the extent of ignorance.  Concurrency control          
              algorithms which bound the extent to which a transaction can be                
              ignorant of conflicting transaction will bound the deviation from              
              serializable behavior.  Since violations of integrity constraints are          
              not permissible in all applications, the research involves study of            
              the characteristics of applications in which violations can be                 
              tolerated.
