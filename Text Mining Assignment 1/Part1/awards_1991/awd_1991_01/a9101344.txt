Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor Jacob Leventhal of the                       
              University of Missouri at St. Louis in a research collaboration                
              with Professors M. Allegrini and E. Arimondo of the University                 
              of Pisa, Italy.  The purpose of the collaboration is to study                  
              the interaction of highly excited atoms in order to better                     
              understand atomic properties at the boundary between classical                 
              and quantum mechanics.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The work, which represents a continuation of collaborative                     
              work starting in the early 80's, is producing significant                      
              research in atomic interactions.  The proposed experiments                     
              will combine the infrared expertise of the Italian group with                  
              techniques developed in St. Louis for the production of                        
              highly excited atoms.  Fundamental to the experimental set-up                  
              is the fact that highly excited atoms, by virtue of their                      
              sensitivity and exaggerated responses, provide useful                          
              amplification of atomic properties making it feasible to                       
              study effects that would otherwise be difficult to observe.
