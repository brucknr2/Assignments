Abstract    :
              This proposal involves collaborative research with Chinese                     
              scientists from Jilin University on the saddle point method                    
              and applies the complex coordinate approach to compute                         
              resonance widths in atoms.  Of particular interest are                         
              branching ratios between optical and Auger channels, highly                    
              excited four and five electron systems, core excited Auger                     
              states spin dependent processes and the interpretation of                      
              experimental data of highly states.                                            
                                                                                             
              This project combines the expertise of the Chinese scientist                   
              in multi-channel quantum defect methods with the experience                    
              of Dr. Chung in addressing this useful niche in atomic theory.
