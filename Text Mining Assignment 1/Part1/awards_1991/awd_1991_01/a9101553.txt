Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The study will document the relationship between shell growth,                 
              shell habitat and shell chemistry of deep.living planktonic                    
              formainifera, leading to a clearer understanding of the chemistry              
              of upper 1000 m of sea water and its controls on contained fauna               
              and their use as paleoceanographic indicators. Stable isotop, Mg               
              and Sr studies are planned.
