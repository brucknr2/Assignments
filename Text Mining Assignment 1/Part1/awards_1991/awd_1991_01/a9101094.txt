Abstract    :
              This award provides continuing support to The Institute of                     
              Ecosystem Studies' Research Experiences for Undergraduates (IES-               
              REU) SITE.  The program will immerse students in a highly                      
              interactive, research oriented environment.  The major tenet is                
              that success in science depends on understanding the context of                
              research, as well as the substance and procedures of a particular              
              discipline.  Program goals are:  (1) to provide intensive                      
              training in ecological research; (2) to broaden students'                      
              perspectives on the societal, ethical and theoretical contexts of              
              science; (3) to give students direct exposure to the life of a                 
              research scientist; and (4) to promote an understanding of                     
              ecology.  Eight students will be brought to the Institute for a                
              twelve-week program in each of the next three summers, building                
              upon the strengths of the highly successful 1988-1990 programs.                
              The program will include the following components:  (1) Student                
              Research Projects; (2) Research Strategies for the Undergraduate,              
              a series of intensive training sessions; (3) Research in Context,              
              a seminar series designed to broaden students' perspectives  on                
              the various components and applications of science; (4) Forum on               
              Opportunities in Ecology, a full-day program with representatives              
              from a broad spectrum of ecological and related disciplines; (5)               
              Ecology Seminars; and (6) a variety of other supporting                        
              activities.  Under the guidance of a mentor scientist, each                    
              student will delineate a research question and associated                      
              hypotheses, select appropriate methods, and develop a research                 
              plan.  Students will then implement the project, finishing with                
              analysis and report writing.  Presentations in a formal Research               
              Symposium will conclude the summer program.  Final papers will be              
              collated and published as an IES Occasional Publication.
