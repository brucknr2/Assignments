Abstract    :
              Parallel algorithms will be developed for general nonlinear programs           
              as well as for linear and quadratic programs.  Emphasis will be placed         
              on the recently proposed idea of constraint distribution among                 
              parallel processors as well as inexact and exact matrix splitting              
              methods for the linear complementarity problem.                                
                   Applications of mathematical programming to pattern recognition           
              and neural networks will also be made, where the potential of                  
              optimization algorithms has not been fully realized.  Particular               
              attention will be given to medical diagnostic problems, some of which          
              have been successfully solved by linear programming.                           
                   Mathematical theory that is needed for the above algorithms and           
              applications will be developed and sharpened.  An important and                
              promising area to be focused on is that of error bounds                        
              for various types of mathematical programs.
