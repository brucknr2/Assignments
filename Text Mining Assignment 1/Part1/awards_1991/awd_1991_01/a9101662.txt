Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Study of chemistry and circulation of thermocline waters in                    
              Indonesian Seaway during glacial/interglacial transitions.                     
              isotopic and faunal analyses of high sedimentation rate sequences              
              to decipher the record of past 20 k.y. to determine the timing                 
              and nature of changes in hydrographic patterns. AMS dating on key              
              samples will provide absolute chronology. A small exploratory                  
              award is made to prove the validity of the method.
