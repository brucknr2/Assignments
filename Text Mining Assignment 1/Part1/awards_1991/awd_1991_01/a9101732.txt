Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor Joseph Bronzino of Trinity                   
              College, Connecticut, in a research collaboration with                         
              Professor Pietro deFranciscis of the University of Naples,                     
              Italy.  The aim of the research is to study the development                    
              of neuronal plasticity, including synaptic transmission and                    
              modulation of cell activity in chronically implanted, freely                   
              moving rats.  Results of these studies would add much to our                   
              understanding of a number of developmentally-dependent                         
              hippocampal processes related to learning and memory.                          
                                                                                             
              This award will help to maintain a successful research                         
              collaboration initiated over 10 years ago.  For this research,                 
              the Italian group will collect data from groups of 45 and 90                   
              day-old groups while the U.S. group will do the same for 15                    
              to 30 day groups.  The collaboration will expedite the                         
              exchange of scientific knowledge and will provide students                     
              with an opportunity to engage in an international research                     
              effort.
