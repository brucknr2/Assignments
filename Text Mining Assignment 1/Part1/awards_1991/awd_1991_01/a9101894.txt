Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will aid in purchasing a Quadrupole/Quadrupole (QQ) Option for                 
              the high resolution mass spectrometer in the Department of                     
              Chemistry at the University of Florida.  This option will make                 
              the instrument a hybrid sector instrument of BEQQ geometry by                  
              adding two quadrupoles in series with the sector (BE) portion                  
              of the existing instrument.  The research studies to be                        
              performed include the following:  gas-phase reactions of metal                 
              complexes, electrochemistry and mass spectrometry in the study                 
              of metabolic redox reactions mechanism, synthetic studies of                   
              the ene reaction and SmI2-mediated reactions, kinetic and                      
              stereochemical effects of fluorine substituents in thermal                     
              homolytic and pericyclic reactions, carbene complexes from                     
              rearrangement of transition metal sigma complexes and strained                 
              allenes.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate                   
              structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of                 
              a vast array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic                         
              molecules.  When combined with a quadrupole-quadrupole (QQ)                    
              option, the range of tandem-mass spectrometic analysis is                      
              increased.  It affords the chemist one the most powerful tools                 
              available for the characterization of compounds.  The                          
              acquisition of capability in mass spectrometry is essential for                
              the prosecution of frontier research in many fields of                         
              chemistry.
