Abstract    :
              Interactions between adatoms on metal surfaces will be examined                
              using the field ion microscope to investigate chemical and                     
              structural factors in pair interactions, many-atom interactions and            
              overlayer stability, and interactions and surface diffusion.  The              
              dependence of pair energetics upon the chemical identity of the                
              adatoms will be explored with pairs of palladium and gold atoms on             
              tungsten.  Measurements of cluster dissociation for iridium and                
              palladium on tungsten will be combined with data on pair                       
              interactions to determine the role of many-atom effects in                     
              cohesion.  Diffusion in a surface layer containing many adatoms                
              will be studied by measuring the time correlation of concentration             
              flucturations to establish the effects of interaction on the                   
              diffusivity.
