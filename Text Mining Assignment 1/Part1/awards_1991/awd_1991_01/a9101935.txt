Abstract    :
              Dr. John Porco has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                        
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Porco's doctoral degree was from                 
              Harvard University under the supervision of Professor Stuart                   
              Schreiber. Dr. Porco intends to continue research at the                       
              Research Institute of Scripps Clinic under the sponsorship of                  
              Professor Chi-Huey Wong. Dr. Porco's postdoctoral training will                
              provide him with skills in enzyme manipulation, carbohydrate                   
              synthesis and antibody-antigen recognition. Longer term, he                    
              plans to design and generate catalytic antibodies for                          
              oligosaccharide cleavage.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
