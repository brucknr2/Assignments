Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support continued maintenance and distribution of              
              the protozoa collection housed at the Protistology Department of               
              the American Type Culture Collection.  The current holdings, all               
              maintained in the cryopreserved state, consist of approximately                
              1,000 strains.  NSF support contributes to the free-living                     
              protozoa portion of the Collection.  In 1989, 3,010 protozoa were              
              distributed, of which over 80% of requests came from the U.S.                  
              institutions.  The user's community consists of Universities                   
              (48.7%), High Schools (1.4%), Hospitals (6.4%), For-Profit                     
              Organizations (31.1%), and Government (7.4%).  The NSF support is              
              primarily to provide research resources to the research community              
              of the Biological, Behavioral and Social Sciences Directorate.
