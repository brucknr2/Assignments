Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation project extends and tests theories of moder-                 
              nization.  From four decades of Mexican censuses, measures of                  
              underemployment, poverty, and living conditions are predicted to               
              vary systematically with urbanization and industrial development.              
              Hypotheses include the idea that average physical and human                    
              capital tend to diverge with modernization, and that, under                    
              certain conditions, expanding industrial infrastructure can cause              
              declining economic performance per capita.
