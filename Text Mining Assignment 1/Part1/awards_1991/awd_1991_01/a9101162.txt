Abstract    :
                   Nonlinear dispersive waves form and propagate as packets of               
              rapidly oscillating wavetrains.  Modulation equations which                    
              describe this evolution, for conservative systems with exact                   
              solutions, were first derived, via an averaging method, by Whitham.            
              Lax and Levermore placed this work in an analytically well-posed               
              context by relating it to the zero dispersion limit of KdV.                    
              Recently, interest in dispersive waves has been renewed by the                 
              simultaneous development of many new ideas and methods.                        
                   This grant is to enable some young researchers to attend and              
              participate in a NATO Advanced Research Workshop to be held in                 
              France in July, 1991.  They will have the opportunity to interact              
              with the world's leading researchers in this area as they share                
              their diverse approaches and chart new directions and problems of              
              importance in this subject.
