Abstract    :
              The applicant will study complex systems of symbols.  More                     
              specifically, she will work toward development and validation of               
              a "culturally relevant" mathematical model of generalizable                    
              complex symbolic systems, with outcomes expected to have                       
              implications for education and communication.  Her work will be                
              done under the supervision of Professor Roy G. D'Andrade at the                
              University of California at San Diego.
