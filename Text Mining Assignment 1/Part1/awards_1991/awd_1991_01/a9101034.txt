Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Continued analysis and interpretation of data collected during                 
              South Channel Ocean Productivity Experiment (SCOPEX), an                       
              interdisciplinary experiment focused on the North Atlantic right               
              whales, is proposed.  Also new modeling to examine the effect of               
              stratification on tidal rectification, relevant to SCOPEX, is                  
              requested.  This proposal covers only the physical oceanographic               
              component.
