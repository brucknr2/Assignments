Abstract    :
              This award will support research on dynamic properties of                      
              polymers, including dissipative processes.  The project builds                 
              upon research on the equilibrium properties of ferroelectric                   
              random copolymers, which is currently being funded by NSF.  The                
              U.S. investigator is Philip Taylor of Case Western Reserve                     
              University and the Venezuelan investigator is Rafael Rangel of                 
              the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC).                
                                                                                             
              Dissipative processes involved in equilibrium states are of                    
              increasing importance.  In this project, Taylor's experience                   
              with equilibrium processes, statistical mechanics of chain                     
              molecules, and polymer physics will be combined with Rangel's                  
              experience with dissipative processes, non-equilibrium systems,                
              Ginzburg-Landau theory, and multifractality.  The analytical                   
              work will initially be in Venezuela and the computational work                 
              will be in the United States, where the availability of the                    
              Ohio Supercomputer Center will be advantageous.
