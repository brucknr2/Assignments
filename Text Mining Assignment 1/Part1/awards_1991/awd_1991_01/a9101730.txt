Abstract    :
                   Optimal design determines the experimental conditions for each            
              observation for the most efficient statistical analysis of the                 
              data; and the best choice of design depends upon the kind of                   
              analysis to be done.  This research constructs optimal designs for             
              modern data analytic approaches and also examines the design                   
              problem when certain experimental conditions are already fixed.                
                   A second research component focusses on extending modern data             
              analytic approaches, particularly interaction spline models and                
              wavelet models.
