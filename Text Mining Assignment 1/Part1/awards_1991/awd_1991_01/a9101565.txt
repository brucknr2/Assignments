Abstract    :
                   The promise of high temperature, superconducting ceramic                  
              materials is well known.  However, there are many practical                    
              difficulties involved in fabricating technologically useful                    
              conductors from these materials.  The Phase I effort has                       
              demonstrated the usefulness of a laser-driven solidifaction                    
              process in producing high temperature superconducting wires with               
              a controlled orientation of the ceramic crystals to improve the                
              conducting properties.                                                         
                   The Phase II research objectives include design of a                      
              computer-controlled, laser-driven directional solidification                   
              furnace, determination of the best extrusion parameters for the                
              precursor material, characterization and testing of the wires                  
              which are produced and scale-up of the process.
