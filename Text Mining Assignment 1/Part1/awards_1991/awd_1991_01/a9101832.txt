Abstract    :
                   Professor Lee will study nonlinear partial differential                   
              equations related to problems in geometry. One of the goals will be            
              to find complete Einstein metrics on the ball with prescribed                  
              conformal infinity. A second area of research will be the space of             
              CR structures on a three dimensional manifold. The work on partial             
              differential equations will involve an attempt to extend the idea              
              of the maximum principle to systems. There have been numerous semi-            
              successful attempts at this in the past and any progress made by               
              the principal investigator in this direction should find immediate             
              application.                                                                   
                   This award will support research in the cross disciplinary                
              area of global analysis which studies geometry through partial                 
              differential equations. One of the interesting applications of the             
              research involves the inverse problem of measuring the conductivity            
              properties of a material from electrical measurements made on the              
              boundary of the material. It is possible to reformulate this                   
              problem as one in differential geometry and then uses methods from             
              this well developed field to attempt to answer questions concerning            
              the inverse problem.
