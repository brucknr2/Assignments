Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the representation theory                  
              of finite groups.  The principal investigator will work on                     
              establishing the weight conjecture.  He will also study the general            
              modular representation theory of Hecke algebras for arbitrary                  
              finite groups and will study coefficient systems on some simplicial            
              complexes related to group structure.                                          
                   This project is in the general area of representation theory              
              of finite groups.  The principal investigator will examine several             
              problems in this area including the weight conjecture.  An                     
              affirmative answer to this conjecture would lead to the solution of            
              several long outstanding problems in this area.
