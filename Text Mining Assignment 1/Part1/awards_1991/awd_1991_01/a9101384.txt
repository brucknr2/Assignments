Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The objective of this research is to investigate the relative                  
              importance of environmental vs. biological effects on the &13C                 
              of POC in the surface layer of the open ocean.  The                            
              distribution of &13CPOC in the ocean as a function of latitude                 
              can not be explained by any single cause, such as temperature,                 
              concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide (?CO2!aq) or lipid                   
              content.  Multicausal explanations will have to be sought to                   
              explain this distribution.  The effects of the composition of                  
              the phytoplankton community on the distribution of &13CPOC in                  
              the ocean will be investigated since physiological                             
              characteristics of 13C fractionation vary among groups of                      
              microalgae and the composition of the phytoplankton community                  
              varies as a function of latitude in the ocean.                                 
                                                                                             
              Patterns of &13C fractionation in different groups of                          
              microalgae in the laboratory and in the field will be                          
              documented as a function of growth rate, cell size and ?CO2!aq.                
              In the field carotenoids will be used as chemosystematic                       
              indicators for the composition of the phytoplankton community                  
              and measure the &13C of carotenoids to determine the &13C of                   
              the different groups of microalgae.  The relationship between                  
              &13CPOC and the &13C of carotenoids will be established for                    
              laboratory cultures.  A comparison of the variations of                        
              &13CPOC and &13Ccarotenoid within the different microalgal                     
              groups along a N-S transect in the North Atlantic will                         
              establish the relative effect of phytoplankton community                       
              composition on the &13C of plankton in the ocean.
