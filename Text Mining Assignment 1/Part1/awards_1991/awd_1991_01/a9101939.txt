Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This applicant will study the genes in yeast that are involved in              
              regulation of entry of the cells into a stationary phase when                  
              placed under inhospitable conditions.  Some genes are expressed                
              only when the cell enters the stationary phase.  Specifically, he              
              plans to study those genes that control expression of the                      
              stationary phase specific genes, and to determine whether there                
              is a causal relationship between expression of those genes and                 
              entry into stationary phase.  Plans call for the work to be                    
              conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Margaret Werner-Washburne at                
              the University of New Mexico.
