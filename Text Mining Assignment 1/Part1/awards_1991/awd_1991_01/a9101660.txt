Abstract    :
                   Professor Richter will study the structure of multiplication              
              by z on a generalized Dirichlet space.  He will attempt to                     
              understand the structure of the invariant subspaces of this                    
              operator.  When the corresponding measure on the unit disk is                  
              Lebesgue measure, then the operator theoretic problems Professor               
              Richter will consider lead to questions involving capacities and               
              exceptional sets of classes of analytic functions.                             
                   This research involves the theory of Hilbert space operators.             
              These operators can be thought of as infinite matrices of complex              
              numbers.  They find application in almost every branch of pure and             
              applied mathematics.  The object of Professor Richter's research is            
              to classify and understand an important family of such operators.
