Abstract    :
                     This project is concerned with the following topics in                  
              commutative algebra:  (1) the structure of the prime ideal spectra             
              and the groups of invertible ideals in certain rings of                        
              integer-valued polynomials;  (2) the structure of the homogeneous              
              complete ideals in the polynomial ring k?X,Y,Z! and the connections            
              with linear systems of curves in the projective plane; and (3) the             
              projective line over a countable 1- dimensional local domain R and             
              the structure of the spectra of integral domains between the                   
              polynomial ring R?X! and its field of fractions.                               
                     Commutative rings are algebraic structures possessing a                 
              commutative addition and a commutative multiplication.  These                  
              structures occur throughout mathematics and algebra.  Common                   
              examples include polynomial rings, and rings of algebraic integers             
              in extension fields of the rationals.  This project is conerned                
              with a variety of questions on the structure of commutative rings.
