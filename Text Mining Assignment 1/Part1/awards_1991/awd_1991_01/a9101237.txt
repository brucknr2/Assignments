Abstract    :
                   The primary focus of this project is producing a unified,                 
              accessible treatment of the existence, uniqueness, and                         
              structure of the sporadic simple groups.  In addition, the                     
              principal investigator will study the action of groups on                      
              finite simplicial complexes.                                                   
                   A group is an algebraic structure with a single                           
              operation.  It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well                   
              as, physics and chemistry.  The fundamental building blocks of                 
              finite groups are finite simple groups.  One of the major                      
              results in mathematics of the past decade is the                               
              classification of finite simple groups, the proof of which                     
              would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal pages.  The research                    
              supported is aimed at simplifying the treatment of the                         
              sporadic simple groups.
