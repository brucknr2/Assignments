Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project involving                      
              the University of Michigan and Bilkent University is in the                    
              general area of systems and control theory.  Project funding                   
              will allow the team from Bilkent University to work for                        
              various periods of time in the laboratory of Dr. Pramod                        
              Khargoneker at the University of Michigan and also allow Dr.                   
              Khargonekar a research visit to Bilkent University.  The                       
              collaborative research will focus on the problem of robust                     
              stabilization for a variety of possible modeling                               
              uncertainties.  The expected theoretical results will yield                    
              sufficient conditions for the solvability of robust                            
              stabilization problems and constructive algorithms for                         
              solving these problems.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This project in engineering systems fulfills the program                       
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Turkey to combine                     
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas                     
              of strong mutual interest and competence.
