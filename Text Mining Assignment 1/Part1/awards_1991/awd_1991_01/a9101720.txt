Abstract    :
                   Professor Driver will study differential and integral analysis            
              on loop spaces.  A primary goal is to prove an infinite dimensional            
              version of Hodge's theorem for loop spaces.  The notion of harmonic            
              forms will be determined by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Lapacian whose               
              exact definition will depend on the measure on the loop space.  An             
              important theme in this work is to prove a logarithmic Sobolev                 
              inequality for the resulting Dirichlet form.                                   
                   This project involves loop spaces.  In the special case of a              
              two dimensional manifold, the loop space is just the family of all             
              continuous closed paths on a surface which start at some fixed                 
              point.  One key idea is to construct a measure on these paths so               
              that one can talk about the "volume" of a set of paths and thus                
              integrate over the loop space.  This is important for understanding            
              the topology of loop spaces and has implications for string theory             
              in physics.
