Abstract    :
              This grant will support experiment which will address a critical               
              issue in undergraduate engineering education.  The test project                
              will be based on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and will               
              involve hardware and software design and development of ancillary              
              systems necessary to carry out scientific and engineering surveys              
              to obtain needed environmental data.                                           
                                                                                             
              The AUV's layered control approach, developed by Rodney Brooks at              
              MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, breaks the robot                     
              control problem into a set of interacting behaviors.  This                     
              enables small student teams to work on a single behavior but also              
              forces them to work collaboratively in order to integrate                      
              interaction among behaviors.  This project will add a new                      
              dimension to Research Experiences for Undergraduates by providing              
              experience in design, engineering, construction, and field                     
              testing.
