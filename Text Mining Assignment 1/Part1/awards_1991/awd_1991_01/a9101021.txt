Abstract    :
              This is a SBIR Phase II project.  The goals of the phase II project            
              are (1) to complete the design and fabrication of a VLSI chip that             
              incorporates a 3-D binary cellular automator which the PI's company            
              has developed jointly with Visual Information Technologies (V Tech)            
              based on the PI's patented architecture.  (2) To incorporate the               
              chip-in Plug-in boards for personnel computers.  (3) to develop the            
              necessary software for the system.  (4) to continue to research and            
              develop the application for 3D cellular automatics.
