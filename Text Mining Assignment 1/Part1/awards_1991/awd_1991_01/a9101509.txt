Abstract    :
              This research focuses upon an important but largely unsolved                   
              problem:  the dynamics of polymers at solid surfaces.  The                     
              experimental strategy will be to make in situ experiments of the               
              kinetics with which polymers first adsorb to a well-characterized              
              single solid surface and then exchange with isotopically labelled              
              polymers originally in free solution.  Time constants will be                  
              determined for the exchange process and also for evolution of the              
              bound fraction.  They will investigate the dynamics underlying an              
              overall equilibrium, chain relaxation between adsorption states,               
              and the times required for reversibility of desorption and                     
              adsorption.  Experimental variables of interest will include                   
              molecular weight of the chains, solution concentration,                        
              thermodynamic quality of the solvent, chain topology (linear and               
              star), hydrodynamic flow conditions, and the functionality as well             
              as density of functionality of the surface.  The method of                     
              investigation will be infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total                
              reflection.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The findings of this research will be correlated with modern                   
              physical theories of polymer behavior and may find application in              
              steric stabilization of colloidal systems, film formation,                     
              chromatography, and lubrication.
