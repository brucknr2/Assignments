Abstract    :
                   This award will support the study of the structure of                     
              various classes of finite and countable rank torsion-free                      
              abelian groups.  Classes of Butler groups will be classified                   
              up to (quasi or near)-isomorphism by invariants in the                         
              tradition of Baer and Ulm invariants.  Various applications                    
              to other areas of algebra, such as representations of finite                   
              posets and finitely generated modules over multiple pullback                   
              rings will also be considered.                                                 
                   This project is in the general area of abelian group                      
              theory and is concerned with the classification of abelian                     
              groups.  Although the classification of finite abelian groups                  
              has been well understood for a century, the classification of                  
              infinite abelian groups remains elusive.  This research                        
              involves this old problem of classification of the infinite                    
              abelian groups approached by new tools from logic and                          
              analysis.
