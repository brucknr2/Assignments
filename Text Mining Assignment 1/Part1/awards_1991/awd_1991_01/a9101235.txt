Abstract    :
                   Robert Penner will study decorated Teichmuller theory in                  
              several directions, as follows.  Integrals of monomials of Miller-             
              Morita-Mumford classes over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces               
              should be computable using intersection theory on an appropriate V-            
              manifold compactification of moduli space; in particular, all the              
              necessary ingredients seem to be in place for applying this scheme             
              to the computation of Weil-Petersson volumes for once-punctured                
              surfaces.  There is also a "universal" analog of the decorated                 
              Teichmuller space, and essentially all of the classical structures             
              extend to this setting; he hopes the study of this universal space             
              will shed light on the classical theory.  He furthermore hopes to              
              compute the complex structure of moduli in his coordinates.                    
              Computer work will be pursued to derive the combinatorial structure            
              of the moduli space of once-punctured surfaces of genus three, and             
              he hopes explicitly to compute the homology of this spaces.                    
              Finally, a program has evolved for extending some of his work to               
              the setting of closed surfaces.                                                
                   Teichmuller theory is a seventy year-old blend of algebraic               
              geometry, differential geometry, and topology.  As such, advances              
              will interest a broad spectrum of mathematicians.  Some also have              
              a bearing on string theory, so some theoretical physicists have a              
              stake in this research as well.
