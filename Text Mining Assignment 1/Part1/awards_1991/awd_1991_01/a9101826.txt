Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will study                     
              various problems in pluri-potential theory that have applications              
              to complex analysis.  The ultimate goal of this work is to                     
              construct an invariant boundary theory for plurisubharmonic                    
              functions and holomorphic functions.  In particular, the                       
              principal investigator will study boundary properties of pluri-                
              subharmonic functions with respect to the Green-Martin topology,               
              the decomposition of plurisubharmonic functions into potentials                
              and maximal functions, the analytic structure of polynomial hulls              
              and Wermer compacta.                                                           
                   The theory of subharmonic functions occupies a special place              
              in complex function theory because of its inherent beauty and                  
              because it is important to various other areas such as the theory              
              of partial differential equations.  In this project the principal              
              investigator will continue working on an analogous theory for                  
              what are called "plurisubharmonic" functions.  Plurisubharmonic                
              functions arise in many different contexts, and a knowledge of                 
              their properties will help us understand a number of problems in               
              differential geometry and complex function theory.
