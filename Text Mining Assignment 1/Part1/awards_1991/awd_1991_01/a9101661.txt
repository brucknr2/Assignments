Abstract    :
                   A set of undergraduate laboratory experiments which                       
              duplicate current ongoing research activities and techniques in                
              the field of atomic/laser physics will be developed.  These                    
              experiments will use tuneable narrowband diode laser systems.                  
              The first experiment is the use of lasers to obtain very high                  
              resolution Doppler-free saturated absorption spectra in alkali                 
              vapor cells.  The majority of the work will be the development of              
              an inexpensive apparatus in which undergraduates can trap neutral              
              atoms and cool them to temperatures on the order of a                          
              microkelvin.  These experiments will be a slightly modified                    
              version of state-of-the-art experiments in laser cooling and                   
              trapping, and will be tested in an advanced lab course.  The goal              
              of the work will be the development of a very simple                           
              inexpensive apparatus which can be widely duplicated, and                      
              which will allow undergraduates to become involved in a                        
              current area of physics research.
