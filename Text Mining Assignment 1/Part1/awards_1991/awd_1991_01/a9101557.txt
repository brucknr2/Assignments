Abstract    :
                   Professor Moscovici will exploit the tools of non-commutative             
              differential geometry and of non-commutative harmonic analysis for             
              the investigation of differential and topological invariants of                
              multiply connected manifolds.  The first part of his project                   
              concerns invariants of index type and is a continuation of his work            
              on the Novikov conjecture.  The second part, which represents a new            
              line of research, deals with the more subtle secondary-type                    
              invariants (e.g. analytic torsion and the eta invariant) and aims              
              to place them in the framework of cyclic (co)homology and algebraic            
              K-theory.                                                                      
                   A manifold is the generalization to higher dimensions of a                
              smooth two dimensional surface.  For example, the space-time                   
              continuum is a four dimension manifold.  Professor Moscovici's                 
              research is aimed at understanding these geometric objects by                  
              exploiting connections with the theory of linear transformations               
              (infinite matrices) in infinite dimensional spaces.
