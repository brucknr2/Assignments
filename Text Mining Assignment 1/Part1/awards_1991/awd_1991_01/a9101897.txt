Abstract    :
              The relationship between structure and properties of metallic                  
              glasses and their surfaces and interfaces will be studied in                   
              a combined theoretical and experimental effort.                                
              Specifically, thermodynamic, vibrational and interfacial                       
              properties will be studied.  Nano clusters will be produced                    
              and analyzed by neutron diffraction and the results compared                   
              with computer simulations using the embedded atom method.                      
              Thermodynamic properties will be determined from emf                           
              measurements and by using differential scanning calorimetry.
