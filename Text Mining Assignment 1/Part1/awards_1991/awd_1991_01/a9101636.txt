Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The analysis of a hydrographic and acoustic Doppler current                    
              profiler section of the tropical north Atlantic at 11 degrees N                
              will be completed. The objectives of the work are to calculate the             
              meridional heat and fresh water fluxes and the transport of various            
              deep water masses. This work is collaborative with scientists at               
              the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
