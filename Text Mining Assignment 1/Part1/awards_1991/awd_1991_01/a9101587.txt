Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed experimental research program is designed to                      
              address those fundamental, structural, mesogenic, and                          
              configurational features of liquid crystalline polymers and                    
              closely related polymer structures which confer high barrier                   
              properties upon liquid crystalline polymers as a class of                      
              materials.  The research will focus upon explicit comparison                   
              of the properties of isotropic, amorphous, and disordered                      
              polymers and the identical polymers which have developed                       
              liquid crystalline order by solvent or thermal treatment.                      
              Moreover, the effect of systematic structure and                               
              configurational changes on sorption and transport behavior of                  
              liquid crystalline polymers will further define the role of                    
              liquid crystalline order on the barrier properties of liquid                   
              crystalline polymeric materials.  These fundamental studies                    
              are directed toward developing an expanded and more subtle                     
              repertoire of structural modifications which would be useful                   
              for the rational tailoring of super-barriers based upon liquid                 
              crystalline polymers and will also provide useful mechanistic                  
              insight into the fundamental basis for high permeability in                    
              disordered rigid-rod polymeric materials.  Central to the                      
              thesis under consideration is the notion that extremely subtle                 
              structural, mesogenic, and configurational features                            
              distinguish the most permeable from the least permeable                        
              polymeric materials.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This project is jointly supported by NSF and the Electric                      
              Power Research Institute (EPRI), following a special NSF-EPRI                  
              research initiative on polymeric materials.
