Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with several aspects of the                     
              representation theory of semisimple algebraic groups over fields               
              of prime characteristic, with applications to finite groups of                 
              Lie type.  Recent ideas of Lusztig relating quantum groups and                 
              modular representations will be explored, with emphasis on                     
              injective modules.  Representations arising from the cohomology                
              of line bundles on flag varieties will be another central issue;               
              a major question here concerns the relationship with                           
              Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for the affine Weyl group.  The study              
              of algebraic groups should provide further insight into                        
              representations of associated finite simple groups; here a number              
              of open questions and conjectures about injective modules and                  
              decomposition behavior mod p of ordinary characters will be                    
              studied.                                                                       
                   This research is in the general area of algebraic groups.                 
              The proposed research falls under two broad headings: cohomology               
              of line bundles on flag varieties, and injective modules.                      
              Advances along these lines would both shed light on Lusztig's                  
              conjecture, as well as point the way beyond it.
