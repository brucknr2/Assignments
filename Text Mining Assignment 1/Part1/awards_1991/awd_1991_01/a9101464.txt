Abstract    :
              Kehl         This project involves building and measuring two self-timed 
              components inserted into an existing shared-memory multiprocessor  computer
              system.  The two components are a multilayered backplane  with self-timed
              arbitration logic and a self-timed memory module.   The goals are to
              demonstrate the ability to increase the number  of processors while also
              doubling memory performance for this  system.  This project is testing the
              viability of self-tuning  systems (the system is self-tuning in that the
              operating margins  are adjusted based on the actual components used in the
              system).
