Abstract    :
                   The main purpose of this research project is to study the                 
              topology and geometry of low and higher dimensional manifolds.                 
              Particular attention will be paid to symmetries of manifolds.                  
              The problems which will be studied cover a large spectrum of                   
              questions, ranging from very specific problems concerning low-                 
              dimensional manifolds to general problems concerning the geometry              
              of positively curved higher dimensional manifolds.  The main                   
              techniques which will be employed in this research include: gauge              
              theory, surgery, homotopy theory, transformation groups and                    
              differential geometry.                                                         
                   Manifolds are very natural objects to study.  They are the                
              spaces which are locally like Euclidean spaces.  For example, the              
              space in which we live (ignoring time), has three dimensions,                  
              making it a three-dimensional manifold, locally, but not                       
              necessarily globally, like Euclidean three-space.  Taking time                 
              into account, physical space becomes a four-dimensional manifold.              
              Whether it is globally Euclidean four-space or some other,                     
              possibly bounded, four-dimensional manifold is a deep question of              
              cosmology.  Answering this question is not a matter for                        
              mathematics alone, but exploring the various possibilities is an               
              important and properly mathematical matter.
