Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor I. Gessel                   
              to work in enumerative combinatorics.  He intends to study                     
              hypergeometric series, polyominos and Joyal's theory of species                
              of structures.                                                                 
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design                
              of algorithms in computer science.
