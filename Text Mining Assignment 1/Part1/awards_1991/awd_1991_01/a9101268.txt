Abstract    :
                   Professor Xia will study a number of topics in the theory of              
              almost commuting n-tuples of Hilbert space operators.  He will                 
              investigate cyclic cohomology and trace formulas for almost                    
              commuting n-tuples.  He will study the theory of n-tuples of almost            
              unperturbed Schrodinger operators and he will try to find a                    
              complete set of unitary invariants for subnormal tuples of                     
              operators.                                                                     
                   This research involves the theory of Hilbert space operators.             
              These operators can be thought of as infinite matrices of complex              
              numbers.  They find application in almost every branch of pure and             
              applied mathematics.  The object of Professor Xia's research is to             
              classify and understand important families of these operators.
