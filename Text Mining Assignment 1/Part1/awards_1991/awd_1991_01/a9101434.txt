Abstract    :
                   The question of how various scales of motion in the                       
              atmosphere interact with one another is one of the more                        
              fundamental unanswered questions in the meteorological sciences.               
              The transfer of energy between scales is a major factor in                     
              organizing locally severe weather such as heavy snowfalls and                  
              thunderstorms and our lack of understanding of these processes is              
              a major obstacle to fundamentally improving prediction of such                 
              phenomena.                                                                     
                   In this research, the Principal Investigator will study the               
              internal and external scale interaction processes affecting the                
              evolution of warm core convective disturbances.  The studied                   
              phenomena will include collections of thunderstorms, known as                  
              mesoscale convective complexes, and tropical cyclones.  His                    
              research objectives will be accomplished primarily through                     
              numerical modeling and should shed light on the important                      
              dynamical interactions that control these severe weather                       
              producing systems.
