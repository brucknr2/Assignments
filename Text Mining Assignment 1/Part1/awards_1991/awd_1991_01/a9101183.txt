Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The organic carbon cycle will be studied at two open ocean                     
              sites which reflect potential differences in carbon derived                    
              from marine and terrestrial sources.  Studies of carbon                        
              isotopes and dissolved and particulate organic carbon will be                  
              conducted at Station "M" in the Northeast Pacific Ocean and in                 
              the Amazon River plume region of the Atlantic Ocean.  The                      
              control of DOC concentrations and . 14C values by natural                      
              microbial assemblages will also be evaluated.  Relationships                   
              between the different carbon pools, including sedimentary                      
              organic carbon (SOC), will be assessed at Station "M" during                   
              periods of high and low primary productivity and in a transect                 
              of Amazon River plume/Atlantic Ocean waters.                                   
                                                                                             
              The following questions will be addressed:  (1) Are carbon                     
              species and . 14C gradients a function of seasonal carbon flux                 
              rates in the open ocean?  (2) What is the contribution of                      
              terrestrially derived carbon species to the open ocean?  (3)                   
              Are isotopes activities fractionated with respect to particle                  
              size and/or organic composition?  (4) What fraction of the                     
              total DOC pool is potentially labile and truly refractory, and                 
              what are the . 14C signatures of each fraction?
