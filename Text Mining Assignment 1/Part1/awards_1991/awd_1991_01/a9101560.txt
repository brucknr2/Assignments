Abstract    :
                   This research is in the area of network information theory                
              with emphasis on the development and analysis of new coding                    
              techniques for efficient matching of correlated information sources            
              to multi-terminal channels and the conditions under which these                
              coding schemes are optimal.  The new coding schemes are based on               
              joint source and channel coding rather than separate coding for                
              source and channel.  The performance of new coding techniques is               
              compared to the existing schemes and also to separate coding for               
              the information source and the communication channel.  Special                 
              emphasis is placed on the investigation of the performance of the              
              proposed coding schemes under various types of channel impairments,            
              such as symbol and block asynchronism.  Different types of source-             
              channel configurations, including cases with feedback, are studied             
              and the possibility of optimal separate and channel coding in each             
              case is investigated.
