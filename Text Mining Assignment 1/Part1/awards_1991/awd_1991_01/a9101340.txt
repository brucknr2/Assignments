Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided to study the effect of seawater on newly formed             
              oceanic crust during hydrothermal circulation processes.  This will            
              be accomplished through the analysis of elemental flux between                 
              seawater and crust by studying 500 m of layer 3 gabbros cored                  
              during ODP drilling on SW Indian Ridge.  These processes exert                 
              major control over the chemistry of elements in ocean and their                
              understanding is thus important to the study of paleoechemistry.
