Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This applicant will study black-white differences in adolescent                
              drug use.  Specifically, the work aims to clarify the sources of               
              race differences in drug use and to improve understanding of the               
              correlates, causes and long-term consequences of drug use among                
              black youth.  The work is planned to take place with Dr. Jerald                
              Bachman in the Institute of Social Research at the University of               
              Michigan.
