Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professors E. Schmutz and             
              W. Goh to work in combinatorics.  They intend to investigate                   
              asymptotic properties of several families of random combinatorial              
              structures.  They intend to determine whether or not asymptotic                
              value distributions exist, and in the situation where they do, to              
              find them.                                                                     
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
