Abstract    :
                   This project will consider viscosity solutions for partial                
              differential equations.  Uniqueness of viscosity solutions to                  
              second order elliptic equations with measurable coefficients,                  
              minimal surface equations, the p-Laplacian, and certain Cauchy                 
              problems in bounded domains will be studied.  Based on                         
              preliminary results, various maximum principles and regularity                 
              theory will be developed.                                                      
                   While this project is aimed at theoretical aspects of                     
              partial differential equations, the results have almost immediate              
              applications in areas such as control theory and finance.
