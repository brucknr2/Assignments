Abstract    :
              This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science                            
              Program will support collaborative research in Physics                         
              to be carried out by Dr. Walter E. Meyerhof of                                 
              Stanford University and Dr. Eduardo C. Montenegro of                           
              Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro,                              
              Brazil.  The project focuses on the study of charge                            
              changing processes (electron capture and loss) by                              
              ionic projectiles impinging on gaseous targets.                                
                                                                                             
              This continuing and successful collaboration will be                           
              carried out at the Stanford University FN Tandem                               
              accelerator and at the Van de Graaff accelerator at                            
              the Pontifical Catholic University.  The study will                            
              focus on the electron-electron interaction in the                              
              electron loss by various light projectiles passing                             
              through hydrogen and helium gas targets.  Both total                           
              and differential loss cross sections will be measured.                         
              An atomic hydrogen target will be constructed in the                           
              Brazilian site that will enable investigation into the                         
              differences between molecular and atomic hydrogen                              
              interacting with light projectiles.
