Abstract    :
                   This project will study uniqueness and stability of solutions             
              of well known inverse problems.  This problems arise in areas as               
              diverse as geophysics, electrical tomography, crack detection,                 
              earthquake prediction, and acoustic and seismic prospecting.                   
              Fundamental mathematical issues will be studied through the use of             
              advanced techniques such as Carleman estimates and Calderon-                   
              Sylvester-Uhlmann methods.
