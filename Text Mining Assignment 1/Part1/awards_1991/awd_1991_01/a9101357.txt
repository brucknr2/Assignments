Abstract    :
              Professor Ezra is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and                
              Computational Chemistry Program to study energy transfer and                   
              unimolecular decay using both classical and quantum mechanics,                 
              ion-neutral molecule collisions by classical trajectory                        
              methods, and electron correlation in doubly-excited states of                  
              two-electron atoms by semiclassical methods.  The goals of the                 
              project are to enhance our understanding of these processes, to                
              obtain insight into the relation between intramolecular energy                 
              flow and unimolecular decay rates, and to develop a novel                      
              approach to two-electron correlation. The examples to be                       
              studied are the HOOH molecule, the Li positive ion with                        
              molecular nitrogen, and the helium atom.

              The transfer of energy within a molecule, leading up to its                    
              dissociation into fragments, and the low-energy collisions                     
              between an ion and a neutral molecule, resulting in                            
              deactivation of the vibrationally-excited ion, will be studied                 
              by a combination of classical and quantum mechanics. These are                 
              two of the most fundamental processes by which energy is                       
              transferred within and between molecules.
