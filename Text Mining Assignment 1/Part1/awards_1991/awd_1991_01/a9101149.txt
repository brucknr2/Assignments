Abstract    :
              This project will continue research on the computational complexity of         
              differential and integral equations.  Past experience in this area has         
              shown that standard formulations of these problems are often                   
              intractable.  A goal of this project is to develop new formulations of         
              these problems that are still practical, but may lead to tractable             
              problems.  These formulations will be based on the information-based           
              complexity theory.
