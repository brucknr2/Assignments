Abstract    :
              The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will receive support                  
              for shipboard technician activities associated with the three                  
              major research vessels that are operated by the Institution.                   
              A significant portion of the ships' operating schedules in                     
              recent years and again in 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored                  
              research projects.  The Shipboard Technician Program has two                   
              components: an at-sea component and an ashore component.                       
                                                                                             
              The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                        
              personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment;                            
              maintenance, repair, and calibration of scientific                             
              instrumentation; instruction and supervision of deck                           
              operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-coming                    
              and off-going scientific parties.  On shore activities                         
              include the maintenance, repair, and calibration of shared                     
              use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel in                   
              preparing for field work on the vessel.  Shipboard                             
              technicians funded by this award have broad responsibilities                   
              for providing the coordination and assistance needed for the                   
              successful completion of research projects at sea.  The level                  
              of activity and amount of support are closely related to the                   
              size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit                   
              and capability.
