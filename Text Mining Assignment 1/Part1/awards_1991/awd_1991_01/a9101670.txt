Abstract    :
              The structural features of M1 RNA and C5 protein (the catalytic RNA            
              subunit and the protein subunit, respectively, of RNase P from E.              
              coli) which are required for catalysis and the accurate cleavage               
              of tRNA precursor molecules will be investigated by utilizing                  
              subunits of the enzyme that have been altered by chemical and                  
              enzymatic methods.  In addition, nucleotide sequences of the analog            
              of M1 RNA from several eucaryotic organisms will be determined                 
              using a technique based on the PCR reaction in order to test a                 
              universal model of the secondary structure of these RNAs.  Subunits            
              of the enzyme, in combination with certain modified substrates,                
              will be used to improve the yield of enzyme-substrate complexes,               
              and, thereby, to facilitate identification and study by chemical               
              techniques of the active site of the enzyme.  Model substrates with            
              phosphorothioates located at the site of cleavage by the enzyme                
              will be used to test predictions concerning the reaction mechanism.            
              Model substrates will also be synthesized to elaborate the features            
              of substrates that determine the site of cleavage by the enzyme.               
              Attempts to crystallize RNase P from E. coli will proceed                      
              concurrently.
