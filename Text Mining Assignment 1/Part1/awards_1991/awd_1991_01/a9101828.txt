Abstract    :
                   This project will consider existence, regularity, local and               
              global behavior, and symmetry of solutions to nonlinear elliptic               
              equations and variational inequalities.  Particular emphasis will              
              be placed on semilinear elliptic equations in the open space,                  
              scalar curvature equations, and variational inequalities.                      
                   These problems come from questions in pure and applied                    
              mathematics.  The results are of interests to fields ranging from              
              diffential geometry to lubrication.
