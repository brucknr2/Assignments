Abstract    :
                   This research program is concerned with the development of                
              both theoretical and computational tools for the analysis of                   
              stochastic discrete-event dynamic systems (DEDS).  Such systems                
              arise naturally in the analysis of modern manufacturing facilities,            
              telecommunications networks, and computing/database machines.  It              
              is intended to establish basic algorithms (primarily simulation-               
              oriented) for the efficient numerical computation of performance               
              measures associated with such systems.                                         
                   Although the primary goal is to develop theoretical and                   
              algorithmic tools,  it is expected that the research program will              
              develop theory and methodology that will positively contribute to              
              applied probability, queueing theory, and discrete-event                       
              simulation.
