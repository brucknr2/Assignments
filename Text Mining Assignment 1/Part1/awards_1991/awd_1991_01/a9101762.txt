              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr.                    
              John Scarpa of the Rutgers University Shellfish Research                       
              Laboratory to conduct collaborative research with Dr.                          
              Katsuhiko T. Wada for 18 months at the National Research                       
              Institute of Aquaculture in Mie, Japan.  They will study the                   
              parthenogenetic and gynogenetic methods of developing a pure                   
              breeding line for a bivalve mollusc, either the oyster                         
              Crassostrea gigas or clam Mactra chinensis.                                    
                                                                                             
              Parthenogenesis and gynogenesis have been suggested as the                     
              two most efficient methods for quickly developing pure-                        
              breeding lines of bivalve molluscs for aquacultural purposes.                  
              These methods have been successful with fish, sea star, sea                    
              urchin, and sea cucumber, but have not produced viable                         
              bivalve molluscs.  A comparative description of spindle                        
              apparatus formation during anaphase I of normally and                          
              parthenogenetically or gynogenetically developing bivalves                     
              will direct future production of pure-breeding lines of                        
              molluscs for aquaculture.  Dr. Scarpa's techniques in                          
              inducing parthenogenetic and gynogenetic development will                      
              complement Dr. Wada's expertise in molluscan genetics,                         
              specifically, the Japanese pearl oyster.
