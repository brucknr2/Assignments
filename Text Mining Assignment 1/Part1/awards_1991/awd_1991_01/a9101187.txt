Abstract    :
              The primary of the proposed research is to develop                             
              the materials, processing, and device technologies                             
              necessary for the realization of GexSi1-x/Si                                   
              optoelectronic devices and integrated circuits.                                
              Previous work in this area has relied almost entirely                          
              on III-V compound materials such as GaAs and                                   
              InP.  Recent improvements in the synthesis of                                  
              GexSi1-x epitaxial layers (both single layers and                              
              superlattice structures) on Si substrates, however,                            
              have resulted in a viable and attractive Si-based                              
              alternative.  In addition, initial research indicates                          
              that superlattice effects such as the Quantum                                  
              Confined Stark Effect and Wannier-Stark                                        
              Localization are present in GexSi1-x superlattice                              
              structures.  As a result, it will be possible, for the                         
              first time, to fabricate active waveguide modulators                           
              and switches on Si substrates.  This program will                              
              take advantage of standard Si integrated circuit                               
              technology with its benefits of low cost, high yield,                          
              and proven reliability.  The program will have two                             
              thrust areas: (1) materials synthesis and                                      
              characterization and (2) design, fabrication, and                              
              characterization of GexSi1-x devices.
