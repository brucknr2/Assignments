Abstract    :
                   Professor Stanton will continue her research in partial                   
              differential equations related to geometry and function theory of              
              several complex variables. In particular, she will study the                   
              singularities of kernels associated with the d"-Neumann problem                
              including the heat kernel. She will also study the heat kernel on              
              a CR manifold and attempt to describe the behavior of the kernel in            
              terms of the geometry of the manifold.                                         
                   This award will support research in an area of mathematics                
              which relates geometry to partial differential equations. The                  
              equations contain local information about a space and the goal of              
              the research is to patch together this local information to obtain             
              global geometric information. The partial differential equation                
              which is central to this research is tied to the equation which                
              models heat flow in a material.
