Abstract    :
                   This project will consider problems in the theory of partial              
              differential equations related to quasiregular mappings in                     
              Euclidean space of dimension at least 3, in an attempt to extend               
              to higher dimensions some aspects of classical function theory.                
              The underlying potential theory in Euclidean space is nonlinear                
              and harmonic functions are replaced by solutions of certain                    
              quasilinear equations which are invariant in a certain sense                   
              under quasiregular mappings.  Quasiconformal mappings are well                 
              suited to be studied with analytic methods via these quasilinear               
              elliptic equations. They are closed under composition, making                  
              them very useful in Topology and Geometry.  These studies are                  
              important in the mathematical modelling of non-newtonian fluids                
              and creep of metals.  Further connections to benefit applied                   
              science as well as pure mathematics will be sought.
