Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will result in a computer program                                  
              for practical nonlinear analysis of concrete                                   
              arch dams under earthquake loading.  Vertical                                  
              contraction joints and horizontal cracking                                     
              planes will be approximately represented by                                    
              the 'smearing' procedure with a single shell                                   
              element discretization in the thickness                                        
              direction.  The program will achieve a                                         
              balance between the importance of various                                      
              parameters of the problem (opening, closing                                    
              and sliding of joints and cracks,                                              
              hydrodynamic interaction, foundation                                           
              interaction, etc.) and the accuracy to which                                   
              they are modeled.  The level of accuracy will                                  
              be sufficient to make more definite                                            
              conclusions regarding the seismic safety of                                    
              arch dams than is currently possible with                                      
              linearly elastic analysis.  The computational                                  
              requirements will be small enough so that the                                  
              program can function as practical tool.                                        
              Since many seismic assessments of concrete                                     
              arch dams are unsatisfactorily based on                                        
              results of linearly elastic analysis, a                                        
              practical nonlinear analysis tool is needed.
