Abstract    :
                   The ability to describe complex bodies of data by                         
              mathematical models is an essential and challenging task.  The                 
              investigator of this award expands the horizon for model fitting.              
              The work on generalized model fitting is expected to have great                
              impact on data analysis.                                                       
                   The investigation will consider the estimation of nuisance                
              dispersion parameters by partially Bayes methods.  It will also                
              examine the relationship between the adjusted profile likelihood               
              and the modified profile likelihood methods.
