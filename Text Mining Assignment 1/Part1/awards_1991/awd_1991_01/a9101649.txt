Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project involves the dissertation research of a                  
              graduate student in linguistic anthropology who will study the                 
              semantics of illness speech in a Mayan Indian community in                     
              southern Mexico.  The project, based on structured interviewing                
              and lexicographic techniques, represents one of the first                      
              attempts to concentrate on the overall semantic characteristics                
              of language signs and symptoms of a group.  The researcher will                
              select 50 health conditions for in-depth study about symptoms                  
              (how it feels to the afflicted person) and signs (how it appears               
              to observers).  The researcher will analyze the semantic                       
              patternsin this data and place it in the context of other                      
              analyses (of botanical and ethnopharmacological semantic domains)              
              of this community's semantics, as well as comparing it to other                
              near-by community speech patterns.                                             
                                                                                             
              This research is important because understanding of medical                    
              problems in their cultural context is a crucial factor in                      
              addressing health issues in any society.  In-depth understanding               
              of this one case will help build general theory on the semantics               
              of illness.  Recording and preserving indigenous ethnomedical                  
              knowledge is an important part of preserving global biodiversity.
