Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research              
                                                                                            
              of Professor Shevlin under the Small Grants for Exploratory                    
              Research (SGER) Program. The results of this research will give                
              new understanding to the mechanism of formation of the recently                
              discovered C60 allotrope of carbon, which possesses a geodesic                 
              (Buckminster Fuller) structure. In addition, reaction of C60 will              
                                                                                             
              be studied. There is intense interest in the formation, reactions,             
                                                                                             
              and properties of this allotrope of carbon (graphite and diamond               
              are examples of other allotropes of carbon).                                   
                                                                                             
              It is thought that atomic carbon forms small reactive fragments,               
              which then undergo further reactions to eventually produce C60.                
              This hypothesis will be tested in experiments designed to trap the             
                                                                                             
              smaller fragment precursors to C60. Abstractable hydrogen will be              
                                                                                             
              added to the helium bath gas as the trapping reagent, with the                 
              expectation that the size of carbon clusters which are trapped                 
              will be directly proportional to bath gas pressure and inversely               
              proportional to the amount of trapping reagent. In addition, the               
              reactions of some reactive intermediates (carbenes and benzyne)                
              with C60 will be studied. Reaction of chromium hexacarbonyl with               
              C60 will also be explored.
