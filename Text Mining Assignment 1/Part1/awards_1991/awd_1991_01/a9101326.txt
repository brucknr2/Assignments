Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program seeks to use non-equilibrium molecular dynamics                   
              simulation techniques to develop an molecular level                            
              understanding of the transport properties of Newtonian fluids                  
                                                                                             
              and mixtures and to the non-Newtonian rheological properties                   
              of polymeric fluids.  For Newtonian fluids, particular                         
              attention will be focused on the viscosity, thermal                            
              conductivity, and mutual diffusion in representative liquid                    
              mixtures.  For non-newtonian fluids, attention will be                         
              directed towards the stress tensor in both steady-state and                    
              transient states.
