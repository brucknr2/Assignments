Abstract    :
              The instrument development work described here will greatly                    
              expand and enhance the capabilities of our existing ("prototype")              
              high sensitivity flow cytometer for the analysis of natural                    
              microbial populations.  Specifically, we propose to:                           
                                                                                             
              . Install an argon-krypton mixed gas laser to provide a wide                   
                choice of excitation wavelengths.                                            
                                                                                             
              . Add the optics and electronics required for dual beam                        
                excitation and 4 channel detection.                                          
                                                                                             
              . Develop a highly flexible data acquisition system based on                   
                off-the-shelf electronics modules.                                           
                                                                                             
              . Interface the flow cytometer with a real-time neural net-based               
                data analysis system.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The instrument will be used to develop methods of identifying and              
                                                                                             
              enumerating specific microorganisms in natural samples (based on               
              16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes), and of analyzing in                 
              situ physiological parameters (using more traditional                          
              cytochemical techniques).  The flow cytometer will also be used                
              to support ongoing studies of cell cycle regulation in bacteria                
              and microalgae.
