Abstract    :
                   The first of two distinct parts of this research is the                   
              development of statistical models and of procedures for statistical            
              inference for data in the form of rankings or even partial                     
              rankings.  These models should allow examination of the same kinds             
              of relationships frequently modeled for numerical data; and this               
              research based on orthogonal contrasts may lead to a general                   
              framework for the analysis of ranking data.                                    
                   The second part of the research develops further Item Response            
              Theory, appropriate to many standardized multiple item tests used              
              to measure ability and performance.  In particular, this research              
              will provide a rigorous mathematical framework  for focussing on a             
              multidimensional Item Response Theory, on bias detection                       
              procedures, and on more fundamental issues in probabilistic models             
              for response.
