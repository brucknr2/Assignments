Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research on the geochemistries of the major biochemicals will                  
              continue by:                                                                   
                                                                                             
              a).  Isolating different particle classes from sediment                        
                   mixtures and then determining the major biochemical                       
                   components, their microenvironments, and potential                        
                   reactivities toward chemical and biological agents.                       
                                                                                             
              b).  Studying the distribution and bonding of ester-bound                      
                   phenolic acids in a taxonomic cross section of                            
                   nonwoody vascular plant tissues and relating this                         
                   information to the diverse compositions and                               
                   diagenetic patterns typical of these biochemically                        
                   complex materials.                                                        
                                                                                             
              c).  Investigating the growing evidence for a major                            
                   polysaccharide component of vascular plant tissues                        
                   that is not accounted for by conventional molecular-                      
                   level analyses.
