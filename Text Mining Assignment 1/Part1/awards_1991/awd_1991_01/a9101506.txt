Abstract    :
                   This continuing research program includes six topics: 1) a                
              20-year perspective of several scales of disturbance on three                  
              species of kelp that will be continued with long term demographic              
              studies in five areas; 2) thinning experiments searching for                   
              thresholds necessary for understory persistence in different                   
              regions;  3) evaluation of intra- and interspecific density                    
              effect on kelp growth, reproduction, recruitment, and                          
              survivorship;  4) an experimental evaluation of fundamental vs.                
              realized niches of kelps in the presence of a strong competitive               
              dominant, and 5) the effects of long shore and cross shore                     
              gradients, especially light and temperature with regard to                     
              succession theory. The investigators are also (6) using                        
              outplants to evaluate some adaptive tactics of four species of                 
              relatively rare kelps that have very different life histories.                 
              For most of the experiments they will use triplicated clearings                
              at each of four depths and modules with different densities of                 
              sporophytes to evaluate regional and density thresholds on                     
              growth, time and intensity of reproduction, recruitment, and                   
              survivorship.
