Abstract    :
              The School of Ocean and Earth Sciences & Technology at the                     
              University of Hawaii will continue shipboard technician                        
              activities associated with the research vessel MOANA WAVE, a                   
              210-foot vessel that is owned by the Navy and operated by the                  
              University.  A significant portion of the MOANA WAVE's                         
              operating schedule in recent years and again in during 1991                    
              is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The                         
              Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-sea                     
              component and an ashore component.                                             
                                                                                             
              The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                        
              personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; mainte-                    
              nance, repair, and calibration of scientific instrumentation;                  
              instruction and supervision of deck operations; and providing                  
              logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going scientific                     
              parties.  On shore activities include the maintenance,                         
              repair, and calibration of shared use seagoing equipment and                   
              assisting scientific personnel in preparing for field work on                  
              the vessel.  Shipboard technicians funded by this award have                   
              broad responsibilities for providing the coordination and                      
              assistance needed for the successful completion of research                    
              projects at sea.  The level of activity and amount of support                  
              are closely related to the size and capability of the vessel,                  
              and its scientific outfit and capability.
