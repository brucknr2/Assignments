Abstract    :
              This project continues the past research program in unconstrained and          
              constrained optimization.  The project has three main parts.  First,           
              limited memory methods will be developed for large bound constrained           
              and nonlinearly constrained optimization problems.  A new algebraic            
              representation of the limited memory update developed earlier will             
              greatly facilitate the use of the limited memory approached for                
              constrained optimization, and should help produce very efficient               
              methods for large constrained problems.  Second, tensor methods will           
              be developed for large, sparse nonlinear problems, including nonlinear         
              equations, nonlinear least squares, and unconstrained optimization,            
              and also for nonlinearly constrained optimization problems.  This              
              approach shows great promise of producing methods that are very robust         
              and efficient on nonsingular and singular problems and that, in the            
              sparse case, can efficiently use any desired direct or iterative               
              solver.  Third, new trust region methods will be developed and                 
              analyzed for nonlinearly constrained optimization problems with                
              inequality and equality constraints.  These methods are expected to            
              have strong global convergence properties even in the presence of              
              linearly dependent constraint gradients, and to perform robustly and           
              efficiently in practice.  In addition, research will be carried out on         
              a modified Cholesky factorization for large sparse constrained                 
              optimization, and on efficient methods for implicit nonlinear least            
              squares problems.
