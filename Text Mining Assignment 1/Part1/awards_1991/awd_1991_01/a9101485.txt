Abstract    :
                   This project will study existence and regularity of                       
              solutions for nonlinear dispersive equations.  The main topics to              
              be considered are the development of singularities, the life span              
              of solutions, and blow up of solutions to thermoelasticity                     
              equations.  The techniques to be  employed come mainly from                    
              harmonic analysis and apriori estimates for commutators. The                   
              questions to be analyzed are state of the art mathematical                     
              problems in equations modeling phenomena in physics and                        
              engineering.
