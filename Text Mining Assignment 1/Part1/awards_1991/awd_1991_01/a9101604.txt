Abstract    :
              This workshop will plan the International Tundra Experiment                    
              (ITEX).  The workshop will bring together an international                     
              group of experienced arctic botanists and soil ecologists to                   
              identify and design a simple experiment which will                             
              contribute to the understanding and prediction of the                          
              effects of climate change on arctic plant populations.  This                   
              planning effort will contribute to the terrestrial component                   
              NSF's Arctic System Science Program and could serve as a                       
              model for further international experiments involving other                    
              critical biological taxa such as invertebrates,                                
              microorganisms and valuable subsistence species.  The                          
              results and recommendations will be promptly and widely                        
              published.
