Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Stang will                 
              continue to study novel unsaturated species and intermediates                  
              and their chemistry. Specific areas of research to be pursued                  
              by Dr. Stang include: (i) generation and chemistry of diatomic                 
              carbon and ylides derived from diatomic carbon, (ii) mechanism                 
              of Ni-Pd-Pt mediated unsaturated cross-couplings and                           
              unsaturated carboxylations, (iii) homogeneous C-H bond                         
              activation and heterobimetallic complexes, (iv) synthesis and                  
              chemistry of highly strained ring systems, and (v) synthesis of                
              (presumably stable) xenon-carbon species.                                      
                                                                                             
              The long-range objectives of Dr. Stang's project, which is                     
              concerned with several areas of mechanistic (physical-organic)                 
              and organometallic chemistry, include: (i) synthesis,                          
              characterization, and studies of various aspects of the                        
              chemistry of novel reactive intermediates (e.g., diatomic                      
              carbon, unsaturated carbenes), and (ii) fundamental mechanistic                
              studies of such organometallic reactions as vinylic                            
              cross-coupling and homogeneous activation of carbon-hydrogen                   
              bonds. It is anticipated that this broad and diverse program of                
              fundamental research will provide (i) new mechanistic insight                  
              into extensively used modern synthetic reactions and (ii) new                  
              routes for synthesizing reactive intermediates in solution.
