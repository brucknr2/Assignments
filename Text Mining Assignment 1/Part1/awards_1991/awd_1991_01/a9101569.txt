Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor James Liggett of Cornell                     
              University in a research collaboration with Professor Gustavo                  
              Ayala of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).                   
              The objective of their research is to study leaks in water                     
              distribution systems by directing a measurement program so                     
              that leaks can be detected with minimum effort.  Such a program                
              can be automated and the analysis made continuously to find                    
              anomalies in the system.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Leaks in water distribution systems are a common occurrence,                   
              whether they are caused by a catastrophic event such as an                     
              earthquake or by slow deterioration.  Detection of such leaks                  
              is a major problem.  As a result of the 1985 earthquake,                       
              Mexican officials have expressed a willingness to collect                      
              additional data as required for relevant research on the Mexico                
              City water distribution system and to carry on experiments in                  
              small portions of the distribution system.  The Mexican side                   
              will also provide software that is useful for computation in                   
              water distribution systems while the U.S. side will address                    
              parameter identification types of calculations.   As                           
              envisioned, this collaborative research cooperation offers a                   
              golden opportunity to test algorithms with real data under                     
              realistic situations and, consequently, has the potential to                   
              develop effective procedures for leak detection and damage                     
              control.
