Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to study scheduling problems            
              occurring in flow lines used in manufacturing and assembly.  The               
              basic problem involves a system consisting of a number of stages               
              in series with parallel machines at each stage.  The goals of the              
              research are to develop rules and heuristics for the basic problem             
              and to develop efficient algorithms for more complicated and                   
              realistic scenarios.                                                           
                   The problems to be studied are motivated by scheduling                    
              problems occuring in several manufacturing and assembly facilities             
              in the United States and will be carried out in collaboration with             
              several industrial research centers.
