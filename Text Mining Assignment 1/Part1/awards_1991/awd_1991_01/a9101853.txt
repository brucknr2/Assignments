Abstract    :
                   A 32 node parallel processing computer will be used at                    
              the San Diego Supercomputer Center to investigate a variety of                 
              problems in theoretical elementary particle physics whose                      
              solution requires a high degree of computational power.  The                   
              problems will be tackled by replacing the continuum of space                   
              and time by a discrete lattice of points.  This approach will                  
              be used to calculate quantities relating to the masses of the                  
              elementary particles and to the behavior of these particles                    
              with respect to both the strong and the weak nuclear forces.                   
              It is hoped that progress will be made on major questions that                 
              cannot be addressed in any other way.  Techniques for                          
              effectively carrying out physics computations on highly-                       
              parallel processors will be developed.
