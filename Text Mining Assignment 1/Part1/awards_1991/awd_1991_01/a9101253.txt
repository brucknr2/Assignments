Abstract    :
              The Marine Systems Engineering Laboratory of the University                    
              of New Hampshire will conduct a workshop to bring together                     
              scientists involved with the ocean time series investigations                  
              and Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) technologists.  The                    
              goal of the workshop is to explore the possibilities of                        
              improving the effectiveness of repetitive ocean time series                    
              data gathering requirements through the use of AUV                             
              technology.  The workshop will provide the basis for                           
              incorporating ocean science input throughout the AUV                           
              conceptualization and design process.  Time series field                       
              programs provide a useful framework for studying potential                     
              AUV applications in ocean sciences, because there are                          
              specific, well-defined data gathering needs and evaluation                     
              criteria for incorporating these needs into the AUV                            
              development process.  Preliminary information will be                          
              presented at the 7th International Symposium on Unmanned                       
              Untethered Submersible Technology to be held at UNH in                         
              September 1991.
