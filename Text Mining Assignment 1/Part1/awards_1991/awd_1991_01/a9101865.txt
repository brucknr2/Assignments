Abstract    :
                   This CEDAR program is aimed at achieving a better                         
              understanding of the upper atmosphere through studies of the                   
              coupling, energetics, and dynamics of atmospheric regions.  This               
              grant supports instruments upgrade and data analysis from the                  
              University of Michigan optical observatory at Thule Air Force                  
              Base in Greenland in support of the CEDAR program.  The Thule                  
              optical facility is uniquely situated to measure atmospheric                   
              state variables in the deep geomagnetic polar cap with 24-hour a               
              day during the winter by observing season.  Measurements are                   
              made of thermospheric and mesospheric parameters within the polar              
              cap by observing various optical emission features at high                     
              spectral resolution using several optical instruments.  Data from              
              the optical facility at Thule have been used for several CEDAR                 
              programs in the past.  This grant will help assure support to                  
              maintain and augment the scientific capabilities of this unique                
              facility.
