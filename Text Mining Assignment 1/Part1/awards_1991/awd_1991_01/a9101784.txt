Abstract    :
              Studies of the hydrogeochemistry of layer 2 of the oceanic crust               
              are of primary importance for gaining a more thorough                          
              understanding of alteration reactions occurring in the crust and               
              geochemical fluxes associated with exchange between the ocean and              
              layer 2. In both cases the composition of the fluids trapped in                
              layer 2 as formation waters is critical to modelling and flux                  
              calculations. Ocean drilling allows such fluids to be directly                 
              sampled. Unfortunately, the drilling process often disturbs the                
              fluids in a hole requiring a sampling plan that involves a return              
              to the site after the fluids have come to equilibrium. Although                
              such return visits have been done by the drillship itself, other               
              techniques are being perfected to allow return sampling by                     
              submersible (France) and by regular research vessels (United                   
              States).                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The present award will continue support to Dr. Gieskes for such                
              studies. He has recently participated with the French in a re-                 
              entry program in the Atlantic. Funds in the this award will                    
              support analyses and publication of the results from this cruise.              
              Additionally, he will undertake the design of a new sampler to be              
              deployed in drillholes from a re-entry vehicle under construction              
              at Scripps Institution. This system will deploy the samplers                   
              from a vehicle navigated on a cable from a surface vessel,                     
              eliminating the need for a costly submersible or drillship.
