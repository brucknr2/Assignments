Abstract    :
                   This project concerns the ring of invariants of a set of                  
              generic nxn matrices over a field K, and the trace ring, which is              
              the noncommutative ring generated by the ring of invariants and the            
              generic matrices.  The fundamental problem is to find presentations            
              for these algebras, which would solve various explicit                         
              combinatorial problems.  These combinatorial problems have interest            
              in their own right, and currently seem more likely to be solved                
              than the general problem of finding presentations.  Other questions            
              to be considered are whether the quotient field of C(n,r) is purely            
              transcendental over K and what is the structure of the variety of              
              representations of a group G in the trace ring.                                
                   The research supported concerns matrix theory, ring theory and            
              the calculation of invariants.  In particular, this involves an old            
              problem of determining what mathematical functions are preserved               
              under various transformations.  This is of interest in many areas              
              of science as well as in mathematics.
