Abstract    :
                   Professor Berkson will apply abstract operator theory and                 
              harmonic analysis to a broad range of topics in modern analysis.               
              In recent years Professor Berkson's efforts have been directed at              
              developing an abstract Banach space operator theory which                      
              incorporates and expands the transference methods of Coifman and               
              Weiss.  These efforts have now reached fruition, providing a                   
              unified and simplifying overview of the role of harmonic analysis              
              in many aspects of general analysis.  The present program will                 
              apply this overview to applications of central themes in analysis.             
              The focus will be ergodic theory and its generalizations, as well              
              as on classical and abstract harmonic analysis.  The consequences              
              for spectral theory and harmonic analysis in special spaces will be            
              investigated.                                                                  
                   Professor Berkson's work has been in abstract operator theory.            
              (Harmonic analysis can be considered a study of special classes of             
              operators.)  In the present project he will turn his attention to              
              more applied topics to see how successfully the abstract ideas can             
              be used in areas such as ergodic theory, classical analysis, and               
              spectral theory.
