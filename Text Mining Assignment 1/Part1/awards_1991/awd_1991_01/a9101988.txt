Abstract    :
              This proposed study will the vertical accretion of tidal flats off             
              western South Korea, which may provide an excellent analog for                 
              ancient mudflat sequences in the PreCambrian and lower Paleozoic.              
              The field program, involving both current meter and coring                     
              operations, will focus on the following objectives:  1) test the               
              hypothesis that long-term tidal channel stability is controlled by             
              tidal-cycle and season time-scale transport processes in the bottom            
              boundary layer; 2) document the net flux of sediment between the               
              tidal channel systems and adjacent mudflats; 3) determine the                  
              relationship between physical processes and the resultant lithology            
              and structure preserved in the sediment column.
