Abstract    :
              This instrument will be used for the synthesis of DNA                          
              oligonucleotides ranging in size from 15 to 30 bp.  These                      
              oligonucleotides will be used for the following purposes:  1) as               
              specific DNA  primers for dideoxy sequencing, 2) as primers for                
              PCR (polymerase chain reaction) applications, and 3) as primers                
              used in the technique of site-directed mutagenesis.  All three of              
              these procedures require oligonucleotides of specific sequence,                
              which will be used in these research projects:  1)                             
              characterization of a morine MHC hotspot of recombination, 2)                  
              molecular characterization of bacterial luciferase, and 3)                     
              molecular characterization of a new family of retroviral                       
              sequencer in the mouse.
