Abstract    :
                   Integer and mixed-integer programs arise in a wealth of                   
              applications ranging from logistics to very large scaled                       
              integration design.  Recent cutting plane techniques have proven               
              remarkably successful in the solution of integer programs.                     
              Unfortunately, cutting plane techniques have not been applied with             
              the same frequency or success to mixed-integer programs.  The goal             
              of this research is to develop the theory surrounding this                     
              technique as it relates to mixed-integer programming and to                    
              implement algorithms that generate cutting planes for mixed-integer            
              programs.  Ultimately, the goal is to solve large mixed-integer                
              programs using these algorithms.  Applications of mixed-integer                
              programming are so extensive that advances in techniques for their             
              solution will have far reaching consequences extending across many             
              disciplines.  Additional objectives include establishing a public              
              domain library of mixed-integer programs and providing developed               
              algorithms to researchers.
