Abstract    :
              Research is planned in algorithmic algebraic geometry and its                  
              applications to geometric modeling, symbolic computations over                 
              finite fields, and computational group theory, with special                    
              emphasis on the following topics:                                              
                                                                                             
              1. Unambiguous Solid Model Representations                                     
              2. Robust Surface Intersections                                                
              3. Implicitization and Parameterization                                        
              4. Multi-polynomial Resultants                                                 
              5. Resolution of Singularities in Characteristic p                             
              6. Galois Groups of Algebraic Curves                                           
                                                                                             
              Algebraic Geometry is a venerable, deep discipline in pure                     
              mathematics, involving symbolic abstractions of geometric                      
              objects.  This is an area that is currently seeing diverse and                 
              exciting applications.
