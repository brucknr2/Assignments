Abstract    :
              This Career Advancement project will focus on a relatively new                 
              area of research for Dr. Catherine McNeal.  Preliminary studies                
              have established that Californium-252-plasma desorption mass                   
              spectrometry (Cf-252 PDMS)is a valuable experimental method to                 
              characterize large metal clusters.  A variety of large anionic                 
              platinum carbonyl clusters and cationic gold and mixed metal                   
              gold and gold supraclusters have been investigated by this                     
              experimental approach.  This project will focus on the                         
              development of Cf-252 PDMS as a reliable and accurate method to                
              characterize large metal clusters and to use this approach to                  
              unambiguously characterize intermediates and products in novel                 
              inorganic syntheses.  The first step will be to prove that the                 
              Cf-252 PDMS spectrum is an accurate representation of solution                 
              and sample composition for a variety of clusters.  Oligomers                   
              containing as many as 20 units and over 500 platinum atoms have                
              been detected, and the origin of such clusters will be                         
              determined.  These clusters exhibit redox behaviour on exposure                
              to silica.  Cf-252 PDMS will be used to determine whether these                
              processes involve changes in cluster nuclearity or cluster                     
              charge.  An understanding of fragmentation patterns is                         
              essential in order to distinguisn fragment ions from sample                    
              components.  This project will provide an unambiguous                          
              measurement of the stoichiometry of large supraclusters from                   
              studies on smaller clusters of known composition and structure.

              This Career Advancement Award will support activities that will                
              enhance Dr. Catherine McNeal's research career potential.  New                 
              skills which are crucial to the change in direction of her                     
              research activities will be developed.  Furthermore, this                      
              project is strongly interactive with the research of other                     
              investigators who will benefit from the results as well.
