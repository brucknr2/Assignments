Abstract    :
                   Light front meson exchange models for the two-nucleon                     
              system which involve interacting spin operators will be                        
              analyzed.  The Lee model will be extended to provide a                         
              Poincare' invariant model for the pion-nucleon system and used                 
              to assess the validity of the constituent quark model.  A                      
              light front reformulation of a covariant harmonic oscillator                   
              will be extended to systems of spin-1/2 particles and used to                  
              study the relationships between various relativistic and non-                  
              relativistic hadron quark models.  Electromagnetic currents                    
              described by covariant constraint dynamics will be used to                     
              calculate form factors and structure functions for two and                     
              three quark systems.
