Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                 
              Program of the Chemistry division, Professor Coalson will                      
              develop wavepacket methods for computing the dynamical                         
              evolution of quantum many-body systems and will apply these                    
              methods to several problems in condensed phase spectroscopy.                   
              The computations will aid in the understanding of rate                         
              processes in these systems which explicitly depend on quantum                  
              effects.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The problems to be investigated will include: photodesorption                  
              cross sections of molecular adsorbates (e.g., CH3Br and NO),                   
              and resonance raman excitation profiles of the bovine                          
              pancreatic tripsin inhibitor protein. The principle technique                  
              to be employed is the time-dependent Hartree grid method which                 
              involves factorization of the complete many-body system wave                   
              function into low dimensional pieces for various subsystems.                   
              This approximation is suitable for treating subpicosecond                      
              dynamics as required in the above applications. In order to                    
              treat longer time processes, accuracy beyond the Hartee level                  
              will be necessary. The principal investigator will develop                     
              algorithms to do configuration interaction in conjunction with                 
              the time-dependent Hartee grid solutions. These algorithms will                
              introduce direct correlation between wavepackets representing                  
              the various subsystems into which the overall system has been                  
              partitioned.
