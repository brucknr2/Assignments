Abstract    :
                   This award is for a series of three workshops in                          
              Geometric Topology to be held in 1991, 1992 and 1993.  The                     
              workshops will be advertised nationally, and support will be                   
              extended primarily to active research mathematicians without other             
              NSF support and to graduate students.  Most of the participants are            
              expected to come from the Midwest and Western United States.  One              
              goal of these workshops is to provide participants an opportunity              
              to discuss their work with others in the field.  Another goal is to            
              expand the interests of the participants by having a nationally                
              recognized expert discuss an area of topology which is related to              
              but outside the focus of their current work.  The first workshop               
              will be held during a four day period at the University of                     
              Wisconsin-Milwaukee in June 1991.  Andrew Casson of the University             
              of California at Berkeley has agreed to be the principal speaker at            
              this workshop.  Similar four day workshops will be held in the                 
              summers of 1992 and 1993 at Colorado College and at Oregon State               
              University.
