Abstract    :
              With the increases in microprocessor performance and memory capacity           
              that have occurred during the past five years, one of the major                
              difference between high performance supercomputers and the "killer             
              micros" is I/O performance.  The primary objective of this                     
              investigation is to increase the performance of the I/O subsystem by           
              increasing disk cache performance.                                             
                                                                                             
              The first task considered is to characterize the load presented to a           
              disk controller by analyzing I/O performance.  The traces will be              
              collected by instrumenting the device driver for the disk controller.          
              Trace entries will be timestamped so a dynamic view of the system load         
              can be obtained.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The second task in the investigation is to use trace-driven simulation         
              to investigate the performance of various disk cache architectures.  A         
              major goal of this task is to find ways of exploiting the position             
              dependent nature of disk access latency.  Thus, the project will focus         
              on using cache policies that utilize knowledge of the disk's state.
