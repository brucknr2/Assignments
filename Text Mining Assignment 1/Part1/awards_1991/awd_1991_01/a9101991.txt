Abstract    :
              Snyder         The goals of this research are the development of:  1.    
              improved image restoration algorithms for dealing with  stochastic inverse
              problems;  2.     methods for assessing the quality of the images which are 
              produced; and  3.     strategies for parallel implementation of the resulting 
              algorithms.         The primary focus is on quantum-limited data which arises
              in  such diverse applications as imaging faint objects in outer space  and
              imaging radioactivity concentrations within human tissue.
