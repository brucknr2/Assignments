Abstract    :
              A comprehensive experimental study is being proposed to perform                
              dynamic characterization of monolithic and reinforced (fiber and               
              particle) polymeric materials using attached and embedded optical-             
              fiber sensors.  This study will provide better understanding of the            
              high strain rate behavior of these materials and at the same time              
              evaluate the performance of embedded optical fiver sensors which               
              is a key ingredient of "smart materials."  Results from fundamental            
              studies will be relevant to the detection of acoustic emission from            
              internal strains and propagating cracks.  Also, dynamic fracture               
              studies will be conducted with the fiber sensors being attached and            
              embedded in monolithic and reinforced polymeric materials, from                
              which the instantaneous dynamic stress intensity factor will be                
              determined.  These experiments will provide the complete dynamic               
              strain field history as the crack initiates, propagates and arrests            
              in these materials.
