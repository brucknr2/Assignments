Abstract    :
              In Phase I, a new process for control of the emissions of                      
              submicron particles, sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides                   
              (NOx) from combustion of coal has been demonstrated on the                     
              laboratory scale.  Sox and Nox are controlled with an                          
              effectiveness comparable to wet limestone scrubbing and                        
              selective catalytic reduction, the best presently available                    
              control technologies.  A preliminary estimate indicates that                   
              the cost of controlling submicron particles, SOx and Nox via                   
              the new process will be less than the cost of controlling SOx                  
              and Nox via the best of presently available technologies, and                  
              with a cost which is lower than wet limestone scrubbing and                    
              selective catalytic reduction.                                                 
              In Phase II it is proposed to demonstrate this new pollution                   
              control process on a pilot plant scale for a coal burning                      
              combustion system, show that it can operate in a satisfactory                  
              manner, and develop a more detailed analysis of process                        
              economics.
