Abstract    :
                   This project involves further investigation in the area of                
              generation of test cases for NP-hard problems.  This area has to do            
              with the design of efficient algorithms to produce instances of NP-            
              hard problems with known answers, in such a way that the sets of               
              instances produced are useful for the empirical testing of                     
              approximation algorithms for these problems.                                   
                   Previous work consisted of theoretical results concerning the             
              existence of different types of test case generators, and the design           
              of test case construction algorithms for certain NP-hard graph                 
              problems.  For the proposed research the overall goals are to improve          
              on the generation procedures, to expand their applicability, and to            
              gain more insight into the relationship between the instances                  
              generated by the procedures and the problem or application instances.          
              The project will include consideration of construction algorithms for          
              problems in different application areas; and the investigation,                
              through both analytical and empirical means, of the effect of well-            
              known approximation algorithms on sets of generated instances.
