Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplementary support to                               
              enable Dr. Greg Swain of Auburn University to conduct                          
              collaborative research with Dr. Kingo Itaya for twelve                         
              months at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.  They                            
              will apply in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)                         
              and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques to                                
              characterize the solid/solution interface of gold and                          
              carbon fiber electrode surfaces.                                               
                                                                                             
              Despite the fact that they are strongly influenced by                          
              the microstructure present at the surface, solid                               
              electrodes are usually studied in a high vacuum.  Such                         
              a technique does not accurately measure the physical                           
              and chemical interface properties of the solid                                 
              electrode surfaces in solutions as they relate to                              
              electron transfer, adsorption, corrosion and                                   
              catalysis.  In order to provide insight into the                               
              nature of these processes, Swain and Itaya will                                
              conduct an in situ analysis of single crystal gold                             
              electrodes in ultraclean solutions using STM and AFM.                          
              Dr. Itaya's expertise in the use of in situ STM to                             
              image mono and polycrystalline electrode surfaces will                         
              complement Swain's experience in electrochemical                               
              surface spectroscopy and the necessary pretreatment of                         
              carbonaceous electrodes, and will facilitate the                               
              understanding of the interaction between ions and                              
              solvents at the solid/solution interface.
