Abstract    :
              This award supports a systematic 40Ar/39Ar dating project                      
              which has been coordinated with field mapping and petrologic                   
              studies by geologists of the Greenland Survey working in the                   
              East Greenland Caledonides.  East Greenland occupies a                         
              critical position in circum-Atlantic correlations; however,                    
              it is probably the least known and most poorly understood                      
              component of the Caledonian-Appalachian orogen.  Recent work                   
              has demonstrated that the orogen records a complex,                            
              tectonothermal evolution.  However, the available                              
              geochronologic database is inadequate to precisely calibrate                   
              the various discrete Precambrian and Paleozoic events which                    
              are indicated by both field and petrologic relationships.                      
              This research would provide a systematic network of                            
              40Ar/39Ar mineral age determinations in areas recently                         
              mapped.  The close control on field relationships in these                     
              areas will enable the geochronological results to be used to                   
              constrain the thermal evolution in the central East                            
              Greenland Caledonides.
