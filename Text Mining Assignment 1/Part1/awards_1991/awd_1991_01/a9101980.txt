Abstract    :
              The goal of this software capitalization project is the development            
              and distribution of a "release" quality version of STR+VE, a theorem           
              prover for the first-order predicate calculus with inequality.  This           
              prover employs the Shielding Term Removal and Variable Elimination             
              strategy with its emphasis on "larger steps".  It is a fully automatic         
              prover which has proved several important results in analysis, for             
              example, the theorem that the sum of continuous functions is                   
              continuous.
