Abstract    :
                   A research program in electromagnetic studies of few body                 
              systems will be carried out at Bates, SLAC, and CEBAF.                         
              Specifically, electron-proton coincidence reactions will be                    
              used to probe nucleon momentum distributions and short range                   
              2-nucleon correlations.  Development work will be carried out                  
              on high power cryogenic gas targets needed for the groups                      
              research program.  M.S. level graduate students and                            
              undergraduate students will be involved in this research                       
              program.
