Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project examines the synthesis and characterization of new                 
              polymers to be used for membranes with improved                                
              characteristics for oxygen separation from air.  Polymers and                  
              copolymers are synthesized with main-chain Schiff-base/Co(II)                  
              coordination.  The polymers are modified to improve their                      
              long-term stability to oxygen complexation.  the objectives                    
              are to study the relation between polymer structure and oxygen                 
              binding parameters.  Membranes formed from these polymers are                  
              studied with respect to their permeability to O2  and N2.  UV-                 
              Visible spectrophotometry is used to identify complexes with                   
              oxygen.  Pulsed-laser flash photolysis is used to determine                    
              complexation rate constants.  The results should have an                       
              impact on synthesizing novel polymeric materials for membrane-                 
              gas-separations and possibly other applications.
