Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue her study of the                 
              Laplace-Beltrami operator on compact Riemannian manifolds. She will            
              try to determine the extent to which the spectrum of the Laplacian             
              determines the geometry of the manifold. One goal of the research              
              is to study examples of isospectral manifolds and identify                     
              geometric invariants which are not determined by the spectra. In               
              addition she will try to identify other natural operators whose                
              spectra might distinguish the metrics.                                         
                   Two manifolds or surfaces are said to be isospectral if the               
              corresponding eigenvalues of the Laplacians on the manifolds are               
              equal. If one thought of the two surfaces as surfaces of drums this            
              would mean that the two drums would sound the same when struck. The            
              principal investigator will study situations in which the two                  
              surfaces "sound the same" but have different shapes.
