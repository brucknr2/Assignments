Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the continued study of the physics of Na              
              temperature lidar and its applications.  It is expected that with              
              improved technology the temperature error due to laser frequency               
              uncertainty can be reduced to the level of 0.1 K, and that the                 
              lidar can also be used to measure radial wind velocity to an                   
              accuracy of 1 m/s.  Since very little is known about the                       
              temperature structure in the mesopause region, measurements of                 
              temperature and Doppler-wind) profiles with high resolution are                
              timely and of geophysical interest.  A three year-research                     
              program will be carried out to further investigate and employ the              
              physics of high-spectral-resolution Na fluorescence lidar, and to              
              elucidate the geophysics in the mesospause region by performing                
              observations regularly and over an extended period with this                   
              unique lidar system.  In particular, the PI will (1) conduct                   
              laboratory and theoretical studies of saturated Doppler-free                   
              fluorescence spectroscopy in Na vapor for the purpose of                       
              improving measurement accuracy, (2) modify the existing lidar for              
              simultaneous temperature and Doppler-wind measurements, (3)                    
              establish nighttime climatology of the mesopause region over Fort              
              Collins, CO and (4) analyze, organize and interpret these unique               
              lidar data in terms of correlated mesospheric response to gravity              
              wave induced perturbations.  ***
