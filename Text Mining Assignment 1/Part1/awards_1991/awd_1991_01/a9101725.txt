Abstract    :
                   The analysis or reconstructions of rotations can be                       
              accomplished from data gathered from a spherical surface or from               
              three-dimensional space.  These problems arise in determining an               
              unknown coordinate system, such as the orientation of a satellite              
              or the crystallographic axes of a crystal, and in reconstructing               
              the past position of tectonic plates.  This research will develop              
              statistical techniques for these problems that are not overly                  
              sensitive to outliers and will examine the statistical properties              
              for inferences drawn by these methods.  Applications to                        
              Procrustes analysis will be emphasized for the study of tectonic               
              plate reconstructions.
