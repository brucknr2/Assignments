Abstract    :
                   Professor Talagrand's research will be in three main areas.               
              He will study lower bounds for Bernoulli processes with a view to              
              proving a conjecture involving a norm incorporating the geometry of            
              two Banach spaces.  He will continue his research in isoperimetric             
              inequalities.  He will study the notion of type and cotype in                  
              Banach spaces.                                                                 
                   This research is at the interface of two fields: probability              
              theory and the geometry of infinite dimensional spaces (Banach                 
              spaces).  Probabilistic ideas are useful in understanding Banach               
              spaces and conversely the quest to understand these spaces leads to            
              new and interesting questions in pure probability.
