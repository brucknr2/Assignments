Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this proposal is to begin to determine                
              the degree of intra-specific variability in the social behavior                
              of the black lemur (Lemur macaco macaco) of northwestern                       
              Madagascar.   There is some information on the behavioral                      
              characteristics of this species.  Yet, it is well known from                   
              studies of other nonhuman primates that great variability may be               
              encountered between conspecific populations due to ecological and              
              other causes.  The PIs will begin to assess the level of                       
              behavioral variability by observing four groups over the course                
              of eighteen months.  As two of the populations reside in                       
              relatively undisturbed areas and two in areas significantly                    
              disrupted by human activity, there will be ample opportunity to                
              observe the range of black lemur behavior.                                     
                                                                                             
              The project will aim to document the responses to habitat                      
              disturbance.  Most specifically, disturbance leads to an altered               
              distribution of food sources,  which in turn may affect ranging                
              patterns and male migrations between groups.  The latter will                  
              also be documented in reference to mating patterns.  As female                 
              lemurs dominate males, the effects of migration on female choice               
              of mates and other aspects of mating strategies will be of                     
              interest.
