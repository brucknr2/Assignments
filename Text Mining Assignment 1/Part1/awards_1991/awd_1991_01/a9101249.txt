Abstract    :
              This program addresses the challenge of increasing the enrollment              
              of women and minorities in graduate engineering study.  The key                
              aspects of this program are: 1) the active recruitment of                      
              minorities and women by visiting selected "target" schools, and 2)             
              a student oriented research program that contains social as well               
              as instructional aspects designed for successful integration of the            
              participants into an exciting research environment.  Ten faculty               
              members from the Department of Chemical Engineering at Penn State              
              have volunteered to support recruitment, instruction, and research             
              supervision.  The projects offered span a wide range of research,              
              from plant tissue culture, to thermodynamics - held together by                
              common chemical engineering principles.  REU participants are                  
              matched with projects prior to selection to maximize mutual                    
              interests and capabilities.  The participants enroll for 3 credits             
              of Chemical Engineering Undergraduate Research during the summer               
              semester.  An instructional program at the beginning of the program            
              has been designed to give the students a quick start on research.              
              To stress the importance of communication, an introductory and                 
              final oral presentation, as well as a final written report is                  
              required of each student.
