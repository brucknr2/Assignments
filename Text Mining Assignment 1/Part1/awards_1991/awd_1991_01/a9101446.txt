Abstract    :
                   This project will consider spiky behavior of the least                    
              energy solution of a semilinear problem in pattern formation,                  
              classification of solutions of the conformal curvature equations,              
              symmetry of positive solutions of semilinear elliptic equations,               
              and stability of steady states for a class of semilinear heat                  
              equations.                                                                     
                   The problems to be addressed are state of the art                         
              mathematical questions motivated by problems in a wide range of                
              scientific areas including differential geometry, developmental                
              biology, and astronomy.
