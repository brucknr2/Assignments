Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will continue his              
              research on the asymptotic behavior of orthogonal polynomials and              
              their zeros with respect to general weights with compact support               
              in the plane.  He will also explore the possibility of using                   
              potential theory to study orthogonal polynomials in collaboration              
              with faculty members at the University of South Florida.  Finally              
              the principal investigator will study asymptotic questions                     
              related to the support of the Christoffel function under fairly                
              general assumptions.                                                           
                   The study of the properties of orthogonal polynomials is                  
              important in its own right and for the light it sheds on various               
              problems in approximation theory, numerical analysis and                       
              differential equations.  In this project the principal                         
              investigator, in collaboration with experts at the University of               
              South Florida, will continue his valuable work on the asymptotic               
              properties of orthogonal polynomials under general conditions                  
              through the use of potential theory.
