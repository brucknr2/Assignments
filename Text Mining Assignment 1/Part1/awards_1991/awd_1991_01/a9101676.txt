Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with a study of the optical properties              
              of as-grown and artificially-structured high-temperature                       
              superconductors over the far-infrared through ultraviolet                      
              wavelength range.  The role of the superconducting layer thickness             
              and of interlayer coupling will be studied through measurements of             
              yttrium-barium-cuprate/praseodymium-barium-cuprate multilayer                  
              systems.  Measurements of a wide variety of other high temperature             
              superconductor materials will address issues such as the                       
              superconducting energy gap and the nature of the non-Drude                     
              absorption that occurs in the midinfrared range.  The project                  
              represents a collaboration between the University of Florida, where            
              most of the infrared measurements will be made, and Bell                       
              Communications Research, where much of the sample preparation will             
              be carried out.
