Abstract    :
                   This project will deal with inverse problems arising in                   
              image reconstruction.  Attenuation and scattering of low energy                
              probes by unknown media, soliton theory applied to slice                       
              selection in magnetic resonance imaging, and application of group              
              representation to signal processing will be considered.  In                    
              addition, considerable effort will be placed in further                        
              developing a technique introduced by the PI to obtain rank two                 
              solutions to certain partial differential equations.  This                     
              technique avoids using complicated algebraic geometry methods.                 
                   This project has been motivated by problems arising in                    
              imaging reconstruction processes such as X rays and magnetic                   
              resonance.  The mathematics to be developed has direct                         
              implications in the construction of algorithms and devices used                
              in medical imaging.
