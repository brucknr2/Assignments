Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Based on recent data collected on the continental shelf near                   
              Delaware Bay, development of process models to understand the                  
              interaction between large weakly-stratified estuaries and the                  
              adjacent shelf is proposed.  Research will focus on the mean                   
              structure of currents that result from coupling, the variations                
              caused by wind stress, variable buoyancy, and current                          
              instability, and interaction between the mean and tidal currents.
