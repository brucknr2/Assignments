Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation improvement proposal supports the collection                 
              and analysis of data from scientists who participate in social                 
              movements.  The research extends and tests a theory of invol-                  
              vement which predicts that an individual's social power and                    
              network ties to others are major determinants of participation.                
              Scientists are an appropriate group for such a study, because                  
              unlike participants in many social movements, scientists enjoy a               
              relatively privileged and powerful position in society.
