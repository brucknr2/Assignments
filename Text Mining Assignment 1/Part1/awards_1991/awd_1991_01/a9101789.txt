Abstract    :
                   This project provides funds to support participation of                   
              scientists from U.S. research institutions in the XVIIth                       
              International Conference on the Physics of Electronic and Atomic               
              Collisions (ICPEAC) to be held in Brisbane, Australia, July 10-                
              16, 1991.  Applications for support are solicited and evaluated                
              by a committee composed of U.S. members of the ICPEAC General                  
              Committee.  Particular attention is given to applications from                 
              students and from scientists who do not have major research                    
              support from which they could obtain the necessary travel funds.               
              This biennial conference deals with two-body interactions between              
              ions, atoms, molecules, electrons, positrons and photons, and                  
              with interaction energies ranging from subthermal to millions of               
              electron volts.  The subject matter relates both to fundamental                
              physics, and to technologically significant issues.
