Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     Theis is a theoretical study of the dynamics of hydrothermal           
              processes beneath ridge.crest thermal areas. A theoretical analog              
              of the natural system has been designed to facilitate analyses of              
              the interaction among processes that redistribute energy and mass              
              from the pluton sized magma bodies near the bottom of the ocean                
              crust through percolation networks in the overlying rocks. The                 
              objective of the study is to predict the magnitude and                         
              periodicity of long and short term variations of field parameters              
              in the subsurface beneath active hot springs that are caused by                
              local feedbacks amongst the transport processes. The study will                
              focus primarily on the behavior of hydrothermal activity at state              
              conditions that coincide with the near field of the critical                   
              region of the fluid.
