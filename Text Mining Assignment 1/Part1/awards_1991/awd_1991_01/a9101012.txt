Abstract    :
              Under this collaborative project between Thomas Carleson,                      
              University of Idaho, and Xiao Jim, South China University of                   
              Technology, the corrosion inhibiting properties of materials                   
              derived from plants which are indigenous only in Asia will be                  
              investigated.  The materials involved have been isolated by                    
              researchers at South China University of Technology, and have                  
              proven to have significant corrosion inhibition properties.                    
              Under this project, characterization of the materials will                     
              occur at the University of Idaho, bringing expertise in                        
              electrochemical engineering and access to characterization                     
              equipment to bear on the question of how these materials                       
              inhibit corrosion.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This collaboration may lead to development of greatly                          
              improved corrosion inhibition agents from natural materials,                   
              replacing more costly materials derived from petroleum.  This                  
              project is supported under the U.S.-China Cooperative Science                  
              Program.
