Abstract    :
                   This research concentrates on algebraic aspects of dimension              
              theory.  The crucial part of the project is to decide whether cell-            
              like images of euclidean 4-space are finite-dimensional.  Proving              
              (or disproving) results in cohomological dimension theory which are            
              analogous to results in covering dimension theory is another goal              
              of the project.                                                                
                   The answers are known to the analogues of the key question for            
              Euclidean spaces of dimensions other than 4.  This is another case             
              where the difficulty of a topological question does not increase               
              with dimension.  It is distressing to find that the greatest                   
              mysteries concern the space of three dimensions in which we live or            
              the space of four dimensions, which may be viewed as space-time.
