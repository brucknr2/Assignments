Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research effort will develop a                                            
              state-of-practice knowledge base on effective                                  
              seismic design of buildings specifically                                       
              directed at an audience of practicing                                          
              architects and faculty in university-based                                     
              schools of architecture. Although a great                                      
              deal of new information has been generated in                                  
              the subject area over the last decade, it has                                  
              not been systematically developed into a                                       
              comprehensive, up to date, and useful                                          
              information base.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The project will generate this information                                     
              base through an interrelated series of tasks                                   
              which will:

                   state-of-practice data base on the                                        
                   architectural aspects of seismic design,                                  
                   concentrating on information developed                                    
                   over the last 10 years;                                                   
              *    identify gaps within this data base;                                      
              *    conduct research to address those gaps                                    
                   that can be filled within the scope and                                   
                   time frame of the project;                                                
              *    develop recommendations for addressing                                    
                   those topics requiring longer term                                        
                   efforts;                                                                  
              *    develop a series of subject-specific                                      
                   final reports which will constitute the                                   
                   first comprehensive knowledge base on                                     
                   the architectural aspects of seismic                                      
                   design available in over a decade.                                        
                                                                                             
              The information developed by this project                                      
              will constitute a significant addition to the                                  
              knowledge base in the subject area and,                                        
              judging from recent activities within the AIA                                  
              and the profession, will be effectively                                        
              transferable to practicing architects,                                         
              faculty and students.
