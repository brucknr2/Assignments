Abstract    :
              This award supports collaborative research on algebraic                        
              geometry.  Robert Lax of Louisiana State University is an                      
              expert on Weierstrass points on complex Gorenstein curves,                     
              while Arnaldo Garcia of IMPA (Rio de Janeiro) is an expert on                  
              curves in positive characteristic.  The notions of classical and non           
              classical curves will be extended to singular curves.                          
              Questions concerning classicality of curves and normalization                  
              and classicality of curves and degenerations will be                           
              considered.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              On smooth curves in characteristic zero, the investigators                     
              will study possible weights and gap sequences of Weierstrass                   
              points on curves that are two-sheeted covers of other curves.                  
              On smooth curves in positive characteristic, the investigators                 
              will study relation between the defining equation and the                      
              classicality of the curve.  Finally, on curves over finite                     
              fields, the investigators will study relations between the                     
              Weierstrass gap sequence at a point and geometric Goppa codes                  
              defined using a multiple of that point.  The question of the                   
              number of rational points on curves with certain types of                      
              Weierstrass points will also be considered.  While this                        
              research is sure mathematics, there exists the potential for                   
              important application in coding theory due to the connections                  
              with Goppa codes.
