Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to provide a theoretical                     
              and experimental approach to evaluate the dynamic response                     
              of rock bolts to blast loads. The effects of the frequency                     
              and wavelength of excitation and the material properties of                    
              the bolt and its surrounding rock on the dynamic response                      
              of the bolt will be studied to provide better rock                             
              stability in tunnels, underground mines, and man-made                          
              caverns.
