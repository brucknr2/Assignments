Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his study of                     
              submanifolds of the simply connected constant curvature manifolds              
              using the techniques of Lie sphere geometry. In particular he will             
              attempt to give a classification of the taut and Dupin                         
              submanifolds. The investigator will also continue to involve                   
              undergraduate students in his research thus providing them with a              
              solid background for graduate study.                                           
                   The simply connected constant curvature manifolds are                     
              Euclidean space, the sphere, and hyperbolic space. These manifolds             
              are very special and serve as test cases for many questions in                 
              differential geometry. The principal investigator will attempt to              
              classify all submanifolds or surfaces in these manifolds which are             
              taut or rigid.
