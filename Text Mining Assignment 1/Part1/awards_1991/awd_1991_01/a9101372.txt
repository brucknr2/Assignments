Abstract    :
                   Professor Bercovici will study the properties of free additive            
              and multiplicative convolution of measures in the convex plane, as             
              well as applications of these operations to the calculation of                 
              spectral invariants.  He will continue the study of spectral                   
              versions of the Nevanlinna-Pick, Caratheodory, and Nehari problems             
              and explore their relations with control theory.  Another topic of             
              study will be the structure of dual algebras with an emphasis on               
              algebras generated by a finite number of commuting operators.                  
                   Professor Bercovici's research concerns operators on Hilbert              
              space.  Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite matrices              
              of complex numbers.  These operators have applications in every                
              area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics.  Research              
              of this type is an attempt to classify certain important families              
              of such operators.
