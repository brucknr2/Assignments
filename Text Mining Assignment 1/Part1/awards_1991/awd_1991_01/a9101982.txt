Abstract    :
                   This proposal requests funds as part of the CEDAR initiative              
              for capital equipment for Jicamarca Radio Observatory in order to              
              continue the upgrading of the main incoherent scatter radar                    
              transmitter.  Also this proposal requests funding for the parts                
              to finish the work on the third and fourth driver stages for the               
              transmitter and to buy the high power tube for the third final                 
              stage.***//
