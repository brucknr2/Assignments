Abstract    :
                   This workshop will contribute to developments in both                     
              practical and theoretical statistics.  Its contributions to                    
              practice will be dissemination of experience in applying Bayesian              
              methods and the identification of specific theoretical and                     
              implementation tools that can aid in the convenient, routine use of            
              Bayesian methods.  It will contribute to theory by providing a                 
              collection of concrete, contextually grounded research problems in             
              the light of which actual and potential theoretical developments               
              can be examined.                                                               
                   The workshop will be held in September, 1991 at Carnegie-                 
              Mellon University.  It will include those who use and develop                  
              statistical theory and methods, and several applications will be               
              presented in length, with a thematic focus on the contribution of              
              the Bayesian theory of statistics.  This conference has the                    
              potential for great impact in the field of statistics.  Bringing               
              together good statistical theory and computing power to solve a                
              real problem is the direction of future research.
