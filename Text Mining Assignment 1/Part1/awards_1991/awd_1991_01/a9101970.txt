Abstract    :
              This award supports cooperative research in geology to                         
              be conducted by Dr. Stephen Marshak of the University                          
              of Illinois, Urbana, Dr. Hannes Brueckner of the                               
              Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory and Drs.                                 
              Fernando Alkmim, Hanna Jordt Evangelista and Farid                             
              Chemale, Jr. from the Universidade Federal de Ouro                             
              Preto (UFOP), Brazil.  The objective of the project is                         
              to work out the detailed tectonic history of the                               
              eastern margin of the Sao Francisco craton. One, and                           
              possibly two, detailed transects of this margin will                           
              incorporate new field studies of structural geology                            
              and petrology, new advanced geochronological analysis,                         
              and a synthesis of existing, but largely unavailable,                          
              local studies in the region.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The results of the project will define the geometry,                           
              style and age of the Brasiliano tectonism west of the                          
              coastal mobile belt; the nature of the basins in which                         
              Late Proterozoic strata were deposited; and the age                            
              and style of pre-Brasiliano orogenies.  The award will                         
              foster continuation of a productive U.S.-Brazil                                
              collaboration.
