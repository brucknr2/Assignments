Abstract    :
              This award provides travel grants for Americans to attend a workshop           
              on Operating Systems for the 90's and Beyond to be held in Germany.            
              An organizing group from the U.S. and Europe has set a list of topics,         
              selected key presenters, arranged funding for travel and lodging in            
              Europe, and arranged for sponsorship by several professional societies         
              and industrial concerns.  The Proceedings will be published.
