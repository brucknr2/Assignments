Abstract    :
                   The investigators will develop algorithms for stowing cargo               
              on movement-and-storage devices such as airplanes, trucks, ships,              
              shelves, and pallets so that the load is safely balanced and                   
              stable.  Such problems have this general form:  Given a structure              
              and a set of forces and moments, where should those forces and                 
              moments be applied to the structure?  This complements the                     
              traditional design questions of mechanical engineering:  Given a               
              set of worst-case forces and moments, design a structure to bear               
              them.  The investigators have coined the term "combinatorial                   
              mechanics"  to describe the issues to be studied.  The problems                
              involve mechanics because of the concern for the center-of-gravity,            
              deformation, natural frequency, and so on.  The problems are                   
              combinatorial because the forces generally arise from the weight               
              of items to be stored, and so the resultant forces on the structure            
              depend on how the items are arranged.                                          
                   The approach to this research represents an innovative                    
              departure from traditional load planning approaches.  The                      
              development of a field of combinatorial mechanics could open the               
              door to novel interpretations of logistics problems of this nature.
