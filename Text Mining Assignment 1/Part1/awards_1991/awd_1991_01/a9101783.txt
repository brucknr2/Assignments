Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     Seafloor topography has a major effect on magnetotelluric              
              sounding and magnetovariational profiling.  This project will                  
              conduct an experimental design program using a variety of two and              
              three dimensional modeling methods to quantify the effects of                  
              bathymetry and three.dimensional seafloor sturcture on natural                 
              source.field soundings.
