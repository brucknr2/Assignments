Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Pyrenomycetous ascomycetes have been the subject of numerous                   
              studies that have produced phylogenetic hypotheses that remain                 
              untested.  The stumbling block has been a paucity of diagnostic                
              characters above the ordinal level.  It is the goal of this                    
              project to infer relationships, i.e., natural groupings, among                 
              and within orders of fungi that traditionally have been grouped                
              as pyrenomycetes.  This phylogeny will be based upon the                       
              nucleotide sequences of both nuclear coding regions (SSU rDNA and              
              vATPase).  Congruency between the two data sets will be strong                 
              support for the relationships in question, whereas incongruencies              
              will question such relationships.  The resulting phylogeny will                
              be compared to those of previous studies that have employed                    
              characters from morphology, ultrastructure and cell biology.  By               
              using two independent molecular data sets we will be able to                   
              discern between the gene phylogenies and the species phylogeny.
