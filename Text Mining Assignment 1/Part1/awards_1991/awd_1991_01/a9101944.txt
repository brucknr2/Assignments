Abstract    :
              This is a travel award for exploratory visits to three institutions            
              to visit faculty and examine facilities.  These visits are to                  
              identify the best match of interests and appropriateness of                    
              laboratory facilities and library holdings in preparation for a                
              postdoctoral study program.  Initial contacts have been made with              
              faculty at each of the scheduled institutions, who have expressed              
              an interest in serving as postdoctoral mentor.  This travel award              
              will enable the investigator to meet with other members of the                 
              various appropriate departments and make a choice of the program               
              best suited to his goals.  Initial discussions of possible                     
              arrangements for a postdoctoral appointment will also be held.
