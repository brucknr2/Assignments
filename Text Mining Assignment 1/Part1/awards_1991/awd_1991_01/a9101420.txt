Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site grant.                  
              The award permits undergraduate students to participate in a                   
              research program in the materials field under the supervision of               
              faculty members actively engaged in research.  Eight                           
              undergraduate students are being recruited from physics                        
              departments in the Southwest United States, with at least three                
              of the openings being reserved for qualified women, handicapped,               
              and minority students.  Students will participate in a summer                  
              program that involves them in research associated with a faculty               
              member on laser-host materials, electro-optic, photorefractive                 
              and colloidal materials with potential for application in optical              
              systems.  The nine areas of this research include crystal growth,              
              time-resolved site-selection spectroscopy, optical instabilities,              
              optical characterization of quantum wells and superlattices,                   
              characterization of defect states in compound semiconductors,                  
              thermal transport in optical materials, complex fluids, and                    
              colloidal physics and optical filters.  Students will present the              
              results of their research in university seminars and at national               
              professional society meetings.  The program enhances current                   
              research activities as well as adding to the number of                         
              scientifically trained individuals.  It is hoped that this hands-              
              on experience will serve as a stimulus to attract and retain                   
              highly-gifted students into careers in teaching and research.
