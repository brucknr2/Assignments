Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Center for Neurosciences and the              
              Department of Zoology at the University of Maryland College Park               
              (UMCP) to establish an REU Site Program to help develop                        
              undergraduate interest in biological research.  The program will               
              place emphasis on research in Neurobiology and Behavior and                    
              primarily involve students from the UMCP and its sister-campus,                
              the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES), a historically                
              black campus of the University of Maryland.  Student research                  
              will be conducted at UMCP.  The program will place great effort                
              on recruiting and training minorities and women, not only from                 
              UMCP and UMES, but also from other campuses of the University of               
              Maryland System with high minority enrollments.  The REU program               
              will introduce students to basic research by giving them the                   
              opportunity to work in active and productive research                          
              laboratories.  A major objective of the program is to provide                  
              students with a broader research/training experience than is                   
              typical with an individual student working in a research                       
              laboratory.  Taking advantage of the large number of active                    
              research programs in neurobiology and behavior at UMCP, students               
              will have substantial opportunities to interact with all of the                
              faculty in the program in lectures, demonstrations, and field                  
              trips.  Students will benefit immensely by interacting among                   
              themselves and this will be developed through a bi-weekly                      
              student-led seminar, facilitated by a faculty member, but run by               
              students.
