Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              General Motors Engineering and Management Institute is                         
              establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second               
              line through the MICHNET state network.  The connection enhances               
              collaborations of campus scientists with colleagues at other                   
              institutions, and allows access to libraries and other remote                  
              facilities throughout the internet.  This award funds part of the              
              costs for installation of the connection and operation for the                 
              first year.***//
