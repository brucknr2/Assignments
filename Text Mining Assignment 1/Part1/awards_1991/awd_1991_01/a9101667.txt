Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The primary objective of this research is to apply combined                    
              biomarker molecular.structural/compound.specific isotopic                      
              analyses to study of a suite of particulate samples and surface                
              sediments from the Black Sea and the Sargasso Sea.  This                       
              project is aimed at demonstrating that compound.specific carbon                
              isotope compositions of particulate organic matter provide                     
              substantially more information on the sources and processing of                
              particulate matter in the water column that can be obtained by                 
              bulk carbon isotopic measurements and lipid biomarker                          
              distributions alone.  New insight will be gained into the                      
              behavior of particulate organic matter in two markedly                         
              different oceanic regimes:  an oxygenated oligotrophic water                   
              column (the Sargasso Sea) and a marine anoxic basin (the Black                 
              Sea).  These two sites are chosen because sample suites for                    
              lipid biomarker and isotopic analyses are presently on hand.                   
              Particles from these two locations will also have very                         
              different lipid distributions and should likewise have                         
              different isotopic compositions.  Thus, this study will not                    
              only be determining the biomarker/isotope signatures of                        
              particles in a depth profile from some location in the ocean                   
              but will also be comparing organism matter processing in the                   
              very different environments.
