Abstract    :
              Long-term, continuous records on individual sea otters in a                    
              population that is near equilibrium are needed to examine                      
              hypotheses concerning how population status influences social                  
              behavior, foraging and reproduction.  Similar data already                     
              exists for expanding populations at Prince William Sound,                      
              Attu Island, Alaska and California.  Dr. Siniff proposes to                    
              collect data among various individuals of different ages and                   
              sexes at Amchitka Island, where the population has been at                     
              equilibrium.  These records will be compared with complementary                
              data from populations which are increasing.  Radio                             
              transmitters, surgically implanted, will be used to locate                     
              the animals and to follow the activity, agonistic                              
              interactions, survival and reproduction.  Dr. Siniff                           
              believes that such individual-level comparisons between                        
              populations of known status have never been made for any                       
              carnivore species.  This approach to population assessment                     
              should prove useful in managing now expanding sea otter                        
              populations.
