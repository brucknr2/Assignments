Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This applicant proposes to study a genetic sequence in the maize               
              Adhl gene that is known to be necessary specifically for gene                  
              expression in the root.  In particular, the work will focus on                 
              identifying the location and nature of the cis-acting sequence with            
              characterization at the RNA level.  The work is planned to take                
              place in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Freeling at the University              
              of California, Berkeley.
