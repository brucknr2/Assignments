Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research on the ecological factors favouring andromonoecy in                   
              Zigadenus lilies (Liliaceae) is proposed.  Andromonoecy is an                  
              uncommon type of plant breeding system that has received little                
              attention and whose adaptive significance is poorly understood.                
              Individual plants of andromonoecious species possess both male                 
              and hermaphrodite flowers, so it is necessary to explain (1) why               
              female function has been eliminated in some flowers, and (2) why               
              male flowers have been retained.  These are questions of how                   
              resources should be allocated to, and packaged within, male and                
              female reproductive structures.  Thus, crucial to an                           
              understanding of the system is precise knowledge of how male and               
              female fitnesses increase with increased allocation to each                    
              sexual function, particularly with increases in flower number.                 
              To determine the shapes of these fitness gain curves a                         
              combination of experimental manipulations of flower number,                    
              nutrient supplementations, pollinator observations, fluorescent                
              dyes to track pollen movement, and genetic markers for                         
              determining paternity will be used.  This will be one of the                   
              first studies to test predictions about the adaptive significance              
              of a plant breeding system by measuring male and female gain                   
              curves in a natural population.
