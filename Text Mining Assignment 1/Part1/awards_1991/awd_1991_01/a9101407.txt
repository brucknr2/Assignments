Abstract    :
                   This project splits into two major portions.  The first                   
              portion concerns the study of permutation representations.                     
              The principal investigator will classify all monodromy groups                  
              of primitive branched coverings of Riemann surfaces which                      
              are sufficiently large in terms of the genus. The second                       
              portion is concerned with how various properties of matrices and               
              representations over a commutative ring are affected by extending              
              the base ring.                                                                 
                   A group is an algebraic object having a multiplication defined            
              on it.  Groups occur naturally in many areas of mathematics, as                
              well as chemistry and physics.  This project is concerned with                 
              classifying monodromy groups.
