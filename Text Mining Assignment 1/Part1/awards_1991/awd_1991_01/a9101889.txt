Abstract    :
              This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode,                 
              provides limited funding for a one-year probe to explore whether               
              segmentation and extraction of features for optical character                  
              recognition (OCR) can be done directly from gray-scale (non-                   
              binarized) images.  This method would preserve information now lost            
              and avoid the noise and errors introduced during image binarization            
              for the typical connected-components approach to OCR.  The                     
              resulting approach should be more robust, and should support                   
              recognition of text of poor print quality in a variety of fonts.
