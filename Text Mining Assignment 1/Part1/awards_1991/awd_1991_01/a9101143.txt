Abstract    :
                   Professor Spitkovsky will conduct research on certain topics              
              in operator and matrix theory in which he has been involved for the            
              past several years.  He will investigate problems in the following             
              areas: (1) factorization of sectorial matrices on non-smooth                   
              contours, (2) local behavior of factorization multipliers, (3)                 
              connections between left and right partial indices, (4)                        
              factorizability of piecewise-quasi-continuous matrices, (5)                    
              factorization of almost periodic matrices and positive extensions              
              of almost-periodic functions, (6) generalizations of the spectrum              
              assignment theorem, and (7) generalizations of the power inequality            
              for numerical range.                                                           
                   Factorization of matrix valued functions (into other matrices             
              with specific properties) is an important tool in many areas of                
              mathematics and its applications such as systems theory,                       
              probability theory, and differential and integral equations.                   
              Professor Spitkovsky's research is basic to these areas.
