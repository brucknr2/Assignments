Abstract    :
              This is a request from the Department of Chemistry of the State                
              University of New York, University Center at Binghamton for funds              
              to purchase a computer graphics workstation for molecular                      
              modeling.  Molecular modeling has become an indispensable method               
              in a number of research groups within the Chemistry Department,                
              and the addition of a computer graphics workstation to the                     
              Department's instrumentation capabilities will significantly                   
              enhance both current and future research efforts.                              
                                                                                             
              The instrument is needed by members of the Chemistry Department                
              for research in the areas of:                                                  
                                                                                             
              (1) Molecular modeling of carbohydrates.                                       
              (2) Molecular modeling of tubulin-colchicine interactions.                     
              (3) Molecular modeling of C-disaccharides.                                     
              (4) Mapping membrane fluidity
