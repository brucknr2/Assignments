Abstract    :
              On this new research effort several numerical studies will be                  
              undertaken on particles with fractional statistics (anyons).                   
              Fractional statistics arise in connection with particle number                 
              fractionalization in two dimensions; it has been shown to occur in             
              the fractional quantum Hall effect, and may also occur in the high             
              temperature superconductors.  A stochastic sampling (Monte Carlo)              
              algorithm for fractional statistics will be developed and tested.              
              This work is the first of its kind and should substantially enhance            
              our ability to treat the many-anyon problem.  Studies of exact                 
              diagonalization techniques for anyons will continue.  In                       
              particular, we will examine the magnetic moment arising from the               
              screening by anyons of a charged impurity; the temperature                     
              dependence of the spontaneous magnetic moment in the unperturbed               
              system; and the Hall conductance of anyons in zero field.                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The discovery of the possible relevance of particles obeying                   
              fractional statistics to the fractional quantum Hall effect and                
              high temperature superconductivity has renewed interest in these               
              strange particles called anyons.  These particles are unique to                
              two-dimensional space and possess properties different than the                
              more conventional bosons and fermions.  While anyons are of                    
              fundamental theoretical interest, their possible relevance to high             
              temperature superconductors has stimulated searches for                        
              experimental verification of their role in these two-dimensional               
              materials.
