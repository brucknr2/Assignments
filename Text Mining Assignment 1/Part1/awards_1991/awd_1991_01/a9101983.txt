Abstract    :
              We request funds for a beta-scanner with the capability to                     
              quantitatively analyze radioactively labelled (P32, S35, and C14)              
              nucleic acid and protein blots.  We will establish a joint                     
              facility that will primarily serve seven laboratories, five in                 
              the Biology department and two in the Biochemistry department.                 
              The requested instrumentation will be used to accomplish goals of              
              currently funded projects.  The research effort in all                         
              laboratories has a very strong molecular methodology component.                
              Major research efforts involve elucidation of recombination                    
              mechanisms in yeast and E.coli, transcriptional regulation in                  
              Drosophila, and in immunoglobulin genes, control of DNA                        
              replication in Xenopus, molecular-genetics of Drosophila                       
              neurodevelopment, and development of methodology for gene                      
              isolation.  Several projects have a special emphasis o protein-                
              nucleic acid interactions.  The proposed instrument will enhance               
              the quantitative precision of the ongoing work, and will make                  
              possible experiments that are too time consuming with existing                 
              instruments.  Equally important, the proposed instrument will                  
              enable us to plan experiments that were previously unrealistic                 
              because of the high degree of precision necessary in the                       
              interpretation of data.
