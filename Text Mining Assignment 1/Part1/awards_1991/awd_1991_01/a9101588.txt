Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is              
              in the general area of of analytical and surface chemistry.  It                
              builds upon the successes realized during the conduct of the Phase             
              1 project.  The long range scientific goals of this research are               
              to develop methods of analysis of real world samples, to make                  
              improvements in the instrumentation, and to determine the limits               
              of instrument performance using well characterized test samples.               
              Neutron activation of elements produces radionuclides.                         
              Characteristic gamma-rays associated with the radionuclide                     
              disintegrations can be measured with germanium detectors.                      
              Secondary electrons produced at the surface of a thin sample as a              
              beta-particle exits the sample can be accelerated and imaged.                  
              When these gamma-rays and beta-particles are detected in                       
              coincidence, the gamma-ray answers the question "what" and the                 
              secondary electron answers the question "where" for an individual              
              radionuclide disintegration.  This information can be organized                
              into element maps and local area gamma-rays spectra.

              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project                 
              will continue the efforts initially started during the Phase 1                 
              project.  An important goal of the SBIR Program is the ultimate                
              conversion of NSF-supported research into technological innovation             
              and commercial application.
