Abstract    :
                   A new patented method to reduce the oscillatory behavior of               
              electro-mechanical systems, called Command Input Pulse Shaping, was            
              successfully demonstrated in Phase I of this SBIR effort.  When                
              implemented on essentially single-mode systems, dramatic                       
              improvements in dynamic behavior were observed, with settling times            
              being reduced by factors ranging from 3 to 5.  The current work is             
              to now implement this technique to more complex multi-mode systems             
              and to refine and fine tune the procedure to achieve better and                
              quicker results.                                                               
                   The economic and technological impact of this work is                     
              potentially tremendous.  Almost all electro-mechanical machinery,              
              in manufacturing and other industries, are constrained in their                
              ability to perform by their dynamic characteristics that leads to              
              vibratory motion.  A practical technique that can counter this,                
              would have far reaching consequences in terms of improving                     
              performance and allowing the equipment to perform at increased                 
              rates.  The economic impact of this possibility could be                       
              significant.
