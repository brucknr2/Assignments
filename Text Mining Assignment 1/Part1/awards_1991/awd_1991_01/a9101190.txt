Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigators propose to carry out research                       
                                                                                            
              on the effects of the ratio of alpha to beta glucose on                        
              the specific growth rates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and                      
                                                                                             
              E. coli, as well as the effect of this ratio on the                            
              kinetics of byproducts from these organisms, such as                           
              ethanol and acetic acid.  Continuous and fed-batch                             
              fermentations will be carried out, and optimization                            
              studies will seek to produce high cellular growth rates                        
              and yields with minimal byproduct formation.
