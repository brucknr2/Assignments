Abstract    :
                   Ordinal categorical data occur extensively in medical                     
              diagnostic tests, and attitudinal surveys. Investigation will be               
              carried out on fitting the Rasch model which describe these types              
              of data well.  The work will provide an unified structure for                  
              analyzing sociological data.                                                   
                   A study of the properties of the estimators using geometric               
              analysis is expected to yield insightful results.  A computer                  
              code will also be developed to facilitate the numerical fitting.
