Abstract    :
              This applicant will study the physiological function and related               
              activities of insulin degrading enzyme (a metalloendoprotease) in              
              chinese hamster ovary cells.  Specifically, the work will focus                
              on the enzyme's suspected activities, including insulin                        
              degradation and muscle differentiation, by disrupting the                      
              appropriate gene in ovary cells and characterizing the resultant               
              cell line.  The work is planned to take place in the laboratory                
              of Dr. Richard Roth and Stanford University.
