              d'Industrie, Paris, France.  The researchers plan to                           
              continue work on a history of the Socit d'Encouragement                      
              pour l'Industrie Nationale, a Paris society established                        
              to apply science to industry and agriculture.  They will                       
              examine the application of science to industry and                             
              agriculture within the setting of this French institution,                     
              from its founding in 1801 to its near collapse in 1941.                        
              The activities of this society in promoting the application                    
              of science to industry and agriculture are particularly                        
              important since a key aspect of the modernization of                           
              French society has been the interaction of science and                         
              technology with economic, political, and cultural forces.
