Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided for updated computing resources for the Woods               
              Hole Oeanographic Institution's Ocean Bottom Seismology group.                 
              OBSs are used for a broad range of studies, including tomographic              
              experiments, microearthquakes measurements, deep.towed explosive               
              seismology, etc. The new resources will allow the group to                     
              transition between a VAX.based to SUN.based system, effecting                  
              many users of this facility.
