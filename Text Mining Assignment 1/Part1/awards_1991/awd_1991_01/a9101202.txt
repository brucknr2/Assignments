Abstract    :
                   Previous studies of micro-instabilities in a hot plasma have              
              generally employed the plasma dispersion function which is                     
              strictly applicable only to a Maxwilliam distribution.  Natural                
              plasmas, however, contain a pronounced high energy component                   
              which can best be modeled a by Lorentzian distribution.  The                   
              stability properties of such a distribution can be substantially               
              different from that of a Maxwilliam plasma leading to dramatic                 
              changes in the growth or damping rate of plasma waves.  This                   
              grant is to evaluate explicitly the stability of a Lorentzian                  
              plasma and to investigate the path integrated gain of waves in a               
              fully hot plasma using a hot ray tracing code.  ***
