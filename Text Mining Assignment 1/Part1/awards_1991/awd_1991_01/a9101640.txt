Abstract    :
                   Many interesting optimization problems are nonsmooth, i.e. either         
              the function to be optimized or an associated constraint is not                
              differentiable on some part of its domain.  The main goal of this              
              project is the design of efficient algorithms for some important               
              classes of nonsmooth optimization problems.  This is possible only by          
              taking full advantage of the structure which is present.  Because of           
              the lack of smoothness, standard algorithms are not applicable.                
                   The investigation primarily addresses three issues.  The first is         
              the optimization of eigenvalues of symmetric matrices which depend on          
              parameters.  Typically, solutions involve multiple eigenvalues which           
              are not smooth functions of the matrix elements.  Applications of              
              interest include the optimal design of columns and plates against              
              buckling.  The second major issue is the design of methods for a broad         
              problem class:  convex composite optimization.  By appropriate                 
              parameterization of the generalized gradient set it is hoped to obtain         
              efficient methods with superlinear convergence.  The third issue               
              concerns non-Lipschitz optimization problems involving eigenvalues of          
              nonsymmetric matrices.  For example, an important application arising          
              in the stability of control systems is to minimize the spectral radius         
              of a matrix.
