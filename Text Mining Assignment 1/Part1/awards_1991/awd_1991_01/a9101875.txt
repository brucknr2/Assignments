Abstract    :
              The proposed research concerns the exploration of techniques for               
              reconfiguration of task modules on distributed-memory machines when            
              faults occur.  The problems include (1) trade offs between local               
              and global reconfiguration; (2) communications required to support             
              reconfiguration and task computation after successful recovery; (3)            
              fault-tolerant embedding; (4) analysis of the residual structure               
              of networks in the presence of faulty nodes, and (5) extensive                 
              simulations of fault patterns and the performance of algorithms                
              developed on a Paralex 10-dimensional hypercube.
