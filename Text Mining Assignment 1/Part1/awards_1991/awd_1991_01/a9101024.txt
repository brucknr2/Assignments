Abstract    :
              The Marine Board of the National Research Council's (NRC)                      
              Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems serves the                     
              national interest by providing as a result of requests from                    
              sponsoring agencies, or on its own initiative, evaluations and                 
              advice concerning ocean developments and uses and the nation's                 
              ability to meet its marine and maritime goals.  The board                      
              considers questions of the relation of engineering and technology              
              to costal and offshore resource development and operations; to                 
              navigation and the commerce of the sea, waterways, and ports to                
              related human resources and onshore activities; and their                      
              relation to the establishment and implementation of public                     
              policies.  The Board identifies opportunities and needs for new                
              technologies and other developments and recommends appropriate                 
              actions.  It stimulates the exchange of information and                        
              cooperative activities, and provides a forum for the national and              
              international professional community.                                          
                                                                                             
              The activities through which the Board accomplishes its program                
              are:  (1) assessments of the technical capability to undertake                 
              and manage offshore and maritime development technology                        
              development; (2) evaluations of safety of personnel and of the                 
              environment; (3) assistance in the preparation and assessment of               
              the government's programs directed to ocean and maritime                       
              developments and uses; and (4) identification of future                        
              opportunities for the integration of advanced technology into                  
              marine or maritime systems and the influence of technical                      
              advances on the establishment and implementation of public                     
              policy.
