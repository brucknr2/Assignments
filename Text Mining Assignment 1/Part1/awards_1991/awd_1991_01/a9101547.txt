Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out                          
              principally in electromagnetic nuclear physics, but with some                  
              continued effort in hadronic probes as well.  The activities                   
              will include:  (1) study of the nucleon electric and magnetic                  
              polarizability, measurement of the delta resonance d-state,                    
              and probes of meson exchange currents in the deuteron                          
              photodisintegration using polarized gamma rays at BNL's LEGS                   
              facility; (2) nuclear structure studies using polarized                        
              deuterons to isolate discrete isoscalar states and resonances                  
              at Saclay's Saturne facility; (3) fundamental neutral pi and                   
              eta meson production at Saturne and later at the Bonn electron                 
              accelerator; and for the future, (4) vector meson                              
              electroproduction and decay using the CEBAF CLAS detector.                     
              For the latter experiments, development work will be carried                   
              out on the data acquisition and detector control software.
