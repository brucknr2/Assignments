Abstract    :
              This is a two year research program in response to the joint                   
              NSF/EPRI program announcement on ADvanced Polymeric Materials.                 
              Strong, durable, and lightweight composites are suitable materials             
              for construction of electrical transmission structures.  This                  
              research is aimed toward the development of composite members with             
              superior properties at reasonably low cost for construction of                 
              power transmission tower structures.  A novel composite processing             
              method will be studied which combines the braiding process with the            
              pultrusion process to make composite members with a uniaxially                 
              reinforced core and a braided sheath.  Composite structural members            
              from such process will be evaluated and compared with pultruded                
              (uniaxial reinforcement only), pultruded with ordinary off-axial               
              reinforcement (e.g. winding), and braided parts.  The evaluation               
              will include theoretical analysis and experimental assessment of               
              joint strength, shear resistance, and compressive behavior.  Aging             
              study (e.g. UV, temperature, humidity), field test, and cost-                  
              benefit analysis will also be conducted, in corporation with the               
              Transmission and Distribution Research Laboratory of the Georgia               
              Power Company.
