Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a dissertation improvement proposal.                               
                                                                                            
              The research investigates relations between aggregate (community)              
              and family wealth, and husbands' share of family work.  While the              
              link between social wealth and family work has not previously                  
              been studied, PIs expect to find that husbands' shares will                    
              increase as family wealth increases.  The reason, investigators                
              believe, is that as wives' resources increase, so does their                   
              power in the family, and hence, the amount of household work they              
              can expect from their spouses.  The research thus introduces ex-               
              change/power theories to demographic issues.
