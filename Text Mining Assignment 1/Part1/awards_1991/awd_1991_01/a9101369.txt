Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research project will support a student of                   
              cultural anthropology studying gift exchange in a rural community              
              in north China.  The research will examine the social                          
              ramifications of patterned exchanged of gifts and analyze the                  
              cultural rules and operative logic of gift exchange, especially                
              with regard to the mitigation of the famine that China endured in              
              1959-61.  Methods include participant observation and a survey of              
              village families.  The student is a native speaker of Chinese.                 
                                                                                             
              This research is important because village systems of informal                 
              exchange between families are vitally important means of                       
              distributing goods in all societies, yet are invisible to public               
              statistics.  Understanding how the system works in one case,                   
              especially focused on behavior during a famine, will advance our               
              understanding of the limits of reciprocity in human societies.
