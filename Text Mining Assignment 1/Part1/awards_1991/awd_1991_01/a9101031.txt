Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Schlesinger will organize a workshop to plan and coordinate a              
              soil warming experiment to be conducted at wide variety of                     
              research sites, including LTER sites, across North America.  The               
              workshop will establish formal protocols for the experiment and                
              establish a minimum standard set of dependent variables to be                  
              measured in response to soil warming.  The products of the                     
              workshop will include a formal workshop report and coordination                
              of a future proposal to fund the soil warming experiment.
