Abstract    :
              In forming processes such as extrusion, the quality of the product             
              depends in a complex manner on the parameters governing the                    
              process.  For example, when plastics are extruded, severe swelling             
              and shape change occur as the material emerges from the die.  The              
              equations describing such processes are extremely complex.  The                
              research to be carried out is aimed at developing a computational              
              scheme uniquely suited to solving these equations.  This scheme can            
              aid in identifying parameters which most affect the formed product             
              and perhaps eventually serve as a tool in process control.
