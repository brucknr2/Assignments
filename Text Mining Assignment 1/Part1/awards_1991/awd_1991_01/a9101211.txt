Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There is a growing concern about recent population declines in                 
              forest breeding songbirds in North America.  The absence of many               
              of these species from small forest tracts has led to questions                 
              about the effects of forest fragmentation on songbird                          
              reproductive success.  Increased nest predation and brood                      
              parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds appear to be associated with               
              increased forest fragmentation.  There is, however, a paucity of               
              data on the impact of cowbird parasitism and nest predation on                 
              the reproductive success of individual species of forest-nesting               
              birds.  The purpose of this study is to examine the population                 
              dynamics of the wood thrush, a rapidly declining forest songbird.              
              The factors determining reproductive success on three study sites              
              in a moderately fragmented region, the Shawnee National Forest of              
              southern Illinois where cowbird parasitism and nest predation                  
              rates are high will be studied.  These data will be used to                    
              evaluate a model of population dynamics that proposes that some                
              populations (sources) regularly produce surplus offspring which                
              immigrate to other populations (sinks) which would otherwise                   
              become extinct as a result of low reproductive success.  This                  
              model will be evaluated at regional, local and temporal scales.
