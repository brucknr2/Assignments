Abstract    :
                   Professor Fu will study possible analogs of scalar-valued                 
              curvatures on singular spaces. The principal investigator has                  
              already made some progress in this direction and will try to extend            
              his work from special cases to more general singular spaces. The               
              primary method to be used in the investigation is geometric measure            
              theory.                                                                        
                   One of the goals of this research is to understand how                    
              classical invariants of geometry such as curvature can be extended             
              to singular spaces, that is, spaces with corners, cusps, or self               
              intersections. These classical invariants are very important in our            
              understanding of the geometry of a space and the extension of these            
              concepts to singular spaces, which are playing an increasingly                 
              central role in the modeling of physical systems, should have                  
              immediate application.
