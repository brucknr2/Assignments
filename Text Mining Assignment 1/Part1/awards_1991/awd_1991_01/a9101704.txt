Abstract    :
                   Within the past decade there has been an increasing                       
              awareness of the importance of oceans in the climate and                       
              biogeochemical cycles of our world.  Biologically, the primary                 
              producers of the oceans play a major role in these effects.  The               
              37th Brookhaven Symposium on Biology: Primary Productivity and                 
              Biogeochemical Cycles in the Sea, will provide a major synopsis                
              of where we have come in this area of research in the past decade              
              and will provide a forum for discussions on the future needs in                
              biological and chemical oceanography.
