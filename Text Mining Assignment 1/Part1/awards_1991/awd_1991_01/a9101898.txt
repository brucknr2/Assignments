Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor J. Stembridge               
              to work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate the theory                
              of immanants, study symmetric functions, the representations of                
              Lie superalgebras and projective representation of Weyl groups.                
              He also hopes to find a faster algorithm for computing plethysms               
              relevant to classical invariant theory.                                        
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And so, it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design                
              of algorithms in computer science.
