Abstract    :
              Professor George D. Sturgeon and other members of the Chemistry                
              Department at the University of Nebraska are being supported to                
              conduct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in                
              Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, eight undergraduate                        
              students will spend twelve weeks each summer actively engaged                  
              in a variety of research projects.  Projects range from mass                   
              spectrometry and solid state NMR of zeolites to investigation                  
              of organic molecular recognition and immobilized enzymes.                      
              Students will participate in weekly seminars to discuss their                  
              results, visit local industries, and attend local cultural and                 
              sporting events as a group.
