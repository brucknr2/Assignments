Abstract    :
                   The overall objective of the project is the development of a              
              comprehensive control system for turning centers, based on reliable            
              process models, the sensing and processing of multiple process                 
              monitoring signals, and the intelligent control of the system in               
              response to limiting factors and disturbances.  The emphasis is on             
              the development of intermediate products and solutions in the areas            
              of design, manufacturing, and control.                                         
                   Analytically deterministic models including process control               
              and machine tool dynamics, act as the link between the top-down                
              expected process parameters used to set sensors thresholds and the             
              bottom-up information flow of extracted and interpreted sensor                 
              data.  The comprehensive strategy is designed to augment the                   
              controllability and reliability of the machining process through               
              a multi-model, multi-sensor system which increases the quantity and            
              quality of process information.  The system demonstrates input                 
              control evaluating process parameter specifications as well as                 
              output control determined by the condition of the workpiece or                 
              process outputs conveying disturbance-type limiting factors.  This             
              project is a step in the process of moving to unmanned                         
              manufacturing.
