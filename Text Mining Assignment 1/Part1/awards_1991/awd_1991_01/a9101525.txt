Abstract    :
              The research proposed here is in the area of monolithic high-                  
              frequency communication circuits and is directed at exploring new              
              ways to use silicon integrated-circuit technology to improve the               
              performance and reduce the cost of communication systems of various            
              kinds with primary emphasis on data communications.  Particular                
              emphasis is placed on circuit techniques applicable to clock                   
              recovery in high-speed communications systems, optimization of the             
              sensitivity in fiber-optic communication receivers, and the                    
              application of BICMOS technology for the particular needs of                   
              high?speed communications applications.  We feel that continuing               
              efforts in this area are likely to produce results which will have             
              significant impact on integrated-circuit design for communication              
              systems.
