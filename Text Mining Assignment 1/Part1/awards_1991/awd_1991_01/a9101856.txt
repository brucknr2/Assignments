Abstract    :
                   The upper atmosphere depart significantly from radiative                  
              equilibrium and have a circulation and thermal structure that                  
              appear to be mostly due to forcing by small-scale gravity wave                 
              motion.  Although this region of the atmosphere exhibits a large               
              number of interesting aeronomical phenomena, it is the least                   
              understood region of the earth's atmosphere.  Detailed studies of              
              chemical and dynamical coupling in the upper atmosphere and lower              
              thermosphere thus have been identified as one major component of               
              the NSF CEDAR program.                                                         
                   Gravity wave parameters are useful for understanding the                  
              dynamics in this region.  A collection of various CEDAR                        
              instruments such as lidar, optical, and radar systems, is                      
              required in order to improve  our knowledge of gravity waves and               
              turbulence field.  Such a collection, including the PIs' airglow               
              spectrometer, participated in  a CEDAR supported campaign,                     
              Airborne Lidar and Observations of the Hawaiian Airglow (ALOHA),               
              which was successfully conducted in March and April of 1990.  The              
              participating experiments included groundbased airglow imagers                 
              and interferometers at Haleaukala Observatory, SAD and meteor                  
              radars at Christmas Island, a Na temperature lidar and meteor                  
              radar in Colorado, and airglow spectrometers onboard the NCAR                  
              Electra along with a Na lidar.  This proposal requests support to              
              analyze the data obtained by the Michigan airglow spectrometer                 
              onboard the Electra and to interpret the airglow results with                  
              additional information from those obtained by the other                        
              instruments.
