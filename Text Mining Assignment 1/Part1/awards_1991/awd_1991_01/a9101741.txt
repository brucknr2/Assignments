Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The work will focus on regional (as opposed                                    
              to single site) flood frequency analysis with                                  
              the purpose of estimating flood quantiles                                      
              based on information available at many sites                                   
              in a region.  One specific objective is to                                     
              study in detail the characterization of                                        
              floods which exhibit correlations among the                                    
              sites of the region.  The analytical work                                      
              will be carried out to allow both spatial                                      
              dependence and parametric structure to be                                      
              considered, and to assess the utility of                                       
              historical/paleo-data in a regional setting.                                   
              The potential gains of regional analysis over                                  
              single site analysis will be determined by                                     
              comparing various simulation models.  Models                                   
              that have features in common and that are                                      
              compatible with real flood data will be                                        
              identified and corresponding applications                                      
              will be made.
