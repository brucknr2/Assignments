Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A modeling effort using the recently developed semi-spectral                   
              primitive equation model by Haidvogel will investigate the energy              
              and mass exchange over the continental margin due to interaction               
              between topographic waves generated by Gulf Stream rings and the               
              sloping topography.
