Abstract    :
                   This grant is funded by NSF, NASA, and NOAA as support for                
              the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Core                     
              Project Office.  The work involves: (1) coordination of the                    
              advisory committee and scientific activities of IGAC including

              where appropriate, (2) the development (and subsequent updating)               
              of comprehensive descriptions of the goals, ongoing activities,                
              and future plans of each of the IGAC Activities, (3) coordination              
              of funding activities including the development of a summary of                
              the available resources for IGAC in the participating countries,               
              and a detailed statement of the future needs for IGAC, (4)                     
              provision of an international information and communications                   
              center for IGAC, and (5) fostering of cooperation between IGAC,                
              its co-sponsors (CACGP,IGBP), and related IGBP and WCRP programs.
