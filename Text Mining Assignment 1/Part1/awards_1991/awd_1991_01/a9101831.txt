Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with research in commutative                    
              algebra on local rings and their singularities.  Topics include                
              the Hilbert function and Hilbert polynomial of an m-primary ideal              
              in a Cohen-Macaulay local ring, and birational extensions and                  
              completions of local domains.  The work has specific applications              
              to algebraic geometry, particularly to the problem of resolution               
              of singularities.                                                              
                   Commutative rings are algebraic structures possessing a                   
              commutative addition and a commutative multiplication.  These                  
              structures occur throughout mathematics.  Common examples include              
              polynomial rings, and rings of algebraic integers in extension                 
              fields of the rationals.  This project is concerned with a                     
              variety of questions on the structure of commutative rings.
