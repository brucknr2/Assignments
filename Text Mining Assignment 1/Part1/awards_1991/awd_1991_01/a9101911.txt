Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will work on problems in dynamical            
              systems and Riemannian geometry. In particular they will study                 
              geodesic flows and geodesic stretch on spaces of negative curvature            
              and on tori. One of their previous results gave a proof of a                   
              special case of the Hopf conjecture which states that a Riemannian             
              metric without conjugate points on the torus is flat. They will                
              attempt to extend their methods from dynamical systems to the                  
              general case.                                                                  
                   Riemannian geometry attempts to relate global properties of               
              manifolds or surfaces such as the topological structure to local               
              properties such as curvature. The standard method for obtaining                
              these relationships has been through the global solution of partial            
              differential equations. The principal investigators take a                     
              different tack; they use the theory of dynamical systems defined on            
              the manifold. This involves the study of iterations of mappings of             
              the manifold and in their case takes advantage of the structure of             
              groups of these mappings. If they are successful in developing the             
              method, it should have application to a wide range of problems in              
              Riemannian geometry.
