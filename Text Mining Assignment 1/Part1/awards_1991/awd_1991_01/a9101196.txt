Abstract    :
                   Professor Yau will investigate the extent to which the Euler              
              equations of fluid flow can be derived from taking a scaling limit             
              of Hamiltonian systems.  Initially this work will be done with some            
              randomness added into the equations.  The research project will be             
              carried out jointly with S. Olla and S.R.S. Varadhan.  The main                
              goals of the project are to derive the equations for long enough               
              time periods to see shock waves and to understand the Lax entropy              
              conditions microscopically.                                                    
                   The aim of this research is to obtain a fundamental                       
              understanding of the partial differential equations of fluid                   
              dynamics, the Euler equations.  From a fundamental point of view,              
              matter, in particular a liquid, is made up of a huge but finite                
              number of particles (say atoms) which are interacting with each                
              other.  The research project of Professor Yau involves an attempt              
              to understand how the usual concept of a fluid, which is                       
              continuous, can be reconciled with the more fundamental particle               
              concept.
