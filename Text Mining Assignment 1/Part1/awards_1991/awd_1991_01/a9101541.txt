Abstract    :
              The principal investigator continues his research on the design and            
              evaluation of the memory hierarchy of high-performance systems.                
              Uniprocessors as well as shared-memory multiprocessors will be                 
              studied.  The studies will cover innovative architectural features,            
              compiler support, and protocols and hardware synchronization                   
              primitives for several parallel programming models.                            
                                                                                             
              In case of uniprocessors, a hardware-based preloading scheme that              
              should reduce the number of misses in data caches, will be                     
              investigated.  Compiler support for this hardware function will also           
              be investigated.                                                               
                                                                                             
              In the case of multiprocessors, various protocols and possibly                 
              enhanced synchronization primitives to cater to several consistency            
              models will be investigated.  The goal is to reduce the impact of the          
              performance degradation components (large memory latency, processor            
              stalling, network traffic) arising from the access to shared                   
              variables.  Other topics include architectural features such as the            
              use of the interconnection network, or one of its levels, as a                 
              component of the memory hierarchy.                                             
                                                                                             
              Trace-driven simulation will be the choice performance evaluation              
              tool.  Computer-intensive programs with large data sets drawn from             
              scientific and CAD tool application will be instrumented.
