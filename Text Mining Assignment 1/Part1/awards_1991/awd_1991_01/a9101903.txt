Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will study problems in geometric              
              analysis that arise in the calculus of variations and mathematical             
              physics. These problems include the motion of level sets by mean               
              curvature, existence of multivortices of the electroweak theory in             
              a periodic cell, and boundary value problems for surfaces of                   
              constant Gauss curvature. In addition they will study various                  
              problems associated with minimal surfaces such as rigidity and                 
              symmetry loss for periodic minimal surfaces.                                   
                   Many problems in mathematical physics may be framed in terms              
              of a minimization problem. For example, given a closed curve in                
              space one might want to find a surface with average curvature equal            
              to zero and which has the given curve as its boundary. This problem            
              may be restated as the problem of finding the surface of minimum               
              area with the given curve as boundary. Such a surface occurs in a              
              physical setting as a bubble, for example, a soap bubble. This type            
              of problem is known as a variational problem.  The principal                   
              investigators will study these problems using techniques from                  
              analysis and geometry.
