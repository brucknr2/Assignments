Abstract    :
              This award supports continued collaboration on kelp genetics                   
              between the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the                   
              Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao.                 
              Major goals of the research are to obtain gametophytes with                    
              specific characteristics to facilitate genetic manipulation, to                
              develop the technology for cultivating kelp gametophytes that can              
              be seeded on rope, and to use this technique to produce and                    
              characterize genetically determined strains of kelp.                           
                                                                                             
              Kelp are ecologically and commercially important organisms, but                
              study of kelp genetics is still in its infancy.  This study                    
              brings together interests and capabilities in China and the US to              
              advance our understanding of an important scientific resource.
