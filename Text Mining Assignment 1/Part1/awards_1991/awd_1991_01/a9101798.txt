Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigators will work on a                
              number of problems in function theory, partial differential                    
              equations and quasiconformal mappings.  In particular,  Professor              
              Eremenko will continue his work on problems in holomorphic                     
              dynamics, specifically complex iteration theory.  He will also                 
              work on the theory of entire, meromorphic and subharmonic                      
              functions.  Professor Lewis will continue his work on parabolic                
              partial differential equations and symmetry theorems.  There is                
              finally joint work planned on a conjecture of Littlewood                       
              involving entire functions.                                                    
                   The classical fields of partial differential equations and                
              complex function theory have a great deal of material in common,               
              and very often the insights gained from viewing a problem from                 
              both viewpoints can be especially illuminating.  In this project               
              the principal investigators will work individually and jointly on              
              various interrelated problems in complex mappings, parabolic                   
              partial differential equations and holomorphic dynamics.
