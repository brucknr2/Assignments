Abstract    :
              Dr. Dahv A.V. Kliner has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                  
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Kliner's doctoral degree was from                
              Stanford University under the supervision of Professor Richard                 
              Zare.  Dr. Kliner intends to continue research at the                          
              University of Minnesota under the sponsorship of Professor Paul                
              Barbara.  Dr. Kliner's area of postdoctoral research will be                   
              ultrafast spectroscopic investigations of liquid-phase                         
              phenomena. Longer term, he plans to study the liquid-liquid                    
              interface by optical second harmonic generation and                            
              sum-frequency generation.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
