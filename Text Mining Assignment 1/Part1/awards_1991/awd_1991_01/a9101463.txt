Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will developa chronology for the Paleogene by                
              integrating magnetostratigraphy, stable isotope stratigraphy, Sr-              
              isotope, and biostratigraphy. The stratigraphic goal is to                     
              develop a Paleogene time scale, and to test biostratigraphic                   
              correlations between low and high latitudes. In addition, the                  
              work has the paleoceanographic goal of reconstructing deep-and                 
              surface-water fluctuations by makeing synoptic faunal and isotope              
              comparisons across two climate transitions, the Paleocene/Eocene               
              boundary and the late middle Eocene to early Oligocene.
