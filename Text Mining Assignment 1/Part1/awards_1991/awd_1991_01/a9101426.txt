Abstract    :
              This award will support Professors Sperry Darden and Sudhir                    
              Sen of Notre Dame University in collaboration with researchers                 
              Ghirardo Murillo, Marco Fernandez, Jesus Ramirez and Olga                      
              Avila of the Mexican National Institute for Nuclear Research                   
              (ININ).  The purpose of the research is to study the elastic                   
              scattering of protons using the tandem accelerators available                  
              at Notre Dame and ININ.  Measurements of elastic scattering                    
              will allow the determination of various energy-characterizing                  
              parameters and also help to gauge the success of model                         
              calculations that describe in detail nuclear structure.                        
                                                                                             
              Preliminary tests reveal the existence of interesting                          
              structures in the data.  The investigators intend to explore                   
              these structures by refining their experimental frame work,                    
              using smaller energy steps, increasing the number of angular                   
              measures, and measuring at energy levels not tried before.                     
              Measurements utilizing a polarized proton beam will be                         
              carried out at the University of Notre Dame, and exploratory                   
              cross-section excitation function measurements, as well as                     
              some cross-section measurements, will be carried out at the                    
              Mexican Nuclear Center.
