Abstract    :
                   MIDNET is one of approximately 20 mid-level networks which                
              connect to the NSFNET backbone.  Through the mid-levels, the NSFNET            
              links over a thousand university and college campuses, business and            
              industrial research laboratories, and governmental research centers            
              across the nation and around the world.  Using NSFNET, educators               
              and researchers access library resources, supercomputing centers,              
              satellite data, medical imaging, scientific instruments, video                 
              applications, national data bases, and colleagues worldwide.                   
                   This award funds upgrading the speed of the MIDNET                        
              communication line into each state from 56,000 bits per second to              
              1.544 million bits per second.  It also provides for part time                 
              effort of the Principal Investigator in managing the network.
