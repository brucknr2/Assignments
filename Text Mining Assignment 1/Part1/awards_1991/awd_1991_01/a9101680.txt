Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Brucat will study the gas-phase                     
              photodissociation spectroscopy of transition-metal molecular                   
              ions.  He will use optical probes, such as resonant two-photon                 
              dissociation spectroscopy and stimulated emission pumping, in                  
              order to learn about metal-metal and metal-ligand bond energies.               
              %%%                                                                            
              The studies in this project are aimed at understanding the                     
              fundamental bonding interactions in clusters.  With the results                
              of such work, the interactions between atoms in an ionic                       
              crystal or in a solvent may be more readily comprehended.                      
              Such an understanding might then be used to predict, for                       
              example, the course of chemical reactions in solution or the                   
              structure of the surface of a metal catalyst.
