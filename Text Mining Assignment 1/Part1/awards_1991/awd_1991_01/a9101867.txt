Abstract    :
              This project is a two-day bridge engineering workshop to be held               
              in Japan, in May 1991, followed by a study tour of bridge sites.               
              This in the seventh such workshop, conducted under the auspices of             
              the U.S. - Japan panel on wind and seismic effects of the UJNR                 
              Program.  The objective of the workshop is to have presentation of             
              technical papers related to retrofitting, modeling experimentation,            
              and monitoring of bridges of steel and concrete.
