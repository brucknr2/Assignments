Abstract    :
                   With support from this grant the PI will construct and                    
              deploy, at CEDAR and other field sites, a multiwavelength,                     
              computer controlled and pointed, stellar photometer to monitor                 
              the condition of the sky during airglow observations.  Data will               
              be obtained on atmospheric extinction at eight wavelengths                     
              including a water vapor absorption band.  These data will permit               
              the correction of airglow photometric data for absorption in the               
              earth's troposphere.  In addition, the background sky brightness               
              will be monitored at each wavelength.  Two wavelengths will be                 
              set at emission lines due to mercury and sodium which are emitted              
              strongly by outside lights at night.  Clouds illuminated by such               
              lighting produces a strong source of sky pollution which reduces               
              the quality of night sky observations.  Results from this                      
              instrument will be invaluable to other observers who must operate              
              their instrument in an unmanned automatic mode.  With data                     
              corrected for extinction better agreement between observations                 
              and model predictions should result; likewise agreement between                
              various observers' results should improve.  Commercial devices                 
              will be used as far as possible to reduce development time.  The               
              resulting data set will be provided to campaign observers and                  
              will be deposited in the CEDAR data bank.
