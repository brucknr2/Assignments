Abstract    :
                   One of the fundamental problems in mathematical physics is                
              that of understanding the ground-state of atoms.  This project will            
              examine this problem in three areas: (1) For a fixed atom of                   
              specific nuclear charge, an attempt will be made to understand its             
              ground state energy, (2) There will be a study of the asymptotics              
              of the ground state energy as the nuclear charge approaches                    
              infinity, and (3) The project will try to understand qualitative               
              properties of large atoms such as neutrality, together with related            
              observables, such as ionization energies.  In addition, this                   
              project will include work on random Schrodinger operators, Neumann             
              Laplacians, Scott Correction, and Coulomb scattering.  This project            
              supports a research team under the direction of Dr. Barry Simon.               
                   This project is in the general area of mathematical physics or            
              theoretical physics and concerns the structure and behavior of                 
              atomic particles.
