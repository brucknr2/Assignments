Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Campanulaceae is a widely-distributed flowering plant family               
              that contains many important and attractive garden ornamentals.                
              Determination of phylogenetic relationships within the family has              
              been problematical due to reliance on morphological characters                 
              that have undergone repeated convergent and parallel evolution.                
              This project will use chloroplast DNA data to generate the first               
              modern phylogeny of the family.  The molecular research has two                
              major phases: 1) characterization and delimitation of the                      
              distribution of chloroplast DNA structural rearrangements                      
              (inversions) throughout the family and their possible mechanisms;              
              and, 2) sequencing ORFK from the chloroplast DNA of                            
              representative species in the family and related taxa.                         
              Phylogenies generated from rearrangement and sequence data can be              
              used to compare systematic results generated from these two                    
              different types of molecular approaches.  The resulting DNA                    
              phylogenies will enable an independent assessment of                           
              morphological, chemical, and chromosomal evolution in the                      
              Campanulaceae.  Sequence comparisons will also provide                         
              information regarding relative rates and patterns of chloroplast               
              DNA evolution.
