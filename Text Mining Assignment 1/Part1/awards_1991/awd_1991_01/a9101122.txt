Abstract    :
              This grant will enable the American Association for the Advancement            
              of Science to confront one area in the impending crisis in the                 
              science and engineering workforce through a long-term project to               
              explore barriers for students with disabilities in engineering                 
              education.  The project will work with deans and faculties of                  
              schools of engineering to develop strategies for recruitment and               
              retention and to identify assistive technology and other support               
              services that give easier access to the educational process.  Six              
              schools of engineering will be selected as sites for model projects            
              in recruitment and retention of students with disabilities.  A                 
              parallel effort will assess methods of date collection on disabled             
              students and develop survey questions that can be directed at                  
              engineering schools.  Successful strategies will be disseminated               
              through a variety of networks.   At the end of the five year                   
              project, it is anticipated that many of the strategies will be                 
              institutionalized in schools of engineering and, data on retention             
              of students with disabilities will be included in all human                    
              resources studies.
