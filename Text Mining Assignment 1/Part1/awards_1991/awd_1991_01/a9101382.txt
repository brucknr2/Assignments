Abstract    :
                   This project will analyse systems of nonlinear degenerate                 
              partial differential equations of elliptic-parabolic type which                
              arise in modelling the combined flow of heat and electric current              
              in a metallic conductor, the welding of metal sheets, and                      
              biological groups the dispersal of avoid crowding.  Recent                     
              findings indicate that the existence assertion for these systems               
              is closely tied to the size of the sets where the equations                    
              involved become degenerate.  Equations in which the degeneracy                 
              causes the appearance of two free boundaries will also be                      
              studied.
