Abstract    :
              Existing incremental switch-level simulators are interpretive in               
              the sense that, upon stimulation of a transistor sub-network, they             
              use a graph representation method to dynamically evaluate its                  
              function.  In contrast, compiled switch-level simulators hardcode              
              their evaluation procedures into fast boolean operations and                   
              exploit the bit parallelism inherent in machine words.                         
                                                                                             
              This research examines compiled simulation techniques in the                   
              context of incremental capture and simulation.  A prototype system             
              capable of automatically generating compiled incremental                       
              resimulators is being built.  This generation system is designed               
              to interface directly with an incremental capture environment                  
              system and to generate incremental resimulators that will interface            
              directly with ICE.  Specific problems being addressed include:  (1)            
              using boolean logic equations and/or binary decision diagrams as               
              a basis for incremental switch-level simulation; (2) exploiting the            
              user-defined hierarchy to accelerate incremental circuit analysis:             
              (3) investigate bit parallelism in incremental simulation; (4)                 
              automatically generate compiled incremental resimulators; and (5)              
              explore time and space efficient methods for storing design                    
              information and history traces (data compression and data                      
              persistence).
