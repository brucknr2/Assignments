Abstract    :
              A flow cytometer will be employed in projects by two major and two             
              minor users.  1) It will be used to monitor quantitatively the                 
              progression of differentiation of sea urchin male germ line cells              
              in culture.  The large number of samples processed will make                   
              feasible the optimization of culture conditions and the evaluation             
              of effects of hormones, growth factors, and cell-cell interactions             
              in promoting production of sperm cell.  2) It will be used to                  
              characterize mechanisms which maintain lipid asymmetry in normal               
              and sickled red blood cells, and to probe the resistance of                    
              cytotoxic T lymphocytes to lysis by their product perforin                     
              (involved in antigen-specific killing of target cells by the                   
              mammalian immune system) using the dye merocyanine 540, a                      
              fluorescent molecule sensitive to lipid asymmetry of live cells.               
              The minor users will employ the instrument to 3) analyze expression            
              of cell surface molecules controlled by cell type specific                     
              promoters in cellular slime molds to study their developmental                 
              regulation, and 4) analyze as preparation for sorting and                      
              biochemical analysis of populations of rod outer segment disks from            
              the mammalian retina as they are processed and discarded with                  
              aging.
