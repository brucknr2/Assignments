Abstract    :
                   The mathematical analytic concept of regular variation is                 
              fundamental for the study of sums and of extremes.  This research              
              will investigate the applications of this branch of analysis to a              
              wider range of topics in probability and statistics, particularly              
              to infinitely divisible distributions and Levy processes, to                   
              nonparametric function estimation, to long-range dependence of                 
              variables, and to regression problems with infinite variance                   
              and/or large deviations.  Multivariate subexponentiality, a                    
              related concept, will be studied as it relates to tail-behavior                
              of extremes and of sums of random variables.
