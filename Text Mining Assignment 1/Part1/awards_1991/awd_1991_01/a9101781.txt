Abstract    :
              This award supports a collaboration to make high energy gamma                  
              ray observations in the Southern Hemisphere between Dr. Trevor                 
              C. Weekes of the Smithsonian-Astrophysics Observatory and Dr.                  
              Jorge Sahade and Dr. Hugo Levato both of La Plata University                   
              in Argentina.  They will explore the Galaxy's emission at                      
              all energies, and establish a TeV observatory in the southern                  
              hemisphere.  Sensitive ground-based observations of some of the                
              Galaxy can only be made from the southern hemisphere.  No                      
              such facility now exists.  The proposed Argentine observing                    
              site will be an excellent one for the purpose.                                 
                                                                                             
              The U.S. program in gamma ray astronomy will be benefitted by                  
              the proposed research in that TeV observations of the Galaxy                   
              will be conducted at a sensitivity not feasible from within                    
              the U.S.  It is clear that this will be a genuinely cooperative                
              piece of research, beneficial not only to the U.S., but to                     
              Argentine astrophysicists as well.  The latter will be                         
              trained in a technique that is new to them, work with modern                   
              equipment and will do most of the actual observing.  Further,                  
              a good working relationship will be furthered between the                      
              U.S. and Argentine communities in high energy astronomy.
