Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to support a summer REU program to be                
              held in the Department of Biomedical Sciences (BMS) of the State               
              University of New York at Albany's School of Public Health.  The               
              participating faculty members in this department are also                      
              Research Scientists within the Wadsworth Center for Laboratories               
              and Research (WCL&R) of the New York State Health Department.                  
              The WCL&R is a unique laboratory with state-of-the-art                         
              facilities, in which basic research programs have developed                    
              alongside mission-oriented public health laboratories.  The                    
              research interests of the participating BMS faculty cover a broad              
              range, with emphasis in molecular genetics and structural                      
              biology.  Ten undergraduate students interested in research                    
              careers will be recruited from colleges in the Northeast and from              
              historically Black colleges in the South.  Recruitment of under-               
              represented minority students will be assisted by the Director of              
              the Office of Minority Affairs, as part of this University's                   
              ongoing initiative in the area of minority graduate education.                 
              Laboratory projects in basic biological research topics will be                
              chosen that are interesting, likely to yield results within the                
              time-frame of the program, and allow for some degree of student                
              development and independence.  Weekly group meetings will be used              
              to discuss science- and career-related issues and to monitor                   
              student progress.  The students will be asked to make both                     
              written and oral presentations to stress the importance of                     
              communication skills within science.
