Abstract    :
                   Nitrogen fixation is an important component of the nitrogen               
              cycle in the sea.  Presently, it appears that the colonial                     
              cyanobacterium Trichodesmium is the major diazotroph in the                    
              euphotic zone of the open ocean.  A number of other species could              
              potentially contribute significantly to the fixation of N2, but                
              may have escaped attention due to the difficulties of culture and              
              the measurement of N2-fixation in situ.  In this project, Dr.                  
              Zehr and collaborators will present a new approach to the                      
              detection and characterization of N2-fixing microorganisms in the              
              marine environment.  They will use a very sensitive molecular                  
              technique, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to identify and                
              characterize nitrogen-fixing genes in a variety of marine                      
              environments.  The use of this technique will settle a number of               
              long-standing issues of the presence of N2-fixation potential i                
              planktonic and benthic environments.  Furthermore, the product of              
              this research will be a DNA sequence database and cloned nif                   
              genes which can be used for detailed investigations of the                     
              ecological diversity of N2-fixing microorganisms in the sea.
