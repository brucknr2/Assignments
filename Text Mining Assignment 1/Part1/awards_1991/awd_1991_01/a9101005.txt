Abstract    :
              This program is a continuation of support for a REU site in the                
              Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Notre Dame.               
              The support for 10 undergraduate students each year allows them to             
              become involved in the research activities of the faculty of the               
              Department and provides students with an improved understanding of             
              research and encourages them to consider careers in research.  The             
              research activities span the areas of expertise of the faculty in              
              civil engineering and includes projects in water resources,                    
              bioengineering and pollution control, and structural mechanics.                
              Components of the program include identification of exceptional                
              students through nationwide recruitment with emphasis on women and             
              minority participation; matching of student research interests with            
              faculty; close interaction of graduate students and faculty with               
              the undergraduates to provide students with a fuller appreciation              
              of graduate study, university research, and careers in academia;               
              an intense two month research experience; mini-courses, as needed,             
              to facilitate effectiveness in the research projects; and a mini-              
              conference for presentation of results.  The goal of the program               
              is to excite some of the best engineering students in the nation               
              about the challenges of a career in research.
