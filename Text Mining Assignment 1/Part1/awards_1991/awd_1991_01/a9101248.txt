Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Shrub invasions into grassland cause long term changes in plant                
              community structure that are indicative of desertification in the              
              southwestern United States.  Shrub replacement of grassland may                
              also influence the dynamics of ecosystem nutrient cycling.  Both               
              the longevity of desert shrubs and the long term accumulation of               
              soil nutrients under desert shrubs in "islands of fertility" may               
              act in tandem as a positive biological feedback for continued                  
              desertification.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This study combines state-of-the-art stable isotope techniques with            
              traditional soil science and plant ecology methods to address the              
              following questions: 1) Which soil nutrients comprise an island of             
              fertility?; 2) Do biotically-regulated soil nutrients become more              
              spatially heterogeneous over time as desertification proceeds?; 3)             
              How does shrub presence or absence affect rates of island of                   
              fertility formation and degradation?; and 4) Does soil nutrient                
              concentration correlate to the degree of island of fertility                   
              development and has C3 shrubland recently replaced C4 grassland at             
              the Sevilleta NWR, New Mexico?                                                 
                                                                                             
              Answers from this research will provide valuable insight towards               
              a more complete understanding of the dynamics of desertification               
              in the southwestern United States.
