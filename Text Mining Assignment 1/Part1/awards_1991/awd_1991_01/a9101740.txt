Abstract    :
                   This project concerns research on generalized special                     
              functions, defined on matrix spaces and on domains of positivity.              
              Part of the project will be to develop the fine structure of the               
              scalar- and operator-valued generalized hypergeometric functions               
              defined on general domains of positivity.  The other part of the               
              project will be to develop applications of the generalized special             
              functions to the theory of total positivity and to mathematical                
              statistics.                                                                    
                   This research deals with the general foundations of the                   
              hypergeometric functions on the space of matrices.  The work has               
              applications to combinatorics in the classical invariant theory and            
              the development of polynomial identities, applications to physics              
              in the hypergeometric functions in the matrix arguments in quantum             
              field theory, and applications to statistics in statistical                    
              inference for the 'natural exponential family' of probability                  
              distributions.
