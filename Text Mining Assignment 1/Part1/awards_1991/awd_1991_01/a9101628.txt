Abstract    :
                   This project consists of a series of numerical experiments                
              designed to increase understanding of the internal variability of              
              the climate system.  It is necessary to have accurate estimates                
              of the internal variability in order to identify climate signals               
              produced by external forcing.  The experiment will employ state                
              of the art but relatively low resolution climate simulation                    
              models.  The main component for the initial experiments is an                  
              atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) with a realistic but               
              non-interactive biosphere.  A coupled ocean-atmosphere-biosphere               
              model will used in the following stages of the investigation.                  
              The experiments will be integrations of the numerical models for               
              periods on the order of 1000 years.  The data produced by the                  
              integrations will be reduced and analyzed by a variety of                      
              statistical diagnostic techniques.  The result of the experiments              
              will advance knowledge of internal variability by using models                 
              that are in some ways better and that are run longer than in                   
              previous work.                                                                 
                   This project is funded under the NSF Climate Modeling,                    
              Analysis and Prediction initiative of the Global Change Research
