Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PI's will study the variation of stable carbon and                    
              oxygen isotope contents in planktonic and benthic foraminifera                 
              from two Eocene/Oligocene sequences (DSDP core 522) in the                     
              South Atlantic and one core (DSDP core 748) in the southern                    
              Indian Ocean to determine if early Oligocene ice-sheets on                     
              Antarctica displayed the same waxing and waning as seen during                 
              the Neogene. If so, was the signal the same or different in                    
              amplitude/frequency; i.e. does tyhe earliest Oligocene record                  
              display Milankovitch rhthyms? This study is facilitated by the                 
              improvement in Paleogene stratigraphy, particularly chemo-and-                 
              magneto-stratigraphies.
