Abstract    :
              Machine-readable dictionaries (MRD's) contain knowledge about                  
              language and the world essential for large-scale tasks in natural              
              language processing (NLP).  This knowledge, however, collected                 
              and recorded by lexicographers for human readers, in not                       
              presented in a principled enough manner for MRD's to be used                   
              directly as tools for NLP tasks.  What the NLP research community              
              needs is machine tractable dictionaries (MTD's); that is MRD's                 
              transformed into a format for NLP tasks.  Previous work has                    
              developed a range of tools for extracting information from MRD's               
              for NLP tasks in general.  This work will combine these methods                
              based on their respective strengths.  It will define the SPIRAL                
              methodology which combines various elements of the three methods               
              into a single coherent procedure.  Different forms of knowledge                
              are derived from each individual method and each is incomplete in              
              certain respects; yet the combination of the three yields better               
              results than could any individual method.  In particular, the                  
              goal is to construct an MTD as a data-base of lexical facts,                   
              together with a network of statistically-related word sense.  The              
              MTD will support the automatic construction of lexicons for many               
              types of NLP systems, form those using traditional methods based               
              on syntax and semantics to those based wholly on statistical                   
              methods.
