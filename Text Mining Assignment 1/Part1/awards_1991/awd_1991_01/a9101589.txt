Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Further development of an interactive software product to aid                  
              in the building of model proteins is proposed.  Dr. Lee                        
              proposes to refine, incorporate, and test four new algorithms                  
              in the program.  The first is the incorporation of secondary                   
              structure information into the algorithm for the automatic                     
              locations of conserved regions in the proteins.  It will                       
              prevent inappropriate sections of the reference proteins from                  
              being classified as being conserved.  The second is the adding                 
              of a method for generating loops in the variable regions.  They                
              will be more random in nature than those currently found in a                  
              structural database, and will span more of conformational                      
              space.  The third is an algorithm for systematically searching                 
              possible conformations for side chains.  It will help find a                   
              set of self-consistent rotamers that pack well.  The fourth is                 
              an algorithm to incorporate low resolution crystal data into                   
              the model.  It uses simulated annealing using x-carbon                         
              coordinates as distance constraints to find a folded protein                   
              conformation with little input structural information.  It can                 
              also be applied in a more limited way as an adjunct to other                   
              model building methods.  Taken together, these new methods will                
              be of great use to the researchers who use the software                        
              product.
