Abstract    :
              The coordination chemistry of dinuclear cationic transition                    
              metal complexes of molybdenum and tungsten  with formal charges                
              of four to ten will be explored through synthesis and                          
              structural methods.  Kinetic and mechanistic studies of ligand                 
              substitution reactions and the organometallic chemistry of                     
              dinuclear metal centers will be initiated.  These results may                  
              differ substantially from the thoroughly investigated                          
              mononuclear complexes due to the influence of the metal-metal                  
              bond.  Ordered assemblies such as liquid crystals and polymers                 
              formed by use of dinuclear metal multiple bonds as building                    
              blocks will be investigated, with emphasis on the controllable                 
              magnetic, optical, and electronic properties of these                          
              macromolecular systems.  The dinuclear precursors have first                   
              ionization potentials that vary by two volts depending on metal                
              and the substituents; these features should allow a large array                
              of macromolecular systems with tunable electronic properties.

              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Malcolm                  
              H. Chisholm of Indiana University will continue his studies of                 
              the rich chemistry of dinuclear complexes of molybdenum and                    
              tungsten.  These molecules show considerable promise as                        
              homogeneous catalysts.  In addition, they can be assembled                     
              under proper conditions to form liquid crystals and polymers                   
              that may have useful properties as new materials.
