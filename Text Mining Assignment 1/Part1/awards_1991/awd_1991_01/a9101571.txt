Abstract    :
                   This project is an international collaboration between US,                
              Canadian and USSR scientists focusing on the effects of Russian                
              expansion into the Siberian taiga on a group of reindeer herders,              
              the Evenks.  The recent expansion of the trans-Siberian railroad               
              has had major ecological effects on these people, including the                
              introduction of a number of diseases, nutritional changes and the              
              economic buildup of the areas around the tracks.  The two-year                 
              research program will consist of field work in the Surrinda                    
              village of the Baikit region of the Central Siberian Plateau.                  
              Subsistence ecology, demographic analysis, activity patterns,                  
              genetics, health and nutritional status will be assessed from a                
              sample of the Evenks.  The project will provide baseline data on               
              the ecology and human genetics of a Siberian indigenous                        
              population, may contribute to our understanding of the peopling                
              of the New World, and will provide a better understanding of the               
              effects of technology and westernization on small, indigenous                  
              populations of reindeer herders.  Such information will help                   
              administrators concerned with economic development to make more                
              enlightened decisions.
