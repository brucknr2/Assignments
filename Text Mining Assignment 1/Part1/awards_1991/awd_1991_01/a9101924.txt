Abstract    :
              Dr. Robin L. McCarley has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                 
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. McCarley's doctoral degree was                    
              from the University of North Carolina under the supervision of                 
              Professor Royce Murray. Dr. McCarley will continue research at                 
              the University of Texas-Austin under the sponsorship of Dr.                    
              Allen Bard. Dr. McCarley's postdoctoral research will involve                  
              the use of scanning tunneling microscopy to image biological                   
              species on surfaces.  Longer term, he plans to focus on the                    
              molecular engineering of surfaces involved in electrochemical                  
              processes.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
