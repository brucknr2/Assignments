Abstract    :
              This applicant proposes to construct and test a new kind of probe              
              to be used to enhance near-field optical microscopy.  More                     
              specifically, the work will focus on construction of a submicron               
              probe based on a Schottky barrier diode.   The work is planned to              
              take place in the laboratory of Dr. Carlos Bustamante at the                   
              University of Oregon.
