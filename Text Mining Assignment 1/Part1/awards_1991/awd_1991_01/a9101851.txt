Abstract    :
                   This is a grant for partial support of a Workshop on                      
              Intelligent Computer-Aided Design; Columbus, Ohio; September 30                
              through October 3, 1991.  The working conference aims to provide               
              a forum for the exchange of ideas and experiences related to the               
              use of Artificial Intelligence techniques in Computer-Aided Design             
              (CAD).  Participants will present and explore the state-of-the-art             
              of Intelligent CAD systems, try to delineate future directions in              
              both research and practice, and discuss ways to promote further                
              developments.
