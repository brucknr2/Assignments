Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The history of the Central American avifauna will be addressed                 
              using molecular methods and methods of vicariance biogeography.                
              The relatively well known history of southern Central America                  
              makes it appropriate for using the vicariance approach to avian                
              biogeographic analysis.  Starch-gel electrophoresis of proteins                
              and analyses of nucleic acids (amplification and sequencing of                 
              specific regions of the genome) will be used to estimate                       
              phylogenetic relationships among Central American endemic taxa                 
              and their South American sister taxa.  Specific hypotheses                     
              concerning the evolution of Central American taxa will be tested               
              by comparing these phylogenies.  Levels of genetic                             
              differentiation will be used to assess relative ages of splitting              
              events of South and Central American highland and lowland taxa.
