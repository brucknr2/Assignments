Abstract    :
              The project is concerned with three related objectives:                         
                                                                                            
              Objective 1.  Develop data structures and efficient algorithms                 
              for the exact symbolic computation of approximate solutions of                 
              differential equations.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Objective 2.  Apply these algorithms to develop mixed symbolic-                
              numeric integration schemes to integrate trajectories of                       
              nonlinear systems.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Objective 3.  Apply these algorithms and schemes to problems in                
              bifurcation theory, normal forms, and nonlinear realization                    
              theory.                                                                        
                   In the long term, new algorithms in this area will impact                 
              technology by leading to the design of better robots, aircraft                 
              and satellites.
