Abstract    :
              Bhattacharya         This research is on:  1.     hierarchical fault simulation
              in coarse-grain MIMD parallel  computers or distributed systems; and  2.    
              parallel test generation on MIMD parallel machines with and  without shared
              memory.          An investigation of two-dimensional circuit partitioning 
              leading to two-dimensional, loosely-coupled, pipeline-like  information flow in
              a distributed memory parallel computer, and  partitioning of circuits employing
              partial scan design  methodologies is being explored.  Formal methods to
              analyze the  computational complexity of the resultant parallel algorithms are 
              being formulated.  Implementations are being tested using  industrial size
              benchmark circuits.          A BDD-based approach is being taken for test
              generation.   This has advantages in generating tests for large combinational 
              circuits and sequential circuits.  Algorithms are being explored  for machines
              with shared memory, and for distributed-memory MIMD  machines.  Also being
              investigated are the generalization of  BDD's to multi-valued decision
              diagrams, and the use of BDD-based  test generation in a hierarchical design
              framework.
