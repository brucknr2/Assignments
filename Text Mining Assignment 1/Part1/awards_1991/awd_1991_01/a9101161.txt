Abstract    :
                   This project will study regularity and solvability                        
              of linear partial differential equations related to several                    
              complex variables. This will include local and global                          
              solvability, existence and regularity of solutions to the                      
              Cauchy-Riemann and tangential Cauchy-Riemann problems, the closed              
              range property and local embeddability of Cauchy-Riemann                       
              operators, analytic hypoellipticity of operators, and CR                       
              functions.                                                                     
                   Results from this project will contribute to understanding                
              fundamental behavior of equations arising in science and                       
              engineering.
