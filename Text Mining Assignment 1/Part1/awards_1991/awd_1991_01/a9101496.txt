Abstract    :
                   Professor Xia will study the C*-algebras of random singular               
              integral operators and Toeplitz operators associated with n-                   
              dimensional flows.  He will analyze the ideal structure in these               
              algebras and address questions such as their solvability.  He will             
              compute the K-groups of certain important sub-C*-algebras and their            
              ideals with the goal of classifying these kinds of algebras.                   
                   Professor Xia's project deals with C*-algebras.  These                    
              algebras are families of Hilbert space operators each of which can             
              be thought of as an infinite matrix of complex numbers.  The                   
              algebras which Professor Xia will consider consist of operators                
              which arise in more applied fields such as the study of partial                
              differential equations.
