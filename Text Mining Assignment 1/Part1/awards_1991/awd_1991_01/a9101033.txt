Abstract    :
              In this project, PI's will study the dispersion of Mediterranean               
              Water into the North Atlantic by seeding the Mediterranean                     
              Undercurrent near its source with lagrangian drifters.  Forty                  
              RAFOS floats will be tracked for a period of eighteen months, with             
              the principal objective of distinguishing between the formation of             
              Mediterranean mesoscale eddies (Meddies), and simple advection/                
              diffusion.  In a collaborative study, scientists from Portugal                 
              will carry out hydrographic surveys and maintain an array of                   
              current meters in the region.
