Abstract    :
                   Professor Price will consider some questions in the theory of             
              operator algebras related to the index theory for semigroups of                
              endomorphisms.  In this work Professor Price will continue his work            
              with Jorgensen on their extension of the Arveson-Powers index to a             
              setting which assigns an index to certain derivations on operator              
              algebras.  He expects to continue his work with Powers on a related            
              problem of analyzing the generator extensions of the second                    
              quantization of a symmetric unbounded operator.  He also will study            
              isomorphism invariants for a class of operator algebras whose                  
              structure resembles that of a one parameter family of Cuntz                    
              algebras.  Finally Price will continue his project of acquainting              
              undergraduates with certain research topics involving operator                 
              algebras.                                                                      
                   Professor Price's project involves self-adjoint operator                  
              algebras.  These objects consist of families of Hilbert space                  
              operators (infinite matrices of complex numbers) which have an                 
              interesting property: the algebra is generated by operators whose              
              value in any state on the algebra is a real number.  This property             
              makes these algebras important for physics and indeed physics was              
              the original motivation for their study.
