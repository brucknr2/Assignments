Abstract    :
                   This group of researchers will continue to study various                  
              problems in the theory of continuous parameter Markov processes                
              at both the general level and the specific level (especially in                
              connection with stable processes), stochastic calculus and                     
              potential theory.  The potential theory associated with excessive              
              measures, capacities and related objects has been a subject of                 
              continuing interest to Fitzsimmons and Getoor, and they expect to              
              further their investigations in this area.
