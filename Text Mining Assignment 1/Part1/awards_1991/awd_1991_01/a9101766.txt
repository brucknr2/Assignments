Abstract    :
              Efforts will be made to correct various deficiencies in our                    
              knowledge of transition metal hydride complexes.  The question                 
              of whether H-H distances intermediate between the short                        
              (dihydrogen) and long (classical hydrides) are possible will be                
              addressed experimentally.  Relative reactivities of the three                  
              types of hydrides will be examined with respect to                             
              deprotonation, loss of hydrogen, and fluxional exchange with                   
              terminal hydrogens.  Synthetic efforts aimed at stabilizing the                
              theoretically predicted trihydrogen complex will be initiated.                 
              Studies of strong X-H and X-X interactions within the                          
              coordination sphere of the complex, fluxionality mechanisms,                   
              and preparative studies will be continued.

              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Robert H.                
              Crabtree of Yale University will continue studies of transition                
              metal hydride complexes.  These complexes are very likely                      
              important intermediates in catalytic hydrogenation reactions.                  
              The knowledge gained through these studies may have                            
              implications in the important areas of catalysis and energy                    
              storage.
