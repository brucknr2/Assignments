Abstract    :
                   Professor Clancey will study the matrix function theory of                
              closed Riemann surfaces.  Specifically, he will investigate                    
              problems in interpolation of zero-pole data and interpolation of               
              values with bounds (Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation).  These problems            
              are important in real world questions and the research will attempt            
              to provide explicit solutions.                                                 
                   Professor Clancey's research is on the interface between the              
              theory of complex valued differentiable functions and the theory of            
              Hilbert space operators.  Hilbert space operators are essentially              
              infinite matrices of complex numbers.  These operators have                    
              applications in every area of applied science as well as in pure               
              mathematics.  This type of research is an attempt to classify                  
              certain important families of such objects.
