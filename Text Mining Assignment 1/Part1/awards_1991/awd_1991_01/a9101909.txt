Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The subpolar open seas are under scrutiny for the role they may                
              play in the global carbon dioxide (CO2) cycle. While the level                 
              of biological production and the fate of that production are                   
              central issues in the inquiry, the mechanisms controlling even                 
              the level of biological production in the subpolar open seas are               
              not understood.  This project will reformulate an ecosystem                    
              process model integrating a biological model of lower trophic                  
              level interactions, including phytoplankton production, grazing,               
              and nutrient regeneration, into a one-dimensional physical model               
              of the upper ocean.  The model will be developed and first tested              
              against the extensive physical and biological observations from                
              Ocean Station P (50 Degrees N 145 Degrees W) in the open                       
              subarctic Pacific Ocean.  Effects of physical-biological                       
              interactions and trophic complexity will be assessed.  The model               
              will then be applied to the other two subpolar open seas, the                  
              subarctic Atlantic and the subantarctic circumpolar ocean which,               
              because of biological and physical processes favorable to removal              
              of CO2 from the surface layer and its sequestration in the deep                
              ocean, are thought to play a major role in the global CO2 cycle.
