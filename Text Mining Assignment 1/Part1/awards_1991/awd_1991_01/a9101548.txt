Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator will study statistical methods.  These              
              involve the optimal choices of sequences of binary questions for               
              problems of classification,  probability class estimation,                     
              regression, and survival analysis.  Much of the computer-                      
              intensive research that is planned involves new capabilities and               
              significant improvements of the algorithms and techniques given                
              by Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone in Classification and                  
              Regression Trees and its associated CART software.  Some                       
              computations will be done in an innovative distributed mode on a               
              system of workstations.  The investigators plan applications to                
              test data sets, particularly a large data set concerning the                   
              quick diagnosis of heart attack.  Details are given for an                     
              application to the enhancement of certain magnetic resonance                   
              images that are important to making prognoses for patients with                
              lymphoma.  (Support is not requested for the conduct of clinical               
              trials; indeed, the data do not arise from conventional clinical               
              trials.)  The statistics research involved is of importance to a               
              wide variety of applications, some of them medical.
