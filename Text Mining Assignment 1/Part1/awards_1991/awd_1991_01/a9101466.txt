Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              New profiles of rare earth elements (REE) and Ce oxidation rate                
              measurements in the Sargasso Sea point to a time variable upper                
              ocean redox cycle of cerium.  This cycle is complexly linked to                
              biological and light-mediated reactions, input from dust and                   
              rain and thermal stratification.  In order to understand the                   
              biogeochemical processes operating on REE and Ce redox                         
              transformation in the upper oceans, a comprehensive time-series                
              study at the BATS GOFS site in the Sargasso Sea will be                        
              conducted.  This will be complemented with measurements of REE                 
              in rainwater, atmospheric particles and upper waters of the N.                 
              Atlantic Ocean.
