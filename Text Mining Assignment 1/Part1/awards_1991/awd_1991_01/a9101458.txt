Abstract    :
                   Professor Ruh will investigate some problems in Riemannian                
              geometry by using techniques of deformation theory. In particular,             
              he will study deformation of metrics, connections, and curvature.              
              The general goal is to obtain optimal structures on manifolds in               
              order to draw conclusions about the geometry of the manifold.                  
              Professor Ruh will consider the deformation of almost Lie groups               
              into Lie groups and the deformation of general Riemannian metrics              
              into metrics with prescribed curvature conditions. The foundation              
              of deformation theory lies in partial differential equations and               
              the heat equation in particular.                                               
                   One underlying theme which has turned out to be extremely                 
              useful in mathematics is that of deformation to a desired                      
              structure. In order to obtain an optimal structure it is often                 
              useful to construct a structure which has some of the desired                  
              properties but not all of them. One then seeks to "deform" the                 
              initial structure to one with the desired properties. The mechanism            
              used to make the deformation should preserve at least those aspects            
              of the desired structure which one was able to attain as a first               
              step.
