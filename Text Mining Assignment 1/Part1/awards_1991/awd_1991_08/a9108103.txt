Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program, to be carried out by one of the world's leading                  
              theoretical astrophysicists, will use modern grid-based hydrocodes,            
              adapted from successful aerodynamic codes to study large-scale                 
              cosmic structure, and the infall of matter onto compact objects.               
              True hydrodynamic computational methods have been developed, which             
              can treat shocks and radiative processes, and which will permit the            
              direct calculation of X-ray emission, fluctuations in the cosmic               
              background radiation, and other phenomena not previously accessible            
              from numerical approaches.
