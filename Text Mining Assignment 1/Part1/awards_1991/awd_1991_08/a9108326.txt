Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Callis of Montana State                       
              University will study the lowest-lying electronic states of                    
              indoles using experimental and theoretical methods.  The                       
              experiments will range from gas-phase to condensed-phase                       
              spectroscopic studies, and the calculations will use a                         
              semi-empirical theory which incorporates solute-solvent                        
              interactions.  These studies of indoles are of interest because                
              indoles constitute the chromophore of the amino acid                           
              tryptophan, and an analysis of their spectra can help elucidate                
              the effect of the solvent and protein environment on the                       
              electronic state energies and dynamics of the chromophores.

              In recent years many studies have sought to understand the                     
              fundamental functions of the molecular species involved in the                 
              chemistry of living organisms.  The current work will attempt                  
              to understand how the photochemically active constituent of the                
              amino acid tryptophan might contribute to the functioning of                   
              proteins and enzymes which contain it.  Such studies could have                
              far-reaching effects.  For example, recent work suggests that                  
              tryptophans may play an important role in modulating and                       
              directing large scale motions in proteins such as the enzyme                   
              lysozyme.
