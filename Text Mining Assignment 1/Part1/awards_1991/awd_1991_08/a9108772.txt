Abstract    :
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                     
              (EPSCoR) in the state of South Carolina will enhance the                       
              research competitiveness of 59 targeted faculty working in 8                   
              research areas at Clemson University and the University of                     
              South Carolina.  The eight research clusters are                               
              concentrated in the areas of biological sciences, materials                    
              science, and computational sciences.  They are: (1)                            
              Molecular Genetics, Genome Mapping, and Gene Manipulation;                     
              (2) Program in Molecular and Population Biology; (3) High                      
              Speed Digital Neural Networks; (4) Global Research Change:                     
              Integrating Observational and Modeling Approaches; (5)                         
              Fibers and Micromechanics of their Composites; (6) Materials                   
              Science at the University of South Carolina; (7) Innovation                    
              Through Chemical Synthesis: Novel Molecules and Materials;                     
              and (8) Industrial Mathematics Initiative.  South Carolina                     
              EPSCoR has three major objectives to effect permanent                          
              improvements in the State's education and research                             
              environment.  They are: faculty development, human resource                    
              development, and bridging of State/Industry/University S&E                     
              interests.  Strategies include the addition of ten new                         
              faculty, six classified support staff, support for 40                          
              graduate students per year, and expansion of the State                         
              EPSCoR Committee.  The State of South Carolina, its                            
              institutions, and its private sector have contributed over                     
              $6 million in non-federal matching funds to this three year                    
              EPSCoR effort.
