Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project involves the dissertation research of a                  
              graduate student in ethno-botanical anthropology who will study                
              how members of a Mayan Indian community in southern Mexico select              
              medicinal plants.  The project, based on participant observation,              
              field surveys for plants, structured interviewing and                          
              lexicographic techniques, represents an in-depth study of the                  
              information Mayan Indians need to identify medicinal plants.  The              
              researcher will collect medicinal plants with expert Mayan                     
              Indians, questioning them as they select (and reject) plants for               
              their pharmacological efficacy.  In addition expert Indian plant               
              collectors will be asked to define the characteristics of an                   
              already collected set of medicinal plants.  The end result will                
              be an in-depth analysis of the cognitive as well as botanical                  
              aspects of Mayan Indian medicinal plant use.  The dissertation                 
              research is in collaboration with other research on the                        
              ethnomedicine of Indians in this area, and will contribute to and              
              benefit from this other research.                                              
                                                                                             
              This research is important because understanding how people with               
              a vibrant natural system of medicinal plant use select plants for              
              specific illnesses will advance our knowledge of basic human                   
              cognition about health care, and of the medicinal attributes of                
              plants in this area.  Recording and preserving indigenous                      
              ethnobotanical and ethnomedical knowledge is an important part of              
              preserving global biodiversity.
