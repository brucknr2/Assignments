Abstract    :
              This project addresses the problem of writing parallel programs that           
              are simultaneously clear, portable, and efficient.  The initial focus          
              is on MIMD multiprocessors, including various shared memory and                
              distributed memory architectures.  The approach separates the                  
              expression of a parallel algorithm from the machine-dependent details          
              that are necessary to achieve good performance.  A programmer first            
              writes an algorithm in a classic, explicitly parallel style assuming           
              there is unlimited concurrency and that objects are shared.  This              
              basic algorithm is then annotated with scheduling directives and data          
              mappings to yield an efficient program.  The annotations thus affect           
              the performance of the algorithm on a given architecture but they do           
              not affect its correctness.  A new, object-oriented programming                
              language that supports this method has been developed.  This project           
              is refining the language and approach by examining additional parallel         
              computing problems, conducting experiments to assess its performance,          
              and determining the extent to which this approach can be applied to            
              existing languages and to SIMD architectures.
