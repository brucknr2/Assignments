Abstract    :
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                     
              (EPSCoR) in the state of Mississippi will enhance the                          
              research competitiveness of approximately 20 researchers                       
              from institutions of the Mississippi Research Consortium                       
              (MRC).  MRC is a coalition formed in November 1986 by                          
              Mississippi's four largest institutions of higher learning:                    
              Mississippi State University, Jackson State University, the                    
              University of Mississippi, and the University of Southern                      
              Mississippi.  The researchers are organized in three                           
              research clusters focused on the broad disciplines of                          
              chemistry/materials science.  The research areas are:  (1)                     
              Composite Materials; (2) Advanced Polymeric Materials                          
              Laboratory; and (3) Structure and Dynamic Analysis.  The                       
              Mississippi EPSCoR Project is a major catalyst for the                         
              creation of a mechanism to develop a functional state-wide                     
              research infrastructure.  The chief research officers                          
              constitute the Board of both the Consortium and the EPSCoR                     
              Executive Committee.  The cooperation among the state's                        
              research institutions has resulted in a demonstrated                           
              successful cooperative research effort, the sharing of                         
              expertise and scientific equipment, and the coordination of                    
              efforts to address major projects.  This collaboration among                   
              the universities has created opportunities for stronger                        
              interaction with state, federal, and private entities.  The                    
              state has committed in excess of $11 million as an                             
              investment in EPSCoR's objectives for the duration of this                     
              three-year award.
