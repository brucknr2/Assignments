Abstract    :
              This SGER award will provide immediate travel funds for a                      
              graduate student of the PI to go study the ongoing eruption of                 
              Hecla volcano.  Hecla started erupting on January 17, 1991 and                 
              the PI and his student are particularly interested in making                   
              real-time observations and collecting samples because of their                 
              particular interest in the chemistry and dynamics of flood basalt              
              eruptions.
