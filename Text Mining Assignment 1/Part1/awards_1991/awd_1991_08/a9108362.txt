Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project comprises a long-term investigation of the capacity               
              of various components of a desert stream ecosystem to respond to               
              a disturbance which itself varies with interannual variation in                
              climate.  Climate interacts with this ecosystem by providing,                  
              through runoff, both water and nutrients to the stream channel.                
              In particular, nitrogen, a key element in desert ecosystems,                   
              varies in stream water as a function of extended (several years)               
              dry or wet periods.  Nitrogen availability has a strong influence              
              on both algal succession and the capacity of invertebrates to                  
              recover after disturbance.  Climatic forcers affecting                         
              precipitation and runoff provide the predominant form of                       
              disturbance in this ecosystem, flash floods and drought.                       
              Therefore, climate, by influencing precipitation,                              
              evapotranspiration, and resulting runoff, both alters inputs of                
              essential materials to the ecosystem and is a major disrupter of               
              biotic structure.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Both the mechanisms of terrestrial-aquatic linkage and                         
              interannual patterns of disturbance response in Sycamore Creek,                
              Arizona, will be studied using a combination of manipulative and               
              experimental approaches.  This research will rely heavily upon                 
              and will extend an existing long-term database describing                      
              structure and functioning of this ecosystem.
