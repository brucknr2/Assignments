Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Neumark will study the                              
              photodissociation spectroscopy of free radicals, coordinatively                
              unsaturated organometallic radicals, and neutral cluster                       
              species in order to obtain information on bond energies and on                 
              the photodissociation dynamics.  For each system the                           
              dissociative electronic states will be mapped out by measuring                 
              the photodissociation cross section as a function of frequency.                
              This will be followed by photodissociation dynamics experiments                
              in which the photofragment energy and angular distributions are                
              measured and the bond dissociation energies are determined.

              Free radicals play a vital role in chemistry as primary                        
              reactants and reactive intermediates.  These experiments will                  
              look at the different spectroscopy and dynamics between                        
              molecules with open shell electronic structures and those with                 
              closed shells.  Such information bears directly on the chemical                
              reactivity of free radicals.
