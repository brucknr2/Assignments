Abstract    :
                   Fundamental problems involving the interactions of                        
              photons and electrons with atoms and negative ions either in                   
              the free state or in the presence of strong static electric or                 
              magnetic fields will be studied theoretically.  Physical                       
              processes to be studied include multiphoton detachment of                      
              negative ions in the presence of strong static electric                        
              fields, resonant photoionization of Be, electron impact                        
              ionization of H and He, multiphoton processes in H, Ar and F-,                 
              and photoionization of H in a strong, uniform magnetic field.
