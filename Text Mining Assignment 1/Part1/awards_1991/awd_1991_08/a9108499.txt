Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is to provide some travel support for the participants              
              of symposium entitled "Strategies for Analyzing Neuropeptide                   
              Systems" to be held at the annual meeting of American Society of               
              Zoologists, December 27th to 30th, 1991, in Atlanta, Georgia.                  
              The focus of the symposium is on cellular and molecular                        
              approaches associated with neuropeptide systems.  The aim is to                
              provide a broad comparative scope and stress the applications of               
              these valuable techniques for the specific needs of the diverse                
              audience that attends this meeting.  A roundtable discussion                   
              following the presentations will be used to evaluate and                       
              integrate the research strategies presented by the speakers.                   
              The participants represent a group of young investigators who are              
              directly active in the research and are establishing their own                 
              outstanding careers in this rapidly advancing area of                          
              neurobiology.  The proceedings of the symposium will be published              
              in the American Zoologist and, thus, accessible to scientists                  
              that did not attend this meeting but would benefit from a review               
              of the state-of-the-art approaches and techniques available to                 
              tackle important biological problems.  Finally, this symposium                 
              will be used to test the feasibility of forming a                              
              multidisciplinary division of neuroscience within the American                 
              Society of Zoologists.
