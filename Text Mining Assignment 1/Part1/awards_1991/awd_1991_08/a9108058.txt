Abstract    :
              Many operations in engineering and resource management encounter               
              optimization problems, that is, mathematical problems of choosing              
              optimally several factors that affect a productivity index.  These are         
              problems of considerable computational difficulty that have been               
              extensively investigated in the last three decades.  This project              
              focuses on several such problems that have a network structure, and it         
              relates to a class of recently proposed methods called auction and             
              relaxation algorithms.  The problems to be addressed range from the            
              classical assignment, transportation, transshipment, and shortest path         
              problems to some new types of multiassignment problems.  These                 
              problems arise very often in practice and their size is often very             
              large.  Methodological improvements for the solution of these problems         
              will have significant practical impact.                                        
                                                                                             
              The investigation will aim at the understanding of the performance of          
              existing network algorithms and will develop algorithms with improved          
              performance based on auction and relation ideas.
