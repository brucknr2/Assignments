Abstract    :
              Under a Research Planning Grant, initial steps are to be taken                 
              for the development of a numerical code which would produce                    
              visual animation of computed unsteady separation of flow from                  
              solid surfaces.  The formulation is one which couples the                      
              animation directly to the flow computation, to follow it as                    
              the computed flow evolves.  The computation will be fully                      
              viscous, eventually three dimensional, and unsteady.                           
              Realistic dynamic representation of simulated flow separation                  
              phenomena will be of great utility in comparing simulated and                  
              experimental results and contribute to the ability to more                     
              reliably predict this complex flow phenomenon.
