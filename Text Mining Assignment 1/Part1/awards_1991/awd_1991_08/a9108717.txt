Abstract    :
              Since the late 1970's, increasing international competition,                   
              technological change, a deep recession, and changes in the                     
              composition of demand haver led to the displacement of millions of             
              workers from their jobs because of plant closings or large-scale               
              reductions in operations.  The adaptability of displaced workers,              
              is an important component of the economy's overall response to                 
              structural change.  The purpose of this project is to analyze the              
              determinants of industrial and occupational mobility and post-                 
              displacement joblessness and earnings.  Differences between blacks             
              and whites in industrial and occupational mobility will also be                
              examined.  The study will analyze job search with a two sector                 
              model which will be estimated using data from the Displaced Worker             
              Surveys.  Questions of industrial and occupational change introduce            
              sample selection issues and these concerns will be addressed in the            
              empirical analysis.  This research is supported under the Research             
              at Undergraduate Institutions Program, and the project is important            
              because it may provide new insights for the design of labor market             
              policies.
