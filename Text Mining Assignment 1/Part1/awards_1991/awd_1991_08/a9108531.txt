Abstract    :
                   The beam physics of soft vacuum generated electrons, the                  
              plasma chemistry of hardening and dry development and electron-                
              induce polymer changes will be examined in a unified manner.  Soft             
              vacuum electron beam sources will be characterized, fully                      
              accounting for modification of the beam energy spectrum by the                 
              background gas.  Both well known, electron-sensitive polymers and              
              new polymers will be processed using appropriate gaseous media that            
              enhance polymer surface chemistry and gasification reactions.                  
                   The techniques promises to increase the curing speed and                  
              pattern resolution of the semiconductor resist patterns which are              
              used in microelectronic processing.  This may allow increased                  
              circuit density.  Applications in electronic and semiconductor                 
              manufacturing will be explored with industrial collaborators.
