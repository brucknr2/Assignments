Abstract    :
              This award supports continued cooperative research between Dr.                 
              Hans R. Bilger of Oklahoma State University and Dr. G.E. Stedman               
              of the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, to complete                     
              construction and attain operation of a plane, square 1 m2  high-               
              resolution ringlaser and of a prototype of a slightly smaller ring             
              (898 mm X 837 mm) at the University of Canterbury, and to use the              
              instrument to measure geophysical effects such as seismic action               
              and earth tides.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The collaboration, begun in 1989 under award number INT 89-00033,              
              is a productive blend of the experimental skills of Dr. Bilger                 
              with the more theoretical interests of Dr. Stedman regarding the               
              use of ringlasers to measure geophysical, atomic spectroscopic,                
              and general relativistic effects.  Sensing and recording earth                 
              tides and seismic activity with a ringlaser is novel, and should               
              significantly advance assessment of the instrument to these                    
              applications.  In addition, the site of the ringlaser should allow             
              more exact measurement of seismic activities from the nearby, very             
              active, Pacific Plate-Indian Plate boundary.
