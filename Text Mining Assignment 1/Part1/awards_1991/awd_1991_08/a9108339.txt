Abstract    :
                   This research examines probability limits over classes of                 
              sets and functions.  Empirical measures can be applied to sets or              
              to functions to define empirical processes.  Earlier results in                
              empirical process theory established that convergence in                       
              distribution to a Gaussian holds uniformly for certain classes of              
              sets and functions.  This research seeks to find larger classes                
              of sets for which statistical functionals are differentiable and               
              therefore can be approximated by a process with this convergence               
              property, plus a remainder of lower order.
