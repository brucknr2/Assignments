Abstract    :
                   Research will be directed towards developing more                         
              accurate methods for the calculation of molecular vibrational                  
              excitation cross sections for electron scattering at low                       
              energies.  A new method of calculation, the first-order,                       
              non-degenerate adiabatic method, which was previously used to                  
              provide improved cross sections for vibrational excitation of                  
              hydrogen will be extended to permit calculations on more                       
              complex molecules.  Calculations will be compared with                         
              experimental results.
