Abstract    :
                   Understanding factors that control production of supercooled              
              liquid water in mountainous terrain is not only an important                   
              fundamental research question, but such knowledge is needed to                 
              advance techniques of enhancing winter-time orographic                         
              precipitation.  During the Austral winter of 1990, a joint                     
              experiment was held with scientists from Australia and the                     
              University of Nevada with most of the field costs covered by the               
              Australian government.  The research objectives were to measure                
              mesoscale water budgets near mountainous terrain during the                    
              passage of extratropical cyclones and to understand how this                   
              budget is affected by mesoscale cloud structures.                              
                   Under this renewal proposal, the Principal Investigator will              
              continue his analysis of data collected during this experiment.                
              His two research objectives are: to examine supercooled liquid                 
              water and precipitation development within moving mesoscale                    
              precipitation features and stationary orographic clouds                        
              associated with winter storms; and to estimate the precipitation               
              efficiency of mesoscale features and orographic clouds to learn                
              whether they contain excess supercooled liquid water which could               
              be seeded for potential precipitation enhancement.
