Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project plans to study the distributional effects of                      
              distortionary tax policy.  In most analyses of tax reform, the                 
              question of how tax policy affects agents with different                       
              preferences, endowments or investment opportunities is not                     
              addressed.  In the case of dynamic economies, the main reason for              
              this omission is that the task is computationally formidable.                  
              However, preliminary indications show that numerical methods used              
              in fluid dynamics and structural mechanics for solving partial                 
              differential equations may be applicable.  This research                       
              investigates their application to a model with heterogeneous agents            
              and distortionary taxation.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The project requires several planning activities.  The first is to             
              test the methods on cases for which there is a known solution.                 
              Such problems usually involve a distortion-free economy inhabited              
              by identical agents.  The second is to test the methods on models              
              with identical agents and distortionary taxes.  For some models of             
              a distorted economy, there exists a transformation of parameters               
              or variables which makes it resemble a distortion-free economy.                
              For both sets of test cases, alternative numerical methods will be             
              used to validate the results.  Preliminary results show that finite            
              difference techniques perform well and may be sufficiently                     
              efficient for maximum likelihood estimation.  Finally, the                     
              alternative finite-element and variational methods will also be                
              explored.
