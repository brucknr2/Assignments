Abstract    :
                   During the last Pleistocene glacial advance, ice covered                  
              much of the modern day range of the threespine stickleback                     
              (Gasterosteus aculeatus).  As the glaciers began to retreat about              
              14,000 years ago, a diversity of freshwater habitats were created              
              and subsequently colonized by the marine threespine stickleback.               
              Today, the resultant freshwater populations are undergoing rapid               
              evolutionary diversification throughout northwestern North                     
              America, and in some cases speciation has occurred.  This                      
              remarkable, recent radiation holds great promise for providing                 
              information on the patterns and mechanisms of evolutionary                     
              change.  It also provides a model for adaptive radiations that                 
              have new genera and higher taxa.                                               
                   The proposed research will determine, for the first time,                 
              the reproductive behavior patterns exhibited by marine threespine              
              stickleback, and the extent to which they vary among sites.  This              
              is essential for interpreting the patterns of change in the                    
              radiation because the marine form is thought to have given rise                
              to the divergent freshwater forms observed today.  In addition,                
              the diversity of reproductive behavior in twenty or more Alaskan               
              freshwater populations will be documented.  These observations                 
              will not only provide a first approximation of the range of                    
              behavioral diversification among Alaskan freshwater populations,               
              but will enable the investigators to select populations for                    
              future research on the evolution of specific behavioral                        
              phenotypes.
