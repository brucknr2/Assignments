Abstract    :
                   Although data are most often recorded as observations at a                
              single point, on many occasions the data are actually curves, for              
              example a motion or a growth pattern or a development process                  
              occurring over time.  The goal of this research is to develop                  
              statistical procedures which draw inferences from curves or                    
              estimated curves directly.  In particular, this research is                    
              concerned with multivariate methods addressing problems in                     
              principal components analysis, canonical correlation,                          
              discriminant analysis and prediction.
