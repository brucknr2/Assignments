Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are to experimentally examine                   
              the effects of radiative heat transfer on the coagulation                      
              rates of soot particles formed in hydrocarbon flames.  Recent                  
              theoretical studies micrometer sized, carbonaceous soot                        
              particles in high-temperature gases, indicated that particles                  
              cooler than the gas can have diffusion and coagulation rates                   
              one order of magnitude greater than those predicted from                       
              conventional Brownian dynamics.  A net radiative absorption by                 
              the particle, on the other hand, can act to decrease or freeze                 
              the coagulation rate.  In the proposed work, the theoretical                   
              predictions will be directly examined through measurement of                   
              the size, number density, and coagulation rate of soot                         
              particles.  Particle measurements will be performed using non-                 
              intrusive laser light extinction and scattering methods.                       
                                                                                             
              Demonstration of a relationship between radiation and soot                     
              particle dynamics would provide valuable insight into the                      
              factors affecting combustion particulate transport and growth,                 
              and would have important consequences on the scaling of                        
              particle dynamical models from small to large scale                            
              combustion, environments.  In addition, the results will e                     
              used for the development of new methods of particulate control                 
              and removal from combustion exhaust gases.      //
