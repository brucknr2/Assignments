Abstract    :
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                     
              (EPSCoR) in the state of Maine is conducted by the Maine                       
              Science and Technology Commission, with input from the                         
              Research Excellence Partnership.  Maine EPSCoR will enhance                    
              the research competitiveness of over 20 investigators                          
              working in three research clusters:  (1) Marine Molecular                      
              Biology Research Cluster; and (2) Wood Sciences and                            
              Engineering Research Center (3) Global Environmental Change                    
              Center.  Collaborations are proposed among scientists at the                   
              University of Maine; the Mount Desert Island Biological                        
              Laboratory; the State Geological Survey; the Bigelow                           
              Laboratory for Ocean Studies, and the Maine Department of                      
              Marine Resources.  The three research areas, which were                        
              selected on their scientific merits, are of importance to                      
              the State of Maine in terms of research excellence, human                      
              resource development, and opportunities for economic                           
              vitality.  The objectives for the Maine Advanced Development                   
              Program are: (1) to develop and implement a long range plan                    
              for integrating S&E research, education, and development                       
              into the state's economic development strategy; (2) increase                   
              awareness and importance of science and engineering; (3)                       
              build and retain technical expertise; and (4) expand state                     
              support for research.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Over the three-year award period the State of Maine will                       
              contribute over $5 million to ensure the success of the                        
              EPSCoR effort.
