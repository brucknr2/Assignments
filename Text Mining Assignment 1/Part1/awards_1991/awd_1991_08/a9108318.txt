Abstract    :
                 Professor Beauchamp is supported by a grant from the                        
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to investigate the                     
              properties, structures, and reaction dynamics of biomolecules                  
              in the gas phase.  The long term objective is to devise rapid                  
              and reliable methods for amino acid and nucleotide sequence                    
              determinations with subpicomole samples.  Soft ionization                      
              techniques, including laser desorption, fast atom bombardment,                 
              and electrospray ionization will be used to form singly and                    
              multiply charged molecular ions of thermally fragile                           
              biomolecules.  The major technique for characterization is                     
              Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance spectroscopy.

              The determination of the sequence of amino acids in proteins                   
              and of the base pairs in nucleotides requiring only minute                     
              samples will be carried out using techniques which gently                      
              remove electrons from these thermally fragile biomolecules, and                
              then trap, manipulate and detect the ions which have been                      
              formed.
