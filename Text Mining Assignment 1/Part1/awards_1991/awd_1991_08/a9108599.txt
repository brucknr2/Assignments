Abstract    :
              The symposium "Structure, Development and Phylogeny of Cranial                 
              Nerves"  is highly focused on innervation patterns and embryonic               
              origins of the various functional components of the cranial nerves.            
              There is considerable research in this area, and there has not been            
              a major symposium bringing the diversity of findings together.                 
              This will be accomplished by bringing various comparative                      
              vertebrate biologists together to provide a forum for the                      
              presentation of new findings and to be able to compare differences             
              in cranial nerves among the various lineages.  This should lead to             
              a better interpretation of homology.  The results of the symposium             
              will be published and widely distributed---this may be even more               
              important than the discussion at the symposium itself.  The program            
              does include two graduate students and their support is worthwhile.
