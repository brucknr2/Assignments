Abstract    :
                   This proposal seeks to extend ongoing work in reservoirs and              
              small impoundments, pursuing an evaluation of the generality of                
              the trophic cascade hypothesis.  This hypothesis is currently                  
              being tested in north temperate open-water and inshore, benthic                
              communities.  Southeastern reservoirs, the focus of this work,                 
              differ dramatically from northern lakes in that an open-water                  
              omnivore, gizzard shad, occurs in abundance.  Neither controlled               
              by fish predators (owing to impressive fecundity coupled with a                
              narrow window of vulnerability to predators) nor by their                      
              zooplankton prey (following the mid-summer zooplankton crash,                  
              shad switch to detritus and phytoplankton), gizzard shad regulate              
              community composition via "middle-out" processes, rather than                  
              being regulated by top-down or bottom-up forces.  These                        
              investigators have designed a series of experiments across a                   
              range of spatial scales (1 m3 to 100 hectares) to evaluate                     
              whether gizzard shad can control zooplankton populations and                   
              hence recruitment of bluegill (via exploitative competition for                
              zooplankton) and largemouth bass (by reducing their bluegill                   
              prey).  Preliminary evidence gathered during the past 5 years                  
              strongly supports the perspective that gizzard shad may well                   
              drive community composition in Ohio reservoirs, thus serving as a              
              "critical" species that may well operate in a "middle-out"                     
              fashion.  The experimental approach of this study will evaluate                
              the generality of the cascade hypothesis by assessing its                      
              conceptual strength in reservoir food webs comprised of weak                   
              biotic linkages.
