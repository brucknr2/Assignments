Abstract    :
              This research aims to better understand the relationships between the          
              existence of one-way functions and the polynomial isomorphisms of              
              complete sets for complexity classes using the idea of polynomial              
              creativity.  In particular, the goal is to explore a reasonable                
              condition on one-way functions that implies non-isomorphisms.  Early           
              approaches to this problem, under the  assumption that certain strong          
              one-way functions exist, either turn out a trivial proof or require            
              that the definition of one-way functions be dependent on a particular          
              complete set.  The approach in this project uses recent results and            
              methods of polynomial creativity.
