Abstract    :
              This research is on accelerating mixed level simulation using                  
              general purpose parallel processors.  An existing parallel                     
              simulator is being developed to make the code more portable and                
              available for others to use on several parallel machines.  Parallel            
              discrete event simulation is being used.  Topics addressed are:                
              (1) finding techniques for improving the simulation of large fan-              
              out circuit nodes; and (2) developing graph manipulation algorithms            
              to improve partitioning, to improve signal distribution, and to do             
              asynchronous message passing.  Experiments on benchmark designs                
              with the simulator to study the effects of partitioning, component             
              migration, task size, and computational and communication overhead             
              are being conducted.
