Abstract    :
              The major objective of this project is the further development and             
              elaboration of a multisectoral, intertemporal, nonlinear                       
              programming model to analyze the effects on the Indian economy of              
              restrictions on the emission of greenhouse gases.  This project                
              will also advance a secondary objective of constructing prototype              
              models for other developing counties.  This study is motivated by              
              the presumption that the developing countries may become important             
              emitters of greenhouse gases and by the conviction that policy                 
              formation with respect to greenhouse gas emissions requires country            
              level analyses.  Unique features of this model include: the                    
              tracking of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide, the                    
              formulation of the greenhouse gas restrictions in terms of their               
              total radiative forcing effect rather than in terms of current                 
              emissions rates, the identification of emissions that create                   
              ground-level air pollution, and allowance for retrofitting of                  
              capital equipment.  This research is important because it will                 
              provide a much needed framework for being able to begin analyzing              
              the economic and social consequences of greenhouse-gas abatement               
              on an international scale.
