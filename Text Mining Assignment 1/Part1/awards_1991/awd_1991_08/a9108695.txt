Abstract    :
              An experimental study of the effects of alpha radiation on the                 
              fatigue life of several low-activation steels will be supported                
              under an RIA award.  Specifically, the effects of alpha radiation              
              by helium ion implantation on the microstructure of near-surface               
              regions will be studies and correlated with strain localization                
              from cyclic deformation.  The fatigue strain localization will be              
              modeled for various compositions using the interactions of glide               
              dislocations with the radiation-induced defects.
