Abstract    :
                   The Computer Aided Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE)Center For               
              Electronic Packaging is presently an NSF/IUCRC, with an annual                 
              budget of over $900,000.  The activities of the  existing Center               
              will be expanded to conduct research and development of high                   
              volume, highly-reliable and internationally competitive commercial             
              electronic products.  The program will incorporate cost                        
              effectiveness, producibility and supportability as well as high                
              reliability, into a concurrent product development process to                  
              enhance the economic development and competitiveness of the                    
              electronic industry in the United States.  Manufacturability,                  
              product yield, quality, reliability and life cycle costs will be               
              addressed concurrently during the design phase, and there will be              
              rapid transfer of improved methods, technologies and logistics into            
              product development.  To accomplish this, the Center research is               
              organized into four interdisciplinary research thrust areas, each              
              with defined core and non-core activities: (1) design development              
              for product performance; (2) product producibility and                         
              supportability; (3) life cycle modeling and assessment; and (4)                
              experimentation and validation.                                                
                   The results will be transferred directly to the industrial                
              members through developed software, guidelines and standards.  New             
              technologies will be incorporated directly into software through               
              improved algorithms and enhanced databases which will in turn aid              
              industry's capability to achieve designs for improved                          
              producibility, reliability and supportability.  Technology transfer            
              activities include workshops, short courses, training and                      
              consulting sessions at local community colleges and state-sponsored            
              organizations for small-business initiatives, in addition to                   
              current technology transfer activities at the CALCE Center and at              
              member sites.  The State of Maryland, industry and NSF will provide            
              matching funds totalling $750,000 in the first year.
