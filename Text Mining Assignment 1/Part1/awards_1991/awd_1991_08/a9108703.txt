Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The 1991 Southeast Regional Developmental Biology Conference will              
              be held at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on May              
              6-9, 1992. The organizers of the meeting are Dr. Ralph S.                      
              quatrano and Brian K Kay. the conference is composed of five                   
              sessions: 1) Gene Expression in Development; 2) Signal Pathways                
              in Development; 3) Cell Determination and Differentiation; 4)                  
              Transgenic Systems; and 5) Cell-Cell Interactions. In order to                 
              advance the participation of junior members within the region,                 
              the sessions will be composed of 20 minute talks by junior                     
              faculty and 10 minute talks by postdoctoral and graduate                       
              students; to draw the interest of those not giving platform                    
              talks, we have invited three nationally prominent developmental                
              biologists to give keynote addresses. In addition, all                         
              participants will have the opportunity to present posters. This                
              meeting will provide an excellent opportunity for scientists and               
              their students from Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South                  
              Carboline, Georgia, and Florida to meet and exchange ideas and                 
              information on developmental biology. Based on the attendance of               
              recent meetings, 1--125 participants are expected. Partial                     
              support is requested from NSF to help defray room expenses for                 
              graduate students and postdocs attending the Conference, travel                
              expenses of students and keynote lecturers, facility rental and                
              mailing/advertising expenses.
