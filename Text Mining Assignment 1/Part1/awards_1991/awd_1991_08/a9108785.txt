Abstract    :
                   A new symmetrization method for the numerical solution of                 
              partial differential equations on emerging parallel computers                  
              will be studied.  The algorithmic development of the method in                 
              the context of massive parallelization will be emphasized.  The                
              method of symmetrization is attractive for an elliptic partial                 
              differential operator, A=S+BT in that it transforms the problem                
              in A to one in an operator that is self-adjoint and that closely               
              resembles S, the self-adjoint part.  Thus, by invoking symmetry                
              even for nonself-adjoint problems, it allows the use of efficient              
              and robust versions of multilevel and conjugate gradient                       
              algorithms for the solution of the arising linear systems of                   
              equations.                                                                     
                   The use of multilevel and conjugate gradient algorithms in                
              the implementation of the method on a parallel computer will                   
              provide the opportunity to study parallelization in a context                  
              where a multilevel algorithm itself is used as in inner solver                 
              for an algorithm composed of inner and outer iterations.  The                  
              algorithms will be tested in a massively parallel environment                  
              offered by the Connection Machine.
