Abstract    :
              This project is to study the genetic and molecular basis of                    
              regulatory interactions termed cross talk between the phosphate                
              (PHO) regulon and genes in the creABCD, formerly called phoM,                  
              operon and to define the biological role of the creABCD operon in              
              Escherichia coli.  The project focuses entirely on regulatory                  
              interactions involving the creABCD operon.  The PHO regulon encodes            
              genes for the acquisition of environmental phosphorus (P) and is               
              induced when the external (ext) inorganic phosphate (Pi) level is              
              growth limiting. The creABCD operon, whose expression is unaffected            
              by Pi(ext), seems to respond to the level of an internal (int)                 
              organophosphate formed in central metabolism, which may be formed              
              in substrate-level phosphorylation (in glycolysis or the TCA cycle)            
              at a step where Pi(int) is incorporated into organophosphate.                  
              Regulatory interactions are expected between genes in a                        
              metabolic pathway; Pi(ext) to Pi(int) to organophosphate (int) in              
              which Pi(ext) regulates the PHO regulon and organophosphate(int)               
              may regulate both the PHO regulon and the creABCD operon. Such                 
              cross talk may be an example of an underlying control mechanisms               
              essential for general (global) control of cell metabolism and                  
              growth; this is especially apparent in the control of gene                     
              expression in bacteria, but may quite possibly play the same role              
              in eucaryotic cells too.
