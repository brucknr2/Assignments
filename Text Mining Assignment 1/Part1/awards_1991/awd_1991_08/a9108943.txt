Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Information on the early evolution of the higher primates                      
              (anthropoids) is largely known from excavations at the Fayum in                
              Egypt.  Many descriptions of the Fayum fossil primates have been               
              published over the years but there has been little attempt to put              
              them in the context of an ecological setting or their ecological               
              relationships to other extant mammalian species.  This project                 
              will seek to detail the mammalian component of the Fayum                       
              community and any changes in its structure over time.                          
              Identification of species has already been initiated on the Fayum              
              fossils housed at Duke University and will be completed on those               
              in the collection at the Cairo Geological Museum.  Identification              
              will be accomplished through dental analysis.                                  
                                                                                             
              With data on the relative abundance of species, the PIs will be                
              able to investigate changes in the composition over time and                   
              possibly space and thus provide a clearer picture of the origin                
              of the higher primates.
