              This award supports a conference entitled, "The Third                          
              Symposium on Expert Systems Application to Power

              in Tokyo, Japan.  Support from NSF is being sought to                          
              enable the attendance of U.S. investigators at this

              at this conference are authored or co-authored by U.S.                         
              university researchers.  These researchers will be given
