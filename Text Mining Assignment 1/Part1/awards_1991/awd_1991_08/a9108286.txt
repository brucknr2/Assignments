Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics will study the algebraic                  
              structure of string theories and other entities.  String                       
              theories may provide an explanation of all the basic forces of                 
              nature, but they are mathematically subtle and complicated.                    
              Thus, the study of the mathematical structures underlying them                 
              is quite important.
