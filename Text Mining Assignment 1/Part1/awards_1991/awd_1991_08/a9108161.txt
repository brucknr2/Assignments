Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for a planning grant to the School of                    
              Engineering and Computer Science at California State University,               
              Fullerton which could lead to the establishment of an                          
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Systems                    
              Science.  The Center will be devoted to the development of                     
              analytical and computational solutions for complex engineering                 
              systems with direct application in Southern California industry.               
              The Center will initially focus on optimizing of information                   
              processing in the aerospace industry.  The planning grant will be              
              used to generate interest and support for the aerospace companies              
              to develop a suitable research plan which will be the basis for a              
              proposal for the establishment of an I/UCRC on Systems Science at              
              Cal State University.                                                          
                   The Program Director recommends the award of $25,000 to the               
              California State University for a planning grant to study the                  
              feasibility of establishing an I/UCRC for Systems Science.
