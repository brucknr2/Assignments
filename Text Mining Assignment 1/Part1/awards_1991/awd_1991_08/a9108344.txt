Abstract    :
                   Two sets of experiments will be carried out using the Oak                 
              Ridge National Laboratory tandem Van de Graaf accelerator in the               
              low MeV/u range.  In the first, oxygen ion projectiles with                    
              energies between 0.3 and 2 MeV/u will be used to bombard                       
              molecular hydrogen and noble gas targets.  The energy and angular              
              distributions of resulting electrons will be studied.  In the                  
              second set, the formation of doubly-excited states of Ag4+ and                 
              Ag12+ incident on He, H2 and Ar gas targets will be studied.  This             
              study will contribute fundamental information about electron-                  
              electron correlations in such collisions.
