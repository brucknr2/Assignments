Abstract    :
                   An International Conference on Gauge Theories - Past and                  
              Future will be held May 16 - 18, 1991 at the University of                     
              Michigan.  The conference will bring together some of the                      
              leaders in elementary particle physics (in which gauge                         
              theories have played a central role in the past two decades),                  
              as well as younger physicists, and provide a forum for the                     
              discussion of both experimental and theoretical developments                   
              in gauge theories.
