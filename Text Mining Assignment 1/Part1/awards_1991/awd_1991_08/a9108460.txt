Abstract    :
                 This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, to develop a                
              submitochondrial in vitro translation and integration system for               
              mitochondria.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Mitochondrial biogenesis is an important problem in cell biology.              
              Most of the current work in this field focuses on import of nuclear            
              encoded proteins into the mitochondria.  Very few laboratories are             
              investigating the problem from the point of view of the                        
              mitochondrially encoded proteins, because it is a much more                    
              difficult problem to approach.  The development of a totally in                
              vitro submitochondrial system for mitochondrial translation and                
              integration would allow the problem to become much more                        
              approachable.  This is a very difficult and risky endeavor, which,             
              if successful, would have major impact on the field of                         
              mitochondrial biogenesis.
