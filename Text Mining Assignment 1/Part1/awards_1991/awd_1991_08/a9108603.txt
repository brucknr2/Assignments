Abstract    :
                   Dr. William Eschmeyer is the Curator in charge of the fish                
              collection at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.             
              Dr. Eschmeyer has embarked on an ambitious project to prepare and              
              disseminate of two large data resources for the world's fish                   
              species: 1) a computer database of 50,000+ records corresponding               
              to the species of living fish and their 20,000 bibliographic                   
              references, and 2) a published catalog of the species and their                
              original descriptions in the published literature.   These species-            
              level references will extend the results of Dr. Eschmeyer's                    
              recently completed catalog of fish genera.                                     
                   The proposed information resources would be used by the entire            
              spectrum of biologists working with fishes, ranging from                       
              evolutionary systematists to fisheries managers.  The published                
              catalog of species and its corresponding computer database will                
              have wide impact on an array of research disciplines.
