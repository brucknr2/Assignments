Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary purpose of this Dissertation Improvement Award is to               
              investigate the role of developmental principles in the growth of              
              non-human primates.  Generally, it is assumed that growth patterns             
              of animals are responses to the need for functional adaptations.               
              However, it has been know for some time that alterations in the                
              growth of one area of the body can greatly affect the growth and               
              form of structures elsewhere.   Specifically, the body's growth                
              gradients along anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes,                    
              potentially could greatly affect form and function.                            
                                                                                             
              In this research, the PI will apply the concepts of relative growth            
              to data derived from primates.  Skeletal material from related                 
              genera within a subfamilies will be compared for a variety of                  
              length and breadth measures.  In this way the interactions of                  
              growth gradients can be analyzed for their role in producing the               
              final phenotype.
