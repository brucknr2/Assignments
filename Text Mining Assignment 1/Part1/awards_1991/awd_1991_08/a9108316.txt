Abstract    :
              Computer-based monitoring of the workplace is a fairly recent                  
              phenomenon about which little is known.  This study investigates               
              how computer-based monitoring is currently operating and how it                
              affects the work process and the quality of work life for                      
              employees.  The study also focusses on the economic justification              
              for computer-based monitoring.  The research is conducted as a                 
              multi-site case study of four firms in Tucson, Arizona that use                
              computer-based monitoring.  Data is collected through                          
              observation, structured interviews, and questionnaires over the                
              course of one year.
