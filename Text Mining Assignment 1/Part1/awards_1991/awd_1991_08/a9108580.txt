Abstract    :
              There are several excellent model systems for the study and                    
              understanding of basic chronobiological mechanisms.  These include             
              mammals and other vertebrates as well as a number of invertebrates,            
              higher plants and unicellular forms.  There is a growing                       
              recognition that an understanding of temporal aspects of biological            
              organization and regulation is crucial to the resolution of                    
              important questions in biology.  Basic research in these areas will            
              be covered by the conference, bringing together researchers in                 
              fields ranging from the molecular and genetic, physiological and               
              ecological to psychological and medical.  The common thread will be            
              an understanding of the fundamental cellular biochemical nature of             
              the circadian oscillator, its organization and localization in both            
              unicellular and multicellular organisms and the way it regulates               
              the many different functions known to be under circadian control.              
              The open and free exchange of knowledge and ideas that                         
              characterizes these conferences fosters the development of new                 
              concepts and new approaches.     //
