Abstract    :
              The scales of electronic devices                                               
              are approaching the level where                                                
              quantum mechanical effects are                                                 
              becoming important.  From a                                                    
              practical point of view, the                                                   
              reduction of device size has a                                                 
              direct impact on switching speed                                               
              and power consumption.  A general                                              
              numerical procedure will be                                                    
              developed to solve the multi-                                                  
              dimensional time-dependent and -                                               
              independent Schrodinger equation.                                              
              The former is solved using an                                                  
              efficient Alternative Direction                                                
              implicit technique coupled with a                                              
              Fourier transform of the quantum                                               
              mechanical correlation function to                                             
              solve the latter.  The algorithm is                                            
              also readily extended to include                                               
              the presence of an external                                                    
              magnetic field.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The power of the technique will be                                             
              demonstrated by applying it to                                                 
              several problems of relevance.                                                 
              First, the resonant tunneling of                                               
              wavepacket in two-dimensional                                                  
              structures will be investigated to                                             
              assess the dependence of the                                                   
              tunneling time on the angle of                                                 
              incidence, the electron wavenumber,                                            
              and the roughness of the interfaces                                            
              in a typical heterostructure.                                                  
              Second, the propagation of                                                     
              wavepackets through crossed wires                                              
              geometries in the presence of an                                               
              external magnetic field will be                                                
              studied to better understand the                                               
              origin of the quenching of the                                                 
              quantum Hall effect.  Third, the                                               
              propagation of wavepacket in

              interferometers will be studied to                                             
              assess the feasibility of newly                                                
              proposed Quantum Interferometers                                               
              Transistors.  The algorithm will                                               
              also be used to calculate the                                                  
              quantum-confined Stark shifts for                                              
              both electrons and holes and the                                               
              excitonic states in two-dimensional                                            
              quantum-confined structures, and                                               
              important step towards the                                                     
              characterization of the optical                                                
              properties of these structures.                                                
              The proposed algorithm has also                                                
              potential applications in the field                                            
              of optoelectronics.  The developed                                             
              ADI scheme will also be used as an
