Abstract    :
              An interactive computer program, CAMEO, is being developed to                  
              predict the products of organic reactions given the starting                   
              materials and conditions.  The program uses mechanistic                        
              principles and precedent-based rules for broad classes of                      
              reactions to make its predictions.  Consequently, an important                 
              aspect of the project is the search for organizing principles                  
              that govern organic reactivity in addition to the development                  
              of a resource to aid in the analysis and design of synthetic                   
              pathways.  The program's current capabilities are significant                  
              with sophisticated treatment of several important classes of                   
              reactions including base catalyzed and nucleophilic processes,                 
              thermal pericyclic chemistry, acid catalyzed and electrophilic                 
              reactions, free radical chain reactions, and functional group                  
              oxidations.  The intentions are to expand and refine the                       
              program in many ways.  The most important additions will be for                
              transition metal organometallic chemistry, photochemistry,                     
              catalytic hydrogenations, dissolving metal reductions, and                     
              three-dimensional structure generation and utilization.                        
              Broader distribution of the program is also planned through a                  
              version for the Apple Macintosh II computer.                                   
                                                                                             
              The Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program is supporting the                      
              continuation of the development of this computer based program                 
              CAMEO to predict reactivities of synthetic reagents and their                  
              reaction products.  This has the potential to greatly improve                  
              the efficiency of the synthetic procedures used to meet the                    
              increasingly complex requirements of our economy.
