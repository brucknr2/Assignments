Abstract    :
              This is a travel grant for a USA-China-Japan                                   
              Symposium/Workshop on Advanced Adsorption/Separation Science                   
              and Technology.  This workshop takes place in May 13-15, 1991,                 
              in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China (People's Republic) and is                        
              organized by Profs. Ma (U.S.), Wu (China), and Suzuki (Japan).                 
              The workshop follows the first one, held in Sept. 1988 in the                  
              same place.  The goal is to stimulate research, research                       
              interaction, and information exchange among scientists and                     
              engineers of the three nations.  Adsorption/separation                         
              technology is very important in gas separation (air, water,                    
              pollutants, etc.) heavy metals, liquid pollutants, and                         
              biochemical (proteins, aminoaicds, etc.)  The grant covers                     
              partial travel support for U.S. academic participants U.S.                     
              industrial researchers also participate and benefit from this                  
              workshop.
