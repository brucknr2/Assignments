Abstract    :
                   The Mauna Loa Observatory Photochemistry Experiment-II                    
              (MLOPEX-II), is an experimental program to study the chemical                  
              processing of nitrogenous, sulfurous, and carbonaceous compounds               
              in the remote troposphere through a detailed examination of the                
              chemistry of ozone and other oxidizing species.  Two basic                     
              MLOPEX-II objectives have been formulated and are: to evaluate                 
              the concentration and variability of short-lived trace species on              
              diurnal, synoptic and seasonal time scales and to assess                       
              photochemical models of the remote troposphere over an annual                  
              cycle.  MLOPEX-II is a coordinated multi-institutional experiment              
              involving universities, NCAR, and NOAA.  The field portion of the              
              experiment will be conducted through four six-week intensive                   
              measurement periods, one in each season, and will be located at                
              the Mauna Loa Observatory, HI.  The P.I. plans to make the                     
              following gas phase measurements as part of the MLOPEX-II                      
              program, batch measurements of hydrogen peroxide and specific                  
              organic hydroperoxides and formaldehyde.  The first year will be               
              spent making measurements, performing data reduction, and                      
              analyzing collected data.  The second year will focus upon data                
              analysis and interpretation.
