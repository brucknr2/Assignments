Abstract    :
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                     
              (EPSCoR) in the state of Louisiana will enhance the research                   
              competitiveness of approximately 54 scientists working in 5                    
              research clusters at four institutions (University of                          
              Southwestern Louisiana, Tulane University, Louisiana State                     
              University, and Tulane University Medical Center).  The                        
              research areas to be studied are:  (1) Development of a                        
              Interdisciplinary Center in Molecular Evolution; (2)                           
              Mechanism of Action of Lytic Peptides; (3) Synthesis of                        
              Properties of Enzymes and Other Biopolymers; (4) Fault                         
              Tolerant Neural Networks: Design Theories and Applications;                    
              and (5) Transport Processes Through Interfaces, Membranes,                     
              and Porous Media.  NSF funding through the state's EPSCoR                      
              Committee ("LaSER") has provided a catalyst to structure and                   
              target the earnings from the Louisiana Educational Quality                     
              Fund (LEQSF), a $550 million trust fund dedicated to                           
              enhancing education.  Since 1987, $56 million has been                         
              expended from LEQSF in carefully targeted science and                          
              engineering (S&E) fields to increase research                                  
              competitiveness, enhance departments, endow chairs, and                        
              provide graduate traineeships.  EPSCoR activities are                          
              designed to increase the average federal expenditure level                     
              per S&E in five priority fields by 30 to 45 percentage                         
              points against the national average, and to increase the                       
              number of S&E bachelors and doctoral degrees awarded,                          
              particularly among minorities, to approximately 90 percent                     
              of the national per capita average.  These objectives will                     
              be achieved by continuing successful LEQSF/LaSER programs                      
              and building on the strengths developed in, or emerging                        
              from, the projects being supported through stimulation the                     
              formation of strong focused research groups and using such                     
              "clusters" to promote S&E human resource development.  The                     
              State and institutions will contribute over $12 million over                   
              3 years.
