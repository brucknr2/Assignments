Abstract    :
                   The widespread use of composites in the durable goods sector              
              of the civilian economy has been limited due to high material and              
              manufacturing costs.  The principle research objective of the State            
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Low-Cost, High-            
              Speed, Polymer-Matrix Composites Processing Center at the Michigan             
              State University is to advance the research and technology transfer            
              activities and to enhance the competitiveness of the producer and              
              user industries in the State and surrounding areas.  There are                 
              42,000 plastics related jobs in the State of Michigan and this                 
              total is expected to rise to 52,000 by 1995.  The State has                    
              targeted composites and plastics as a "key" growth area.                       
                   The "core" research program will include the following                    
              technical thrust areas:  Advanced Prepregging, Thermal Management              
              and Novel Processing, Resin Transfer Molding, Reactive Processing              
              of Natural and/or Recycled Constituents, and Artificial                        
              Intelligence Techniques for Composites Design and Processing.  The             
              strong presence of the automotive industry along with its large,               
              medium, and small suppliers will provide a focus and realistic                 
              guidance to the research strategy.  The development of knowledge-              
              based processing systems in the form of computer software will play            
              an important role in technology transfer.  The participation of the            
              University of Michigan, Wayne State University, Michigan                       
              Technological University, and the Michigan Molecular Institute in              
              the "core" research program is a special feature of the center.                
              Each participating company (28) in the center is providing one                 
              member to the Industrial Advisory Board.  The Michigan Materials               
              and Polymer Institute (MMPI), a private, not-for-profit industrial             
              funding consortium will channel its industrial contributions and               
              responsibility for this area to the center.  The State of Michigan,            
              industry and NSF will provide matching funds totalling $750,000 in             
              the first year.  An additional $184,000 will be provided by                    
              industry.
