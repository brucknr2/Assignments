Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support for the Connecticut               
              Logic Seminar in order to assure at least one outside speaker per              
              month.                                                                         
                   The Connecticut Logic Seminar has met weekly since 1974.                  
              Its participants now include the logicians from the University of              
              Connecticut, Wesleyan, Vassar, Southeastern Massachusetts                      
              University, and Yale, as well as other faculty from regional                   
              schools.  Weekly meetings are held on a rotating basis at                      
              Connecticut, Wesleyan, Vassar and Yale.  The seminar typically                 
              ranges over most of current interest in logic, and reflects the                
              interests of the participants and invited speakers.  From time to              
              time, an extended period is spent investigating as topic in                    
              depth, as was done most recently with Hrushovski's examples of                 
              new strongly  minimal sets.  The seminar is of great value not                 
              only to the participating faculty, but to their graduate                       
              students.
