Abstract    :
              This project will contribute to the application of logic to computer           
              science, specifically complexity theory, database theory, and                  
              asymptotic combinatorics.  The project has three parts.  The first             
              part is a systematic investigation of algorithmic problems about paths         
              in graphs from the viewpoint of logical expressibility.  Important             
              path problems will be classified according to their expressibility in          
              the DATALOG query language or in extensions of DATALOG with negation.          
              The second part is an exploration of connections between fixpoint              
              logic and computational complexity.  In addition, a structural theory          
              of optimization will be developed according to the logical                     
              definability of optimization problems.  The third part is a study of           
              asymptotic probabilities on finite structures, such as zero-one laws           
              and associated decision problems for extensions of first-order logic           
              under variable probability measures.
