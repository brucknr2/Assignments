Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Menger will                
              utilize both experimental and theoretical approaches to                        
              identify the origins of intramolecular and enzymatic                           
              reactivity.  The systems chosen for study are constructed so                   
              that two functional groups are held by a rigid molecular                       
              scaffold in a manner such that their mutual geometric                          
              relationship is well defined.  Three additional projects will                  
              be undertaken: (i) the chemistry of "clumps", an evolutionary                  
              approach to catalysis, (ii) construction of a                                  
              cyclodextrin-based system that contains three catalytic                        
              entities, and (iii) an attempt to explain why general base                     
              catalyses in organic models, but not in enzymes, display such                  
              small effective molarities (EMs).

              The long-term goal of Dr. Menger's research program is to                      
              identify the various structural and configurational factors                    
              that determine reactivity in intramolecular and enzymatic                      
              reactions.  Dr. Menger has designed several systems that                       
              utilize "enforced proximity" in an effort to learn how two or                  
              more functional groups behave when covalent and noncovalent                    
              bonding force them to reside in close mutual proximity.  The                   
              results obtained from such studies are expected to be germane                  
              not only to chemical dynamics in solution but also to enzymatic                
              systems, where the binding to the enzyme forces substrate                      
              molecules into close contact with catalytic groups.
