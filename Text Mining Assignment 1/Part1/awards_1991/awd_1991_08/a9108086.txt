Abstract    :
              Digital signal processing (DSP) structures introduce arithmetic                
              error due to finite wordlength effects.  Different number                      
              representations and arithmetic methods have their associated                   
              precision.  This research provides a unifying framework within                 
              which many different design alternatives can be compared.  It                  
              studies various VLSI architectures which satisfy constraints on                
              arithmetic precision while maximizing performance and minimizing               
              VLSI system cost.  It uses a statistical state-space model to                  
              evaluate the precision of fixed-point, floating -point, signed-                
              digital, residue, logarithmic and rational number systems and                  
              distributed and CORDIC arithmetics.  Unlike conventional                       
              microprocessors, dedicated systems can have a multitude of distinct            
              internal wordlengths.  The choice of an adequate wordlength can be             
              defined as an integer optimization problem in which arithmetic                 
              precision is a constraint and some measures of system cost such as             
              VLSI area (A), latency (L), or period (P), as the objective                    
              function.  CAD tool will be built to explore the large design space            
              of alternate arithmetic, architectures and wordlengths.
