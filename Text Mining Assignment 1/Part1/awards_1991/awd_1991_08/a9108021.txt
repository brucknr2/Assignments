Abstract    :
                   The purpose is this project is to study the existence and                 
              nonexistence of positive solutions to superlinear elliptic                     
              boundary value problems; the typical case is where the                         
              nonlinearity is of polynomial type.  Particular emphasis will be               
              placed on domains such as balls, annuli, punctured balls, and                  
              exterior domains.  Existence of positive solutions will be mainly              
              addressed though fixed point theorems and degree theory.                       
              Nonexistence problems will be mainly studied through oscillation               
              theory and Pohozaev identities.                                                
                   The proposed problems are motivated by a variety of                       
              situations arising in gas dynamics, nonlinear heat generation,                 
              quantum field theory, and Riemannian geometry among others.                    
              An integral part of this project will be a number of courses and               
              seminars leading to familiarizing undergraduate and masters                    
              degree students with current mathematical research.
