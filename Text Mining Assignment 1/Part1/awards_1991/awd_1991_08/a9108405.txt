Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Lyle Konigsberg                  
              will conduct a conservation assessment on a large collection of                
              prehistoric skeletons (over 3,600 individuals) which are                       
              maintained in the Department of Anthropology at the University of              
              Tennessee.  These materials are derived primarily from                         
              prehistoric archaeological sites in the Great Plains and the                   
              state of Tennessee and have been accumulated over a number of                  
              years.  Unfortunately, they are not properly housed and curated.               
              The skeletal remains themselves need to be treated to prevent                  
              deterioration and should be repacked.  Ms Shelley Reisman Paine,               
              a conservation consultant will examine the collection, produce an              
              assessment report and recommend a plan of action.  On this basis,              
              remedial work can be carried out.                                              
                                                                                             
              Such skeletal collections constitute an important scientific                   
              resource which allow one to address a number of questions which                
              range from historical origins to human adaptation.  These                      
              materials form the basis for much biological anthropology                      
              research and thus should be conserved and made available for                   
              study.  This grant will assist in these goals.
