Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will study                     
              quasisymmetric embeddings and related classes of mappings.  In                 
              particular, she will look at mappings of p-dimensional euclidean               
              space into n-dimensional space, where p is between 1 and n-1.  A               
              major objective of the research is to classify all such                        
              embeddings that have a quasisymmetry constant equal to one.                    
              Currently results in this direction are known for the cases p=n                
              and p=1, n=2.  It is expected that for the case p=n-1 the only                 
              such embeddings are affine (linear + constant) embeddings.                     
                   Much of the subject of complex variables is concerned with                
              what is called "geometric function theory", the subarea in which               
              one studies the properties of functions or mappings in terms of                
              the geometry of the domain of the function (the set of points on               
              which the function is defined) and the range of the function (the              
              set of values of the function).  In this project the principal                 
              investigator will study certain types of mappings between                      
              euclidean spaces of different dimensions that distort the spaces               
              in a prescribed way.  The goal of the research is to classify all              
              types of functions that have a given distortion.
