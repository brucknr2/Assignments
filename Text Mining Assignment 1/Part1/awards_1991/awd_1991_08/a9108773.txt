Abstract    :
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                     
              (EPSCoR) in the state of South Dakota EPSCoR consists of an                    
              infrastructure improvement plan and two research clusters.                     
              Infrastructure improvements will take place within the                         
              context of cluster projects which are interdisciplinary in                     
              scope and inter-institutional in involvement.  EPSCoR                          
              improvements will enhance the research competitiveness of                      
              over 30 faculty at three institutions (the University of                       
              South Dakota, South Dakota State University, and the South                     
              Dakota School of Mines and Technology).  The research                          
              cluster areas are:  (1) Surface and Interfacial Chemistry                      
              and (2) Regulation of Biological Processes:  The Role of                       
              Membranes.  The state's infrastructure improvement plan                        
              focuses on the development of human resources, on providing                    
              an environment that is conducive to competitive research,                      
              and on building the visibility of scientific research in                       
              South Dakota.  Specific objectives are: to develop science                     
              faculty in both numbers and competitiveness, to strengthen                     
              graduate  programs through competitive recruiting efforts,                     
              to add research equipment and support personnel, and to                        
              establish an effective system for communication between                        
              scientists, between scientists and policy makers, and                          
              between scientists and the South Dakota citizenry.  A                          
              Coordinator for Human Resources Development will oversee                       
              activities aimed at students and teachers in elementary,                       
              middle and high schools.  Non-federal state and                                
              institutional resources of over $6 million will be                             
              contributed to ensure the success of the state's EPSCoR                        
              effort over the three year award period.
