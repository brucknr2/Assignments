Abstract    :
              Exploration of the Far-infrared (FIR) spectral                                 
              region between 40 GHz and 3 THz would                                          
              benefit from the development of fast, sensitive                                
              detectors.  Pyroelectric detectors have been used                              
              successfully in the infrared (IR) spectral region,                             
              and their use can be extended to the FIR by                                    
              integrating them with planar antennas.  An                                     
              antenna-coupled pyroelectric detector (ACPD)                                   
              which will consist of a planar antenna, a                                      
              resistive load element, and a thermally sensitive                              
              pyroelectric will be will be investigated under                                
              this Research Initiation Award.
