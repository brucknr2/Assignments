Abstract    :
                   The general problem of nonparametric function fitting is how              
              best to determine a smooth function which represents "noisy" data              
              without making strong assumptions about the nature of the function             
              beforehand.  When a function of several variables is sought, both              
              conceptual and computational problems increase in complexity; and              
              extensions of one-dimensional techniques may or may not work, for              
              example in applying standard estimation techniques over irregularly            
              shaped regions or subspaces.  This proposal addresses the                      
              construction and evaluation of an efficient class of estimators of             
              characteristics of the unknown function and particularly of its                
              integral.
