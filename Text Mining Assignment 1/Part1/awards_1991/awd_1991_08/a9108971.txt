Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research program is a comprehensive experimental                  
              investigation of the dynamics of ultraviolet excimer laser ablation            
              of materials in plasma versus gas environments.  These will be the             
              first experiments to investigate laser ablation in pre-ionized                 
              plasma backgrounds over a wide range of fill gas pressure, from                
              atmospheric to 1 mTorr.  The objective of this research is to                  
              develop a knowledge base on laser ablation processing in plasmas               
              versus gases which can be usef for engineering applications, such              
              as ablative etching of microelectronics, micromachining, ablative              
              material synthesis, and combustion.  Research will be performed on             
              two important cases concerning interaction of laser-ablated matter             
              (plasma, neutral atoms, and particulates) with 1) background                   
              plasmas versus gases which are nonreacting, and 2) plasmas versus              
              gases which can support oxidation, nitriding, or combustion.                   
              Species-resolved laser probing diagnostic measurements will be                 
              performed to characterize excimer laser ablation plume species                 
              dynamics.  Laser-ablation-assisted-discharge experiments will be               
              performed with applicability to rapid-heating, ablation and                    
              ionization of materials.  Complete experimental facilities exist               
              for this research, including:  excimer lasers (KrF and XeCl), dye              
              laser, CO2 laser, ruby lasers, and copper vapor laser, as well as              
              extensive spectroscopic facilities.                                            
                                                                                             
              The knowledge obtained in this research could lead to breakthroughs            
              in materials processing and synthesis techniques.  Any discoveries             
              will expand the technology base for fabrication in the micro-                  
              electronics, opto-electronics, manufacturing, and machine tool                 
              industries.
