Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the concept of program checking, which           
              is a technique for gaining confidence in the output of a program.  The         
              traditional alternatives to program checking are program verification,         
              which is hard to do, and program testing, which does not provide               
              mathematical guarantees.  Program checking strikes a healthy                   
              compromise--designing a checker for a problem is only as difficult as          
              designing an algorithm for it, but checking provides precise                   
              guarantees about output correctness.                                           
              One of the major goals will be to design checkers for problems which           
              are currently solved by unproven heuristics.  Also, efficient and              
              practical checkers will be implemented for problems in scientific              
              computing, with special emphasis on checking software packages for             
              linear programming, problems in linear algebra, and ordinary and               
              partial differential equations.                                                
              The other major thrust of this research will be to explore the                 
              implications to program checking of new results on the related                 
              concepts of interactive proofs and random self reducibility.  Among            
              the questions considered here will be whether the satisfiability               
              problem is checkable.                                                          
              Writing a checker as part of designing software may become standard            
              practice in the near future, and this research aims to understand the          
              foundations of program checking.//
