Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for the purchase of a Fourier Transform Infrared                 
              Spectrometer, to carry out materials research in quantitative                  
              surface depth profiling of polymers, reflectance spectroscopy of               
              monolayers, physical properties and structure of polyamides and                
              fabrication of integrated circuits.  The unusually high sensitivity            
              of infrared spectroscopy to molecular structure and environment as             
              expressed through peak frequency, area, intensity and half-width               
              establishes the technique as essential for new insight in these                
              materials research areas.  The chemical and physical information               
              available from vibrational spectroscopy is vital to an increased               
              understanding of materials.  The proposed instrument will provide              
              a high degree of flexibility in terms of data acquisition, software            
              modification and hardware control imperative to the design and                 
              execution of state-of-the-art materials science research.
