Abstract    :
              Three aspects of the reaction of oxygen with microporous                       
              carbons are investigated in this study:  the kinetics of the                   
              formation of the surface complex; the role of hydrogen in the                  
              solid; and the influence of structural characteristics on the                  
              kinetics.                                                                      
              Steady-state and transient kinetic data are obtained using                     
              thermograivmetric techniques and gas analysis.  Chars are                      
              characterized by surface area, micropore volume, and micropore                 
              size analysis from physisorption data.  Interpretation of the                  
              data requires a site-distribution model; therefore  the study                  
              includes a critical analysis of such models.                                   
                                                                                             
              Although gas-solid reactions are central to many chemical and                  
              energy prosesses, they are poorly understood.  This project                    
              addresses the issue systematically.  The particular system                     
              chosen for study is of vital interest in combustion science.                   
              Improved efficiency and control are possible spinoffs from                     
              this work.
