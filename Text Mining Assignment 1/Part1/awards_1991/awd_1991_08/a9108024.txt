Abstract    :
              With the exception of psychology and the health sciences, women                
              continue to represent only marginal participants in the continuing             
              flow of new doctorates into the U.S. science and engineering talent            
              pool.  The output of graduate training directly affects the pools              
              of talent available to research organizations; colleges and                    
              universities; civic, governmental, and religious entities;                     
              businesses; and elementary and secondary education.  As William                
              Bowen said,                                                                    
                                                                                             
                   At their best, those who earn graduate degrees in the arts and            
                   sciences contribute not only their own ideas to society, but              
                   also a capacity to educate and prepare those who will exercise            
                   leadership on a broad scale.                                              
                                                                                             
              Clearly, the extent to which women can be players in this labor                
              market rests on their number emerging each year from graduate                  
              training.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The factors that affect the level of participation of women in                 
              graduate training and in the labor force are well known and include            
              the availability of adequate financial support, interactions with              
              role models and mentors who can provide guidance in potential                  
              career choices, support of family members and peers, opportunities             
              to interact with women scientists and engineers in similar academic            
              programs or employment, and even women's own confidence in their               
              ability to "do" math and science.  The role of a continuing                    
              committee would be to identify the factors that can be influenced              
              rapidly and efficiently and to generate an action plan to do so.               
              The action plan to be developed by the Committee on Women in                   
              Science and Engineering of the National Research Council (NRC) will            
              respond both to needs identified by Federal and private sponsors               
              as well as by the expert opinions of the committee of leaders in               
              this area.
