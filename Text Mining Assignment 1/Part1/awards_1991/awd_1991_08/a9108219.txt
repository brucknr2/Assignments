Abstract    :
                   The investigator studies various models of phase transitions              
              in either a pure substance or a binary alloy.  The fundamental                 
              models are singularly perturbed partial differential equations                 
              whose solutions are evolving continuous fields that represent                  
              either an order parameter, measuring degree of solidification, or              
              local concentration of one of the species in a binary alloy.  The              
              three basic models are known as the Cahn-Allen, the                            
              Cahn-Hilliard, and the Phase Field equations.  Taking certain                  
              distinguished limits as the singular parameter approaches zero                 
              leads to equations for the motion of sharp interfaces, which are               
              also studied.                                                                  
                   Materials science has grown more mathematical even as it                  
              has become a more critical technology.  This work can contribute               
              to a better understanding of behavior of materials and the                     
              development of new materials.  Similar mathematical problems                   
              involving phase transitions arise in other areas of physics and                
              engineering also.
