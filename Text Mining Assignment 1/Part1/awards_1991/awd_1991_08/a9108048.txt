Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Investigating the properties of superfluid (sf) 3He in confined                
              geometries, we propose to continue studies of our recently                     
              discovered phase transition in thin films.  Additional work on sf              
              3He films thinner than 200 over a monolayer of 4He will probe the             
              two-dimensional regime.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This research is designed to enhance our understanding of quantum              
              fluids, testing existing theories and providing data that will lead            
              to further improvements therein.
