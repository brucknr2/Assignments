Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The main goal of the proposed research is to perform                      
              numerical simulations in the field of high Tc superconductivity                
              on the massively parallel Connection Machine, CM-2.  The                       
              dynamical properties of the strongly correlated electronic 2D                  
              Hubbard model will be investigated, focussing on the two central               
              issues of high Tc theory, does the ground state have long range                
              superconducting order?, and what is the nature of the normal                   
              state?  The simulations will be carried out with codes using                   
              both exact and stochastic techniques.  The study of the                        
              performance of the different codes using this machine                          
              architecture, should yield a substantial improvement in our                    
              understanding, not only of the physical problem, but also of                   
              data-parallel programming.
