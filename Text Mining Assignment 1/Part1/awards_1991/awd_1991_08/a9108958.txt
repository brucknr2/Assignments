Abstract    :
                   Linear and nonlinear regression models are used for                       
              statistical analysis of data from physical, social, and                        
              biological sciences as well as engineering and economics.  One of              
              the omissions made by the analysts is the question of stability                
              of the regression parameters.  For time-ordered data, however,                 
              this is a major question.The proposal will develop effective                   
              methods to determine the points at which these changes might have              
              occurred.                                                                      
                   Polynomial,harmonic and,generalized linear and nonlinear                  
              models are considered.  Bayes estimators for these situations                  
              will be developed.
