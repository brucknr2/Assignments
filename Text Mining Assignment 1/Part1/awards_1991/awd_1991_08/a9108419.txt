Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A systematic study of the electronic structure and reactivity of a             
              new class of molecular carbon clusters (fullerenes) is proposed.               
              The program is aimed at the following issues:  investigating the               
              electronic energy level distributions for isolated and derivatized             
              fullerene molecules, studying the changes in occupied and empty                
              electronic states due to solid-state formation, with an emphasis on            
              energy band formation, surface and interfacial studies of bond                 
              formation and stability of Fullerenes with metal and semiconductor             
              adatoms and overlayers; catalysis, and photon- and electron-                   
              enhanced oxidation.
