Abstract    :
              Incorporating High Tc                                                          
              Superconducting (HTS) materials in                                             
              planar transmission lines is very                                              
              promising for high speed digital,                                              
              and high frequency analog                                                      
              applications.  Before full                                                     
              exploitation of the HTS's, their

              capacities need to be assessed.                                                
              Knowing the material critical

              lead to the maximum current that can                                           
              be carried by the transmission line.                                           
              In this Research Initiation Award,                                             
              London's equations and the two-fluid                                           
              model will be used to investigate                                              
              the current distributions on HTS                                               
              transmission lines.  They will be                                              
              coupled with one of two                                                        
              electromagnetic models.  The first                                             
              on is a full-wave analysis.  The                                               
              developed equations are discretized                                            
              over the structure cross-section in

              line without exceeding the critical                                            
              current density of the material as                                             
              well as the total power can be                                                 
              calculated.  The losses due to                                                 
              normal electrons and the Q-factor                                              
              are directly obtained.  We have                                                
              already performed initial                                                      
              calculations, and the preliminary                                              
              results are very encouraging.  We                                              
              here propose to fully develop the                                              
              model by incorporating substrate                                               
              losses and non-linear conductivity.                                            
              Then, the fully developed models                                               
              will be used for comprehensive
