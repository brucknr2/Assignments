Abstract    :
              This grant addresses various issues related to non-                            
              linear charge transport in one dimensional artificial                          
              structures in a temperature range from liquid                                  
              helium to higher temperature.  We will focus on                                
              basic and high field transport properties in highly                            
              quantized systems with special emphasis on                                     
              electron-phonon interaction, intersubband and real                             
              space transfer effects.  The research employs an                               
              integrated theoretical and experimental approach                               
              which involves tools and technologies developed by                             
              our group at the University of Illinois.
