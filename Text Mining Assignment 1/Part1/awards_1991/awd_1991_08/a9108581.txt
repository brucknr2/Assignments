Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor Wolfgang                    
              Schmidt to work on diophantine problems.  He will work on                      
              polynomial-exponential equations, linear recurrences, and the                  
              number of integer solutions of Siegel's theorem on curves.  He                 
              also wishes to work on extending Vojta's refinement of the                     
              subspace theorem to a wider framework.                                         
                   This is research in the field of number theory.  Number                   
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
