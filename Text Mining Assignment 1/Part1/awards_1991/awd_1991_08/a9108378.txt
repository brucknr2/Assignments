Abstract    :
              The program continues a successful existing program into the                   
              study of organized, multimolecular assemblies of surfactant                    
              molecules.  Chemical composition, physical structure and the                   
              extent of organization of these assemblies will be                             
              investigated.  The project aims to measure the fluidity of                     
              synthetic phospholipid bilayers as a function of phospholipid                  
              structure and surface concentration; to characterize the effect                
              of cholesterol on the membrane fluidity and studies that may                   
              lead to a cholesterol sensor; to investigate the electron                      
              hopping and proton diffusion in these assemblies; and to                       
              develop chiral selectivity and gating properties at electrode                  
              surfaces using monolayer films.                                                
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on studies of the dynamics of lateral                       
              processes in monolayers and bilayers at interfaces.   The                      
              research is intended to mimic the structures and functions of                  
              biological membrane systems.   The project continues an                        
              important program aimed at developing new methods for the study                
              of model membrane systems at solid-solution and air-water                      
              interfaces.  The outcome of the research will be important not                 
              only in our understanding of electrochemistry and thin films,                  
              but will also have considerable importance in the understanding                
              of membrane action in biological systems.
