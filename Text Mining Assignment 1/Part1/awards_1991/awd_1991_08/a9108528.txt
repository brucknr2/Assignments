Abstract    :
              Lo         The problem of mapping parallel algorithms to parallel  architectures
              involves the assignment of tasks in the parallel  computation to processors and
              the routing of messages through the  interconnection network.  This research
              utilizes information  about the regularity present in both the computation and
              the  interconnection network for efficient mapping.  It focuses on the  design,
              implementation, and testing of mapping algorithms for  three target
              architectures: the mesh, hypercube, and deBruijn  network.  In addition, it
              develops a graph description language  and an underlying graph theoretic model
              to support mapping.  The  model captures information about the static and
              temporal  structure of the computation, while the language enables the user  to
              express this information in a natural and compact notation.   This research
              represents a step in the evolution toward automatic  mapping.  It paves the way
              for the compiler to play an increasing  important role as a source of
              information for the mapper.
