Abstract    :
                   A major obstacle in design research is a representation and               
              language to describe a design problem, interpret the design, and               
              recognize modifications to the design to support design innovation.            
              As a significant step toward solving this problem, a graph-based               
              representation will be developed which abstracts essential                     
              geometric descriptions of a body to a level where modification and             
              interpretation of the body becomes computationally feasible.  The              
              anticipated graph not only represents an abstract model of the                 
              geometry of the body, but also models physical constitutive                    
              relations and behavioral design constraints.                                   
                   The graph can be expanded based on optimization information,              
              modeling the process of design innovation.  A language of features             
              is then defined on the graph representation to describe and                    
              interpret the design computationally; the language will be built               
              on top of the graph to recognize features modeled in the geometric             
              representation and adjust design constraints accordingly.  This                
              research is part of a long-term goal to create a design environment            
              which can reason about a design problem at various levels of                   
              abstraction to support the rapid generation of solution concepts.
