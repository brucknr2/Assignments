Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor D. Kleitman to              
              work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate various problems             
              in enumeration, geometric combinatorics graph theory and extremal              
              set theory.                                                                    
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
