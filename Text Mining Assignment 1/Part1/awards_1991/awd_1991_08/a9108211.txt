Abstract    :
                   In many practical situations, data are censored, that is the              
              observations are only known to exceed particular values.  This                 
              research explores some basic concepts in decision theory as                    
              applied to censored observations.  In particular, product-limit                
              estimators are commonly used in the estimation of survival                     
              functions; the admissibility and minimaxity of these estimators                
              and variants will be investigated.  Undergraduate students will                
              assist with computational aspects, particularly generation of                  
              empirical distributions for small samples.
