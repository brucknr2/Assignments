Abstract    :
                   Mapping class groups and moduli spaces can be approached from             
              several very different directions:  through geometric geometry, 3-             
              dimensional topology and hyperbolic geometry; through algebraic                
              geometry (specifically the theory of algebraic curves); and through            
              mathematical physics via conformal field theory.  There are also               
              interesting connections with arithmetic groups and representation              
              theory.  There is often little communication between the various               
              groups working in this area, and the techniques and proofs of one              
              group are often not well understood by those in another.                       
                   This grant will partially support a conference whose aim is to            
              assemble experts in these fields, together with graduate students              
              and young mathematicians from the various fields, so that the                  
              participants can deepen their understanding of this area.  This                
              should result in a good deal of cross-fertilization and progress in            
              algebraic geometry.  The conference will be held in August, 1991,              
              at the University of Washington.
