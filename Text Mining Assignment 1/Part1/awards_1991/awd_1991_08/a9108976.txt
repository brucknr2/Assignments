Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to analyze the productivity within              
              manufacturing industries using the longitudinal research data                  
              base at the Bureau of the Census.  The goal of this research is                
              to determine why some industrial plants are more productive than               
              others and, to ask whether there is any systematic relation                    
              between trends in the productivity growth of an industry and                   
              changes in the distribution of productivity of the plants within               
              that industry.  This project is important because it will help us              
              better understand the factors governing productivity at the                    
              plant and industry level.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The first part of the analysis will use the rankings of                        
              productivity of plant and nonparametric tests to determine                     
              whether, when productivity growth slowed, was the slowdown                     
              uniform across plants or did some plants slow more or less than                
              others?  Did the plants that were on the productivity frontier                 
              slow more or less?  Similar questions can be asked for the                     
              period of the rebound in productivity.  The second part of the                 
              analysis will follow the productivity of plants over time in                   
              order to assess alternative models of the productivity                         
              distribution.
