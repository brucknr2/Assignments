Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Certain genes are activated to express proteins when cells are                 
              stimulated in particular ways.  Within the nervous system, one                 
              gene of current interest is known as "c-fos" and there are two                 
              possible mechanisms that may activate its expression.  In some                 
              studies, high levels of activity in nerve cells apparently turn                
              on c-fos expression.  There are some other studies that indicate               
              c-fos may be turned on instead by a change in normal levels of                 
              activity, suggesting a role for this gene in the phenomenon of                 
              neural plasticity.  Such plasticity is the property that allows a              
              nerve cell to change its output signal in relation to a given                  
              input, and is important in understanding properties of                         
              development and circuits underlying learning.  This exploratory                
              (SGER) work will utilize the known directional sensitivity of                  
              cells in the visual system, in the retina of the eye and in the                
              brain, to see what role c-fos expression plays during specific                 
              directional responsiveness.  Beyond its importance for visual                  
              neuroscience, a high impact on neuroscience in general is likely               
              if this work develops a way of specifically staining an entire                 
              physiological class of individual nerve cells, since such direct               
              demonstrations of structure and function are usually done one                  
              cell at a time.  There is a further great potential impact on                  
              neuroscience, particularly sensory and developmental                           
              neuroscience, by clarifying how genetic expression is related to               
              neuronal activity and plasticity.
