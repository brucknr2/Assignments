Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds for the acquisition of a microscope,              
              image analysis system, and computer which will be used by eight                
              scientists working independently or collaboratively on five                    
              different projects to expand and technically enhance ongoing                   
              basic research in plant molecular, cellular, and developmental                 
              biology.  This research is experimental in approach and focused                
              on cellular and molecular biological interests, such as,                       
              chloroplast dna molecules, ultrastructural responses to heat                   
              shock mechanisms controlling abscission, bacterial gene                        
              expression, and the formation of pit membranes in woody dicots.                
              An image analysis system capable of performing quantitative                    
              morphometric and stereological measurements is essential for the               
              successful completion of the research.  Also, proposed research                
              investigating various cellular responses require fluorescence                  
              microscopy.  For example, immunofluorescence microscopy will be                
              used for the localization of specific cytoskeletal proteins and                
              to visualize and quantify subcellular features associated with                 
              target cell differentiation in abscission zones of soybean.
