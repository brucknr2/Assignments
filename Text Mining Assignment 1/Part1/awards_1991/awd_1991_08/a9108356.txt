Abstract    :
              This is a Research Initiation Award dealing with                               
              nonlinear dynamical phenomena in electric power                                
              systems.  The principal tool to be used in developing                          
              the methodology is bifurcation theory.  The                                    
              methodology will be used to formulate a performance                            
              index to predict voltage collapse and to identify weak                         
              areas in the system for possible voltage control.
