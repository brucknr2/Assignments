Abstract    :
              This is an award to support exploratory research on an                         
              innovative method of designing a fixed-bed adsorption                          
              column for removing organic pollutants from aqueous                            
              solution.  Conventional engineering design results in                          
              placement of the adsorbing media in a cylindrical                              
              configuration.  In this research, the investigator plans                       
              to experimentally evaluate the alternative of placing the                      
              adsorbent (activated carbon) in a conical, tapered-bed                         
              configuration as an alternative to batch reactors,                             
              continuous-flow stirred tank reactors and columns of                           
              fixed, fluidized or moving beds.                                               
                                                                                             
              This proposal was submitted under conditions listed in NSF                     
              89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory (SGER).  It addresses                      
              the problem resulting when organic pollutants are present                      
              in surface and groundwaters or are produced during the                         
              treatment process for polluted waters and must be removed                      
              to bring the water to acceptable standards for commercial,                     
              industrial and domestic use.  Results are expected to                          
              improve the process by which engineers approach the design                     
              of adsorption processes in treatment of water and                              
              wastewater.
