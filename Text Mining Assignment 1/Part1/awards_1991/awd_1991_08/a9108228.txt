Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program is to Dr. Alan H. Cowley of the University of Texas at                 
              Austin for fundamental work on the synthesis of novel compounds                
              containing main group elements.  The elements to be studied                    
              include E = P, As, Sb, and Bi from group 15 and M = Al, Ga, and                
              In from group 13.  The goal of the research is to prepare low                  
              coordination number fragments of RE (i.e., phosphinidenes,                     
              arsinidenes, stibinidenes, and bismuthinidenes) and RM (four                   
              electron carbenoid species) and incorporate those fragments                    
              into novel rings, clusters, and polymers or use them as                        
              ligands.  The substituent R may be methyl, ethyl, or a wide                    
              variety of bulky hydrocarbons.  The fragments will be generated                
              by thermal, photochemical or electrochemical elimination of                    
              hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, or disilane and its                 
              heavier congeners.  The project includes the synthesis of group                
              13 heterocycles, the synthesis of group 13 and group 15                        
              compounds as potential sources of ME fragments, the                            
              construction of molecules of the type (RMERR)n, where n = 1-3,                 
              with unusual geometries, and the stabilization of ME fragments                 
              by coordination to transition metals.                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              Preparation of compounds containing aluminum, gallium, or                      
              indium together with phosphorus, arsenic or antimony may result                
              in materials with interesting optical or electrical properties.                
              One goal of this research is to attach different types of                      
              groups which absorb light (chromophores) to compounds                          
              containing the pairs of elements mentioned above. Introduction                 
              of such groups could enable use of these or related compounds                  
              in the manufacture of semiconductors by photo-assisted growth.                 
              Because diffusion might be reduced and sharper junctions                       
              produced, this would be a desirable alternative to present                     
              thermal methods.
