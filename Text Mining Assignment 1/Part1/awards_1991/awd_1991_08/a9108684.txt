Abstract    :
              This exploratory research proposal will use the novel technique of             
              internal multiple Bragg scattering to address the problem of phase             
              determination of structure factors of a quasi-crystal (QC).  The QC            
              is from the Al-Cu-Fe system.  The object of the multiple scattering            
              technique is to relate changes in intensity of x-ray reflections to            
              relative phases of the structure factors involved in the multiple              
              scattering.  The technique has been used for organic crystals but              
              has not been applied to QCs.  The second part of the project deals             
              with absolute measurements of selected structure factors.  This is             
              an indispensable step towards a complete determination of atomic               
              locations.  The project will involve determination of the ratio of             
              elastic scattering to inelastic Compton scattering.  If successful,            
              the information so obtained would then be used to distinguish                  
              between competing models of QCs.//
