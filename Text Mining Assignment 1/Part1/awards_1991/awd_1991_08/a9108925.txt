Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will complete a major longitudinal study of the                  
              role of patterns of emotion expression and emotion-related                     
              behaviors in the development of temperament/personality and                    
              competencies in childhood.  The stability and predictive efficacy              
              of indexes of infants' emotion-related responses, including                    
              patterns of cardiac activity, will be evaluated across the first               
              5-1/2 years of life.  The project will have five aspects relating              
              to emotional development from birth to 5 years of age. It will                 
              study (1) stability and change in expressive behavior, (2) the                 
              construct validity of emotion variables, (3) developmental                     
              changes in emotion responses to pleasant and mildly stressful                  
              conditions. (4) development al changes in relations among emotion              
              expression variables and patterns of cardiac activity under                    
              pleasant and mildly stressful conditions, and (5) early emotion                
              variables as predictors of later socioemotional and affective-                 
              cognitive competence.  Results from the first two years of the                 
              research showed that early-infancy emotion variables were                      
              significant predictors of the quality of infant-mother attachment              
              at 13 months (an important index of socioemotional competence)                 
              and of infant temperament at 13, 18, and 24 months.  Early                     
              emotion variable s predicted significant aspects of the                        
              development of personality and social behavior.  This research                 
              will further our understanding emotional development.
