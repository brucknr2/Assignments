Abstract    :
                   This action is to support the international participants who              
              are to attend a workshop dealing with metabolic mapping                        
              techniques for brain imaging during behavioral functions.  This                
              workshop will be the first meeting to review state-of-the-art                  
              applications of a new generation of cell metabolic mapping                     
              techniques capable of visually imaging brain functions related to              
              animal learning and behavior.  The potential impact of these                   
              functional mapping techniques for elucidating brain mechanisms of              
              behavior is enormous.  This workshop brings together leaders in                
              this field from around the world and seeks to formulate                        
              recommendations for the directions of future research.
