Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The country of Ghana possesses a long tradition of democratic                  
              political thought vigorously defended by a small number of Ghana's             
              most prominent families.  When Ghana achieved its independence from            
              Britain, democracy was not established and these families faced                
              severe economic and political adversity. Nevertheless the families             
              survived and remain an influential force for democratic reform.                
                                                                                             
              This doctoral dissertation research will undertake extensive field             
              research in Ghana in an attempt to understand how these families               
              have survived in post independence Ghana.  Drawing upon theories               
              of rational choice it will attempt to understand the ways in which             
              these individuals acted to advance both their private and group                
              interests, how they withstood the attacks by the government, and               
              what strategies they used.                                                     
                                                                                             
              In addition to expanding our knowledge of African politics, this               
              study promises to increase our understanding of the relationship               
              between individual rights, egalitarianism, and economic                        
              development.
