                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              This project is designed to produce detailed descriptions of the               
              syntax and semantics of the ergative construction in four                      
              morphologically ergative languages, Basque, Greenlandic Eskimo,                
              Hindi, and Warlpiri, each of which has an ergative case system.                
              The objective is to develop, in the context of a single                        
              theoretical framework, an explanatory account of certain                       
              syntactic and semantic phenomena characteristic of this important              
              linguistic type.  The theoretical framework of the project is a                
              combination of the Government and Binding theory and a version of              
              model-theoretic semantics.  The research on the four languages                 
              systematically examines the ergative construction in relation to               
              each of the principal levels of syntactic representation--Logical              
              Form, S-structure, and D-structure--and in relation to the                     
              phenomenon of free word order, characteristic of the languages of              
              the project.  While the four language are reasonably                           
              representative of their type, the sample is restricted, and the                
              project seeks to off-set this by incorporating three ancillary                 
              activities: a survey of the literature on Mayan ergativity                     
              (represented in agreement morphology only, rather than case), a                
              semester-long seminar on ergativity, and a colloquium series on                
              ergativity.  A book on the theoretical position of                             
              morphologically ergative languages is included as an integral                  
              part of the project.
