Abstract    :
              This a Research Initiation Award dealing with the                              
              impact of load, exciter, and transformer models on the                         
              simulation of voltage collapse dynamics.  This research                        
              is expected to identify and predict conditions under                           
              which voltage instabilities are likely to occur and to                         
              develop control actions to rectify unsuitable voltage                          
              profiles.
