Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The motion of magnetic flux in the form of vortices will be studied            
              both in arrays of Josephson junctions and in thin films of high-               
              temperature superconductors.  Simulations of arrays will be made,              
              too.  These experiments will form a unique basis for determining               
              the underlying physics of vortex dynamics.
