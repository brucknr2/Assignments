Abstract    :
                   Preliminary work on the development of an active low                      
              frequency isolation system will be carried out.  This will                     
              concentrate on the building and testing of a preliminary                       
              isolation stage which will operate in at least 3 and probably                  
              6 degrees of freedom.  This will make possible a low noise                     
              environment for further developments, as well as give this                     
              University of Colorado group experience with isolation systems                 
              with multiple degrees of freedom.                                              
                   This work will lay the groundwork for the design of                       
              advanced receiver systems which may be added to the proposed                   
              Caltech/MIT Laser Interferomer Gravitational Wave Observatory                  
              (LIGO), which will probe for low frequency (1 to 100 Hz)                       
              signals.  It will also be of interest for a wide variety of                    
              precision systems in science and technology.
