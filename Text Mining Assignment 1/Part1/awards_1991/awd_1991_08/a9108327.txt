Abstract    :
              The SAGE (Soviet-American Gallium Experiment) project is an                    
              international collaboration to extract and use 60 tons of the                  
              rare element gallium to detect low-energy neutrinos from the                   
              interior of the Sun under a mountain in Baksan, Russia.  This                  
              experiment is perhaps the most critical of all solar neutrino                  
              experiments because the low-energy neutrinos are the dominant ones             
              released in nuclear fusion reactions inside the Sun. The PI is                 
              generally credited as the "father of neutrino astrophysics." This              
              one year award will permit the PI and his collaborators to                     
              enhance existing neutrino detection electronics and to consult                 
              directly with their Russian counterparts in Baksan on the                      
              progress of this experiment.
