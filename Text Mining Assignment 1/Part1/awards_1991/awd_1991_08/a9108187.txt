Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Bulgarian research                            
              project between Dr. Johannes Smid of the State University                      
              of New York College of Environmental Science and                               
              Forestry and Dr. Christo Tsvetanov of the Institute of                         
              Polymers, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, is to synthesize                      
              and evaluate hydrophilic/hydrophobic polymer gels based                        
              on polyethyleneoxide (PEO).  The main goals of this                            
              project are: 1) to synthesize and characterize hydrogel                        
              networks of polyethylene oxide containing hydrophobic                          
              sites; 2) to study the swelling behavior of gels as a                          
              function of temperature, salt and surfacant additive; 3)                       
              to establish the binding characteristics of the gels;                          
              and 4) to explore potential applications of the hydrogels.                     
              The researchers are concerned with understanding                               
              materials derived from polyethylene oxide.   Their                             
              efforts should produce information regarding compounds                         
              containing the ethylene oxide moiety.  Such information                        
              should be an important contribution to the understanding                       
              of problems related to polyethlene oxide and its many                          
              derivatives including linear and network polymers, and                         
              block and graft copolymers.                                                    
                                                                                             
              This project in polymers research fulfills the program                         
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe                        
              to combine complementary talents and pool research                             
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                               
              competence.
