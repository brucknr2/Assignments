Abstract    :
              The archaebacterium Halobacterium halobium contains intracellular              
              gas-filled vesicles that confer buoyancy to the cell.  Research                
              will be carried out on the development of a cloning vector for this            
              organism, using the plasmid which contains the genes for the gas               
              vesicles.  Studies of the loci involved with plasmid stability are             
              being undertaken in order to determine the mechanism responsible               
              for a class of vesicle mutants which are partially vac and                     
              extremely unstable.
