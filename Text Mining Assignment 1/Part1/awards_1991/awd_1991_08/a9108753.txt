Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to make a large group of machine             
              learning algorithms more useful in practice.  This research focuses on         
              formal models of machine learning, an area known as computational              
              learning theory.  The overall goal of this field is to give formal,            
              mathematical definitions of learning problems, and to provide                  
              efficient algorithms to solve these problems.                                  
              The computational learning theory community has proposed a large               
              number of algorithms for solving low-level induction problems, but             
              there are certain properties such learning algorithms must have if             
              they are going to be used in real-world software.  Practitioners, such         
              as builders of large artificial intelligence systems, have complained          
              that these algorithms require too much data to reach conclusions, and          
              are too sensitive to noise in the data.  This project will attempt to          
              prove that much less data is necessary for average cases than the              
              estimates given by theorists for the worst case, and to study how such         
              algorithms can be modified to resist noise.                                    
              The proposed project consists of the design and analysis of                    
              algorithms, and is essentially mathematical in nature.  Nevertheless,          
              if successful, this project should allow the practical application of          
              recently developed machine learning algorithms.
