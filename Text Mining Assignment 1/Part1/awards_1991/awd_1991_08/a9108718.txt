Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The CORF plays an essential role in defending the spectrum related             
              interests of the U.S. scientific community before national and                 
              international organizations that deal with the allocation and                  
              efficient use of the radio spectrum.  During the past year the CORF            
              filed comments before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)              
              on matters related to the upcoming World Administrative Radio                  
              Conference (WARC-92), and spurious emissions and participation in              
              the national and international preparations for the WARC.  The                 
              CORF, through it's liaison member also participates in the work                
              of the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR).  CCIR                
              Reports and Recommendations provide the technical underpinnings for            
              the protection of radio astronomy from interference from active                
              radio services.
