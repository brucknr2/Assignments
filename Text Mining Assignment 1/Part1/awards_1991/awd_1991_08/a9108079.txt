Abstract    :
              The objective of this conference is to explore the role of                     
              biotechnology in minerals and fossil-fuels processing, and                     
              to determine the direction of future research in mineral                       
              bioprocessing.  It is planned to have seven different                          
              technical sessions covering all the major and targeted                         
              areas.  Anticipated participants will be from academia,                        
              government, and industry.  At the end of the conference,                       
              proceedings covering all the technical presentations,                          
              panel discussions, and future research directions in                           
              minerals and fossil-fuels bioprocessing will be published.
