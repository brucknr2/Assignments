Abstract    :
                   This grant provides support for an Ohio State University                  
              faculty member in his studies of the spin-isospin degrees of                   
              freedom in nuclei.  The experiments utilize the charge-                        
              exchange reaction in which the neutron ejectile energy is                      
              measured using the time-of-flight method.  The investigations                  
              will provide unique information on a variety of topics such as                 
              Gamow-Teller distributions, nuclear capture cross sections for                 
              solar/galactic neutrinos, and properties of the nuclear force                  
              at intermediate energies.
