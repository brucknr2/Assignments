Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the choice                     
              between neural and epidermal cell determination will be studied                
              in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  Eleven extant                      
              mutations that affect eye development through modifying the                    
              phenotypic effects of the "Split" allele of the "Notch" locus,                 
              alone or in combination with the "Enhancer of split" mutation                  
              will be characterized.  These studies have the potential of                    
              identifying intracellular mechanisms required for neuronal cell                
              determination.
