Abstract    :
              This award provides group travel support to attend a symposium to              
              discuss the achievements in the area of the "Mechanisms of Ductile             
              Fracture and Fatigue", and to offer future directions for new                  
              research.  The award also covers the costs associated with the                 
              publication of a monograph which will result from the presentations            
              of the symposium.
