Abstract    :
              The objective of this study is to                                              
              gain a fundamental understanding of                                            
              the relationship between drug                                                  
              transport properties and matrix

              systems is critical to realizing                                               
              the therapeutic potential of many                                              
              new polypeptides being developed by                                            
              the biotechnology industry.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The goals of this study are:  i) to                                            
              define the relationship between                                                
              matrix composition and matrix pore                                             
              sizes; and ii) to define the                                                   
              relationship between pore sizes and                                            
              polypeptide diffusion rates.
