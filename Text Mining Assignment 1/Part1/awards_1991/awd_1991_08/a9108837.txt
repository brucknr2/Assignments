Abstract    :
              This award supports collaboration on polycarbonate/epoxy                       
              copolymers and coating systems between James Bell, University of               
              Connecticut and Yu Yunchao, Chinese Academy of Sciences'                       
              Institute of Chemistry.  Polycarbonate is widely used for optical              
              applications such as windows in airplanes and trains, or for                   
              eyeglasses, but has poor scratch and abrasion resistance.                      
              Epoxies are considerably harder, but do not have the toughness                 
              and impact resistance of polycarbonate.  In this proposal, the                 
              mechanical and chemical properties of epoxy-polycarbonate reacted              
              systems will be investigated, as will the properties of reacted                
              epoxy coatings on solid polycarbonate.                                         
                                                                                             
              This research could lead to an improved composite with both                    
              toughness and surface hardness and should help illuminate the                  
              mechanism of toughening of high glass transition temperature                   
              polymers.
