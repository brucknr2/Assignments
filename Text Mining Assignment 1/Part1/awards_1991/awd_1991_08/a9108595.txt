Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The behavior of aqueous and other associating solutions is to be               
              modeled with a technique based on exact relations among the direct             
              correlation function integrals of mixtures.  For example, for a                
              binary mixture only one of the three direct correlation function               
              integrals is independent.  Closure expressions will be derived for             
              the cross direct correlation function integrals for these                      
              associating solutions.  With these closure expressions, analytic               
              expressions for activity coefficients and equations of state which             
              are applicable for both vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria,             
              at infinite dilution and finite concentration, will be derived.                
              The formulation does not require a knowledge of the intermolecular             
              potential, but it does require some experimental data with which               
              to determine binary parameters.
