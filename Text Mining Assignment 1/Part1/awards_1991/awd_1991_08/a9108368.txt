Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research examines factors leading to breakdown of protective              
              passive films on metals.  Sophisticated experimental methods are               
              used to follow the effects of hydrogen and chloride anions in film             
              deterioration.  Neutron reflectivity studies are carried out on                
              mirror-smooth alloy surfaces of iron and iron-chromium alloys to               
              determine how hydrogen is distributed in the passive films and the             
              manner of breakdown of passivity in the films.  EXAFS (Extended X-             
              ray Absorption Fine Structure) analysis in conjunction with a                  
              photocathode proportional counter detector is used to determine the            
              presence of damaging anions in the passive film surface.  The                  
              effect of chromium content in iron alloys on passive film                      
              properties relevant to film breakdown is studied by anodic                     
              polarization in buffered borate solutions.  These data are                     
              incorporated into a model of the passive film breakdown process.               
              %%%                                                                            
              The passivity of non-noble metals and their alloys is the basis for            
              the successful application of metallic materials in technologies               
              where they are exposed to aqueous environments.  The special film              
              that forms on the surfaces of metals, the passive film, enables                
              them to resist corrosion failure.  Detailed knowledge is needed on             
              how alloying constituents affect the structure, composition, and               
              electronic properties of passive films to improve the corrosion                
              resistance of metal alloys.
