Abstract    :
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                     
              (EPSCoR) in the state of Arkansas will enhance the research                    
              competitiveness of approximately 35 scientists in three                        
              research clusters: (1) Arkansas Neurobiology Research                          
              Center; (2) Center for Cellular and Molecular Studies on                       
              Biological Aging; and (3) Center for Protein Dynamics.                         
              Arkansas' effort is directed toward bringing three groups of                   
              scientists to a nationally-competitive level by funding                        
              equipment, graduate students, common facilities, and post-                     
              doctoral scientists, and by recruiting new faculty members.                    
              Outreach components of each group will draw undergraduate                      
              students and faculty from other institutions in the state to                   
              conduct research under as the direction of the nationally-                     
              competitive group leaders.   In addition to the clusters'                      
              outreach programs, the statewide EPSCoR Committee will                         
              administer the Visiting Scientists Program, providing                          
              funding for continued research at primarily undergraduate                      
              institutions.  A Public Awareness Program is funding the                       
              production of six half-hour documentaries featuring Arkansas                   
              scientists.  These documentaries, produced by the Arkansas                     
              Educational Television Network, will be shown on the public                    
              television stations and include corresponding educational                      
              materials so that the programs may be used in the public                       
              schools.  During the three year period of the award, state                     
              and institutions will contribute $3 million in support of                      
              EPSCoR'S objectives.
