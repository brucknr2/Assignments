Abstract    :
              This research is an empirical investigation of female labor supply.            
              The first part focuses upon how experience on the job affects                  
              future wages and labor supply decisions; the second part looks at              
              joint labor supply decisions taken by married couples.  The                    
              estimation is complicated by the fact that labor market conditions             
              change with the business cycle, fluctuations that affect the                   
              decisions of individuals and households, which in turn feed forward            
              into future wage and employment rates.  Since previous research has            
              largely ignored this dynamic phenomenon, an important component of             
              the research is to develop econometric techniques from the                     
              underlying economic framework which can implement with the proposed            
              empirical strategy.  This research is important because it will                
              provide a deeper understanding of factors that affect the                      
              participation and success of women in the labor market.
