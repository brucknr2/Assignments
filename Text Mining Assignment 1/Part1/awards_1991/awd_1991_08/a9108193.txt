Abstract    :
                   An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change              
              Research Program (Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth                     
              Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                     
              environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                   
              Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                    
              Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                
              initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                
              of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                 
              properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                
              geospace model with predictive capability.                                     
                   The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                            
              magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                  
              connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                  
              ionosphere.  This grant is to use a large statistical database of              
              precipitating particle data (developed by the PI) to produce                   
              mapping of ionospheric signatures of magnetospheric boundary                   
              processes.
