Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to extend the existing economic                 
              analysis of environmental problems from an essentially domestic                
              perspective to one that incorporates explicitly the issues arising             
              in an international economy linked by trade, financial, and                    
              environmental flows.  The point of departure for this research is              
              a general conceptual framework that sets out the international                 
              gains from trade in environmental services.  The specific research             
              agenda addresses the issues of:  (1) the international transport               
              and disposal of hazardous wastes;  (2) the role of developing                  
              countries in the management of the global environment,  (3) the                
              design and implementation of global measures for environmental                 
              regulation,  and  (4) the potential for using trade measures to                
              penalize and provide inducements to countries that ignore the                  
              broader social costs of their economic activities.  A central theme            
              running through this research is the importance of distortions in              
              world prices and their implications for realizing the potential                
              gains from trade in environmental services.
