Abstract    :
              This Science in Developing Countries award will                                
              support participation by u.S. and Latin American                               
              researchers in a Research Workshop on Science and                              
              the State, to be held in Los Angeles, California,                              
              February 27-29, 1992.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Economic crisis in Latin America has forced both                               
              urban and rural households to explore ways to survive.                         
              These strategies include women entering the labor                              
              market in growing numbers, micro-enterprises,                                  
              production cooperatives, and community-based emergency                         
              organizations.  This new community activism, in which                          
              women have been prominent, has given rise to                                   
              substantial research by Latin and North American                               
              scholars.  This workshop will bring together 21                                
              regional scholars from various disciplines to discuss                          
              current topics and compare North and South American                            
              perspectives.  It will also explore how responses of                           
              Latin American women to persistent poverty pertain to                          
              U.S. poverty workers.  Participants will meet with                             
              leaders of Los Angeles Latina communities and discuss                          
              women's experiences in confronting poverty through                             
              local efforts to ensure the social reproduction of new                         
              immigrant households.
