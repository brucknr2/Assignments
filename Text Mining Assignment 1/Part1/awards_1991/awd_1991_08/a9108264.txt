Abstract    :
              David Waldeck is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and                 
              Computational Chemistry Program to study solvent-solute                        
              interactions and their influence on solute reorientation in                    
              solution.  Waldeck will employ a number of unique non-linear                   
              spectroscopic techniques to measure the rotational correlation                 
              function of the solute.  These experiments will be used to gain                
              important inights into the orientation and temporal evolution                  
              of the solute-solvent complex, and the frictional forces which                 
              a solute molecule experiences in solution.                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Successful completion of these studies will result in an                       
              improved molecular level understanding of solute-solvent                       
              friction, the motion of solute molecules in solution, and the                  
              effects of solute-solvent interactions on chemical reactivity.
