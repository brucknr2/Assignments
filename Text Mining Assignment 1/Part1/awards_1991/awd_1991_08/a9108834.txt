Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds a search for, and study of, quasars at very high              
              redshifts.  Dr. Schmidt, the Principal Investigator, is one of the             
              world leaders in such studies.  He aims in this work to investigate            
              the apparent decrease in the density of quasars at redshifts                   
              greater than three, an effect which he discovered in previous                  
              investigations.  This may indicate that we are here observing the              
              initial period of birth of the quasars, and probably that of                   
              galaxies as well.
