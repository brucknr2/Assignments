Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a 3-year continuing award.  The                      
              research consists of the design, analysis, and implementation of               
              efficient algorithms and paradigms to solve problems in image                  
              analysis and computational geometry on massively parallel                      
              computers.  The focus of the algorithm development will be on                  
              fine-grained distributed memory topologies for which commercially              
              available machines or prototypes already exit.  These include the              
              mesh, hypercube, pyramid, and reconfigurable mesh.  The                        
              concentration will be on problems with application to robotics                 
              and image processing.  Initially, the following will be                        
              considered:  2-and 3-dimensional problems in intermediate-level                
              image analysis, as well as 2- and 3-dimensional problems in                    
              computational geometry.  The optimality of all of the problems                 
              considered ar currently open problems on the appropriate                       
              architectures.  Further, it does not appear that for the problems              
              considered, algorithms for 2-dimensional objects can be extended               
              to solve the problems for 3-dimensional objects in optimal time.               
              Rather, it appears that radically different approaches will be                 
              required.  The problems considered involve connectivity,                       
              proximity, area, intersection, and minimal-area enclosing                      
              polygons, to name a few.
