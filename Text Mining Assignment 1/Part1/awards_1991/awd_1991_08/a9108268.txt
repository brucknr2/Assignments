Abstract    :
              The Bromeliaceae (Pineapple Family) is an important component of               
              the vascular epiphyte flora of the New World tropics and                       
              subtropics.  The family, which contains an estimated 2,500 species,            
              is generally considered to be monophyletic, and recent molecular               
              studies indicate that subfamily Tillandsioideae (with the genus                
              Glomeropitcairnia removed) is also monophyletic.  In contrast, four            
              of the five remaining genera within the subfamily (Tillandsia,                 
              Vriesea, Guzmania, Mezobromelia), which encompass over 800 species,            
              represent artificial groupings based on just one or two characters.            
              Recent morphological and preliminary chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) data              
              suggest that the fifth genus, Catopsis, is monophyletic.  The                  
              objective of this research is to construct generic level                       
              phylogenetic hypotheses for subfamily Tillandsioideae using cpDNA              
              restriction site data obtained from a group of selected,                       
              representative species.  This molecular phylogeny will be used to              
              evaluate morphological character state changes within                          
              Tillandsioideae, as well as form the framework for future                      
              phylogenetically based generic level taxonomic revisions within the            
              subfamily.
