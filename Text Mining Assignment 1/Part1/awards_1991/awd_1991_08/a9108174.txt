Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the North Carolina SuperQuest competition for              
              1991.  The objective of the competition is to introduce                        
              computational science into the classroom at all educational levels             
              and to encourage more student interest in studies and careers in               
              science, engineering and mathematics.  All of the high schools in              
              North Carolina were invited to enter the competition.  The                     
              competing teams will consist of four students and two teachers.                
              The subject matter will be a scientifically sound and                          
              computationally challenging problem that they can solve using the              
              supercomputing resources at the North Carolina Supercomputing                  
              Center (NCSC).  There will be five winning teams.  These teams will            
              attend a 2 and 1/2 week summer institute at NCSC in June, 1991.                
              During the Summer Institute the 20 students and 10 teachers will               
              be trained to use the NCSC supercomputing resources and graphics               
              workstations available at NCSC to design a computational solution              
              to the problem they have proposed.
