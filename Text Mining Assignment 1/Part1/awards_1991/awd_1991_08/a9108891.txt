Abstract    :
              The objective of this RIA research is to improve the elevated                  
              temperature fracture resistance of alumina ceramics by adding                  
              various amounts of glass-forming silica to the composition.  It is             
              expected that the glassy phase will aid in crack bridging at                   
              elevated temperature and thereby improve toughness.  A detailed                
              study of elevated temperature fatigue and creep crack growth will              
              be made and the results correlated with microstructure and                     
              composition in order to identify the governing mechanisms.
