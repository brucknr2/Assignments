Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, the Logan Museum of                  
              Anthropology at Beloit College will conserve its important Old                 
              World archaeology collection.  It will renovate existing space to              
              create a clean, secure and environmentally stable storage and                  
              research area.  The collection will be inventoried and                         
              reorganized to make it accessible for modern research methods.                 
              New conservationally sound storage cabinets will be purchased to               
              house the collections and the extensive original documentation                 
              will be preserved through archival processing and duplication.  A              
              guide to documentation will be prepared to enable researchers to               
              make full use of the resource.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The collection consists of Old World archaeological material                   
              systematically assembled as instructional material for the                     
              teaching of archaeology to students of Beloit College.  It                     
              includes over 90,000 individual specimens of stone and bone tools              
              and faunal remains representing 152 sites in 10 European and                   
              North African countries. A wide range of time - in excess of one               
              million years - is represented and it constitutes a valuable                   
              scientific resource.  Of special significance are European Upper               
              Paleolithic materials for these include art objects which                      
              document the emergence of modern human culture.                                
                                                                                             
              Because of the way they have been curated, these specimens are in              
              danger of deterioration and it is difficult for scientists to                  
              study them.  With NSF funds the materials will be securely housed              
              and made maximally available for research.
