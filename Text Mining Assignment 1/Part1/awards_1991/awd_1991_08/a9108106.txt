Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ovulation is a universal phenomenon in the animal kingdom.                     
              However, this process is poorly understood.  It is known that a                
              hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), produced by the pituitary                   
              induces a number of changes in the follicular wall which results               
              in a rupture of this wall and release of the egg or ovum.  The                 
              follicular wall consists of a thick matrix which must be degraded              
              to permit ovulation.  To facilitate ovulation, the follicular wall             
              has a specialized region called a stigma in which the fibers are               
              arranged in a parallel manner.  Based on studies in others species,            
              it is hypothesized that enzymes, such as tissue plasminogen                    
              activator and collagenase, either dissociate or degrade the fibers             
              in the stigma region.  The purpose of this study is to measure the             
              activities of these two key enzymes in the follicle as it ap-                  
              proaches ovulation.  Knowledge obtained from these studies will                
              promote an understanding of the mechanisms by which LH brings about            
              time controlled changes in the follicular wall so that ovulation               
              occurs at a predictable time.                                  //
