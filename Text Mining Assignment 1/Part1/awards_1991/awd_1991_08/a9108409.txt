Abstract    :
                   This research contains two major research themes, both                    
              overlapping statistics and probability.  Traditional statistical               
              methods relying on parametric models are limited by the                        
              restriction of parameters to a subset of Euclidean space, while                
              nonparametric models begin to break down when the data is high-                
              dimensional because of a lack of structure or restriction.  This               
              research will investigate semiparametric models which lie between              
              the two extremes by defining a class of models with sum tangent                
              spaces.  For this class, statistical questions about efficiency,               
              hypothesis testing, estimation and applications to various kinds               
              of censored or truncated data will be addressed.                               
                   Probability research will focus on Donsker classes of                     
              functions and their properties, the application of the Donsker                 
              property for ellipsoidal classes in the construction of tests                  
              based on empirical measures, and the implications of                           
              bootstrapping empirical processes.
