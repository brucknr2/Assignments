Abstract    :
                   This project will study the relations between nonlinear                   
              realizability and the existence of input-output equations.  This               
              will include realizability by nonsingular rational systems,                    
              analytic realizability, efficient algorithms, and relationships                
              between realizability and integral input-output equations.                     
              Techniques borrowed from algebraic and differential geometry will              
              be often used.                                                                 
                   These studies address fundamental questions in the modeling               
              of control of mechanical, electrical, and biological systems.
