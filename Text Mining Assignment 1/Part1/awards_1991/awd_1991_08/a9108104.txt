Abstract    :
              This project will focus upon the structure, function and                       
              genetics of protein and RNA components of the prokaryotic                      
              ribosome.  (1) The structural features within E. coli 16S and                  
              23S rRNAs that account for their specific interaction with r-                  
              proteins S8 and L1 during ribosome assembly will be probed by                  
              site-directed mutagenesis and protein-rRNA cross-linking.  In                  
              addition, the minimum rRNA segment required for protein                        
              binding will be determined to facilitate their detailed                        
              physical characterization in the future.  (2) Over 40 mutants                  
              of E. coli r-protein S8 have been isolated on the basis of                     
              their inability to translationally regulate spc operon                         
              expression. The metabolic and physically stability of these                    
              proteins will be examined, and their RNA-binding properties                    
              evaluated.  2D NMR analysis of wild-type and mutants S8 will                   
              be used to define the structure of S8, and its RNA-binding                     
              domain, at high resolution.  (3) Operons encoding components                   
              of the translation and transcription apparatus in several                      
              thermoacidophilic archaebacteria will be isolated and                          
              sequenced.  Various approaches will be employed to gain                        
              insights into how the expression of these transcription units                  
              is controlled.  The results will provide a better                              
              understanding of the evolution of gene regulation, as well as                  
              of gene organization, in this unusual group of organisms.
