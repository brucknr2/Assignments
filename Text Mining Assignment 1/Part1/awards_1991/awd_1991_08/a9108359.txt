Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a three year continuing award.  This                 
              research addresses the problems of modeling at the appropriate                 
              level of detail for the purpose of controlling physical or                     
              biological systems under time or computation resources                         
              constraints.  The research is to develop, implement and test a                 
              method of dynamic selection of models for use in real-time                     
              applications.  The PI's first develop and organize multiple                    
              simplifications of a detailed (base) model of the domain by                    
              applying combinations of domain-specific simplifying assumptions.              
              They create an explicit representation of these assumptions and                
              develop methods to reason dynamically with the assumptions to                  
              find the simplest model with valid assumptions.  The PI's test                 
              the hypothesis that the simplest model with valid assumptions is               
              optimal according to a decision-theoretic definition of                        
              optimality.  The system is implemented in the domain of human                  
              cardiopulmonary physiology, with the control task of finding                   
              settings for a ventilator (mechanical breathing device).  The                  
              research will provide improved methods of applying complex models              
              in time-critical applications, enable the use of previously                    
              intractable models in real-time applications, and merge numeric                
              simulation and control methodologies with formal decision theory.
