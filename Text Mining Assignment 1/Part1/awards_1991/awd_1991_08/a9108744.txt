Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The field of behavioral genetics has demonstrated that heredity                
              influences differences among people for many aspects of behavior,              
              including cognitive abilities, personality, and psychopathology.               
              However, little is known about the extent to which genetic                     
              factors influence behavioral interactions for pairs of                         
              individuals.  From the perspective of child development, some of               
              the most important interactions are those within the family, yet               
              essentially nothing is known about such family relationships from              
              the perspective of behavioral genetics.                                        
                                                                                             
              This research will extend into early adolescence the Colorado                  
              Sibling Study (CSS) which focuses on the social environment of                 
              familial and extra-familial relationships.  The CSS has                        
              previously studied family relationships for nonadoptive and                    
              adoptive siblings in early and middle childhood.  This research                
              on early adolescence will investigate nonshared environment and                
              genetic influence on parent and sibling relationships.                         
                                                                                             
              This study is embedded within the long-term Colorado Adoption                  
              Project, which makes it possible to study antecedents and                      
              consequences of family relationships and to consider the role of               
              heredity in these associations.
