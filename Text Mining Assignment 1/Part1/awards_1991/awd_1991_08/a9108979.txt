Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is to support the travel costs of American scientists              
              to attend the XIII International Congress of Phonetic Sciences.                
              The meeting will be held in Aix-en Province, France, August 19 -               
              24, 1991.  This international meeting brings together leading                  
              scientists from around the world to present their data and                     
              discuss ideas on phonetics, speech synthesis, phonology,                       
              perception and cognitive processes.  This congress should be very              
              rewarding since it provides a congenial atmosphere for the                     
              sharing and exchange of scientific ideas and information.
