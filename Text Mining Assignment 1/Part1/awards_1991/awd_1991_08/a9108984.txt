Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to update and rewrite the                          
              Transportation Research Board Special Report 176:                              
              Landslides-Analysis and Control, initially published in                        
              1978. This publication has already achieved an excellent                       
              reputation worldwide as a highway design text, and a                           
              repected reference for academics, researchers and                              
              practitioners. The intent of this project is to include in                     
              the manuscript the significant changes and advances that                       
              have been made in methods of field investigation and                           
              instrumentation, slope stability analysis, and design and                      
              construction of soil slopes during the past ten years.
