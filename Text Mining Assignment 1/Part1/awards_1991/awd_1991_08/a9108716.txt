Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project studies diversity in size and character of welfare                
              state provisions in 19 industrial democracies in the post World                
              War II period.  Investigators hope to identify social, economic,               
              political, and demographic factors accounting for the diversity.               
              Further, they will link the determinants and form of welfare                   
              state provisions to effects on the distribution of income and on               
              living conditions in a subset of the countries.  The research                  
              combines comparative historical analysis, quantitative cross-                  
              national analysis of aggregate data, and analysis of individual                
              level data on income and living conditions.  Its virtues include               
              going beyond welfare expenditures and income inequality as                     
              variables of interest to create data usable for testing general                
              scientific hypotheses about the functioning of welfare expen-                  
              ditures.  Thus the project will permit measuring, rather than                  
              just assuming, what effects welfare planning and spending have.                
              Results bear on sociological theories of state development and                 
              stratification, and have implications for income redistribution                
              policies.
