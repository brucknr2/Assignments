Abstract    :
                   Professor Wenzl will continue his previous research using                 
              braid groups to construct interesting examples of subfactors of                
              certain factors of von Neumann algebras.  The following points will            
              be emphasized: (a) It is planned to find a simpler and more                    
              conceptual approach to these examples using the theory of quantum              
              groups more explicitly.  Moreover, the braid groups will be used to            
              construct other interesting subfactors.  (b) Quantum groups also               
              played an important role in the proof of the existence of certain              
              invariants of 3-manifolds.  Professor Wenzl plans to extend the                
              approach used in this construction to treat not only the quantized             
              Lie algebra of the special linear group in two dimensions, but all             
              the classical Lie algebras.                                                    
                   Professor Wenzl's research is in the area of self-adjoint                 
              operator algebras.  These are families of operators (infinite                  
              dimensional matrices) with a certain reality condition imposed to              
              make the algebras self-adjoint.  Recent discoveries involving how              
              one of these algebras sits inside another have brought together a              
              bewildering variety of fields and have added immeasurably to our               
              knowledge about these fields.  Professor Wenzl's project will                  
              contribute to these developments.
