Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will explore the degree to which the basic                       
              cognitive functions of memory and categorization are adapted to                
              the structure of the environment.  It is based on the hypotheses               
              that human memory functions to make most available that                        
              information which is most likely to be needed in the current                   
              context and that we form categories of objects to maximize our                 
              ability to make predictions about new objects.  In the case of                 
              memory, the research will explore how the need for information                 
              varies with the pattern of past use of that information and the                
              cues available in the environment.  The environments to be                     
              explored will be both linguistic environments such as newspapers               
              and biological environments as recorded in animal counts.                      
              Experiments will determine whether availability of information in              
              memory varies in the same way as need for that information varies              
              in the environment.  In the case of categorization, the research               
              will explore how features cluster across objects in our                        
              environment.  The environments to be explored will be various                  
              data sets that have been gathered in the machine learning                      
              research on categorization.  Experiments will determine if human               
              predictions of object features show sensitivity to the same                    
              variables that are predictive in these environments.  The theory               
              to be developed will tie the two domains of memory and                         
              categorization together as two manifestations of cognition's                   
              effort to come up with accurate models of its environment.  This               
              research, with its adaptive focus, should allow us to better                   
              understanding function and disfunction of human memory.
