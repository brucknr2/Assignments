Abstract    :
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                     
              (EPSCoR) in the state of Oklahoma will enhance the research                    
              competitiveness of approximately 32 investigators in five                      
              research clusters.  The research clusters include: (1)                         
              Multidisciplinary Approach to Molecular Analysis of Plant                      
              Biotic Stress; (2) Surface Hydrology; (3) Rock-Fluid                           
              Interactions in Crustal Rocks; (4) Advanced Materials for                      
              Photonics, Lasers, and Electro-optics (AMPLE); and (5)                         
              Laboratory for Electronic Properties of Materials.  The                        
              participating research universities, Oklahoma State                            
              University, University of Oklahoma, and University of Tulsa,                   
              will strengthen their research infrastructure during the                       
              present EPSCoR grant through (1) an increase in faculty, (2)                   
              establishment of an endowed chair program, (3) an investment                   
              in research of over $65 million during 1985-90 through                         
              Oklahoma Center for Advancement of Science and Technology,                     
              (4) assistance in the relocation of technology-sensitive                       
              industry to Oklahoma, (5) establishment of three Centers of                    
              Excellence and (6) special programs to increase research                       
              competitiveness of faculty.  The State and institutions will                   
              contribute over $2.6 million in support of the EPSCoR                          
              effort.
