Abstract    :
              Research in parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) protocols is             
              characterized by a large number of unrelated empirical studies, a              
              small set of analytic studies and to date no realizable approach that          
              is optimal or universally practical.  This research project is                 
              extending a framework incorporating a low-cost network that supports           
              rapid dissemination of critical synchronization information.                   
              Such a framework should, at a minimum, provide speed-ups for all               
              existing protocols.  More promising, however, is its potential to              
              support adaptive protocols-those that employ aggressive processing             
              selectively.  Among all protocols, these have the greatest likelihood          
              of having provably minimal expected execution times.  Success in this          
              research could lead to the construction of PDES engines that would             
              simulate arbitrary applications in minimum expected execution times.           
              Further benefits could be gained from framework-supported,                     
              application-dependent performance enhancements based on "look-ahead"           
              and "future lists."
