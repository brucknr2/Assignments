Abstract    :
              This oceanographic instrumentation development project is                      
              the first step towards the design and field testing of a                       
              moored instrument array to allow measurement of Total                          
              System Metabolism (TSM) in coastal waters and estuaries.                       
              The new capability will allow the application of TSM                           
              measurement techniques in complex hydrographic conditions                      
              where they have previously been impractical.  The test                         
              mooring will have closely spaced pulsed oxygen sensors and                     
              other probes.  Data will be collected and stored for                           
              periods up to thirty days.  The goal is to test the                            
              sensors' long-term stability and accuracy and whether                          
              frequent vertical profiles of oxygen partial pressure can                      
              be made with sufficient resolution to construct mass                           
              balances of oxygen within a defined study area.  The work                      
              will provide conclusive evidence as to the usefulness of                       
              pulsed oxygen sensors on moorings and other long-term                          
              remote applications.
