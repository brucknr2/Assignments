Abstract    :
              The proposed conference is the second of a planned series on snow              
              engineering that began in 1988.  These meetings provide a forum for            
              engineers, architects, and scientists to discuss investigative and             
              design methods to mitigate natural hazards imposed by snow on                  
              buildings and other structures.  The nature, distribution, and                 
              statistics of snow loads must be better understood to improve                  
              building design criteria and mitigate damage.                                  
                                                                                             
              The conference will attract people from a wide diversity of                    
              backgrounds and provide a unique setting for interchanging ideas,              
              opinions, and working knowledge of snow engineering.  Using series             
              of plenary sessions, workshops, poster sessions, and panel                     
              discussions participants will discuss field measurements, wind                 
              tunnel studies, artificial environments, analytical methods, snow              
              mechanics, as well as design problems and building standards/codes.            
              The conference proceedings will contain papers by invited speakers,            
              workshop position papers, short poster papers, and transcripts of              
              panel discussions.
