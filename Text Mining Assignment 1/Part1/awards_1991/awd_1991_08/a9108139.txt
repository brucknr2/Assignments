                   These meetings are important to the national research and

              appropriate.  The PI will use FARNET, the organization of U. S.                
              academic and research network operators and providers, to publicize            
              the availability of assistance to prospective conference attendees,            
              and to select the persons to receive assistance.  Only partial                 
              subsidies to approximately 34 attendees are planned.
