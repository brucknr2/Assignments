Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Zwier will use multiphoton spectroscopic                   
              techniques to study the unimolecular decomposition dynamics of                 
              benzene-water clusters and their ions.  The data obtained will                 
              allow determination of structural information from the                         
              rotational envelopes and vibrational information about van der                 
              Waals modes.  The main effort will focus on neutral clusters                   
              with from one to fifty water molecules attached.                               
              Photofragmentation and photochemical studies of ionized                        
              benzene-water clusters will also be explored.

              A study of the hydrophobic interaction between non-polar                       
              hydrocarbons and water is one of the most important forces in                  
              nature which plays a role in the conformations of proteins.  It                
              is also central to the formation of micelles and biological                    
              membranes.  The current study of clusters composed of benzene                  
              and water molecules will provide some understanding of the                     
              hydrophobic forces involved and will provide a better                          
              understanding of forces which determine conformational changes                 
              in biological systems.
