Abstract    :
                   The major goal of this project is to study the molecular                  
              mechanisms of learning and memory.  The approach consists of                   
              isolating single-gene mutations that affect learning and memory                
              in Drosophila, followed by cloning of the genes to understand                  
              their functions and regulations.  In parallel, biochemical                     
              studies of normal and mutant flies can help to determine the                   
              physiological pathways involved with learning in flies.  The work              
              performed by Dr. Timothy Tully is exploratory in nature since it               
              will make use of Polymerase Chain Reaction technology to isolate               
              and identify new amnesiac alleles with the use of a commonly used              
              mutagen.  Characterization of the gene products of these alleles               
              will potentially provide new insight specific to memory, and                   
              studies of its interaction with other gene products may outline                
              the relationship between learning and memory.
