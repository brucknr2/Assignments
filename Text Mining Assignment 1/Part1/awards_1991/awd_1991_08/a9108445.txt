Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary purpose of this proposal is to gather fossils which                
              will increase our knowledge of the early evolution of the higher               
              primates.  The Fayum region of Egypt is the richest fossiliferous              
              area known for this time period and Simons has discovered a new                
              site in the Fayum, L-41, which promises to produce skulls, limb                
              bones and associated skeletons of primates.                                    
                                                                                             
              To date, the Fayum has yielded fossils which represent at least                
              11 genera of primates, including the earliest monkeys and apes.                
              Additionally, the earliest representatives of the tarsioids and                
              lorisoids are from this region as are the earliest omomyids, a                 
              primate group which went extinct without issue.                                
                                                                                             
              The remains which undoubtedly will be found at L-41 promise to                 
              help resolve our picture of the diversity and evolution of the                 
              primates during a key period in their history.
