Abstract    :
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                     
              (EPSCoR) in the state of Kentucky will enhance the research                    
              competitiveness of approximately 64 faculty within 19                          
              departments at three universities (University of Kentucky,                     
              University of Louisville, and Western Kentucky University).                    
              Research areas include:  (1) Developing a Center for                           
              Evolutionary Ecology; (2) Biofunctional Membranes; (3)                         
              Structural Biology of Cellular Regulators; (4) Applications of                 
              Massively Parallel Computers; (5) Radiation, Turbulence, and                   
              Chemical Kinetics Interactions in Flames; (6) Inverse Problems                 
              and Quantitative Non-destructive Evaluation; (7) The                           
              Relationship Between Structure and Activity in Chemical                        
              Catalysis;  Synthesis, Structure, and Function; (8) Local                      
              Approach to Study the Properties of Complex Systems with Low                   
              Symmetry; and (9) Preparation and Properties of Low-                           
              Dimensional Conductors and their Intercalates.  The research                   
              clusters will serve over one hundred graduate, undergraduate,                  
              and post doctoral students.  In addition, EPSCoR outreach                      
              activities are linked with the existing educational enrichment                 
              programs in the state in which cluster members are actively                    
              involved (e.g., the Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in                  
              Engineering at the University of Louisville; SuperQuest; and                   
              the Minority High School Research Apprenticeship Program).                     
              The State of Kentucky will contribute over $11 million in                      
              support of the EPSCoR initiative.
