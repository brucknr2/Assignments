Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A seismometer based on high-temperature superconductivity                 
              (HTSC) is proposed.  The seismometers will remain on scale during              
              ground accelerations as great as 1 g, and will resolve ground noise            
              over a frequency range extending approximately from 10-4 hertz to              
              200 hertz.  This performance regime may ultimately be extended to              
              include periods of months and frequencies up to one kilohertz.                 
                                                                                             
                   The HTSC seismometer will be the first single instrument                  
              capable of detecting virtually the entire spectrum of seismic                  
              phenomena.  This full-range seismometer will have broad                        
              applications in seismic observatories and networks, as well as                 
              special applications in nuclear test monitoring and high-frequency             
              seismometry.  By playing the roles of several conventional                     
              instruments, the HTSC seismometer will reduce the overall cost of              
              many seismic installations.                                                    
                                                                                             
                   The performance advantages of the HTSC seismometer will be                
              achieved by exploiting the inherent sensitivity and stability of               
              a displacement transducer based on modulations of the resonance                
              frequency a high-Q superconducting tan circuit.  The use of this               
              transducer will simplify and miniaturize the suspension system of              
              the proof mass, as well as allowing the seismometer to resolve                 
              ground noise at increased frequencies.  The displacement transducer            
              will require no advances in HTSC technology.                                   
                                                                                             
                   The use of high-temperature superconductors will allow the                
              HTSC seismometer to operate downhole for periods of weeks or months            
              without replenishment of cryogens.
