Abstract    :
                   Professor Salamanca Riba will investigate various topics in               
              the theory of unitary representations of reductive Lie groups.                 
              Firstly, she will attempt to complete a proof of a conjecture of               
              Zuckerman that certain Harish-Chandra modules are isomorphic to                
              Zuckerman functor modules.  In addition she will consider other                
              generalizations of the above conjecture. For example, in certain               
              cases Barbasch and Vogan have conjectured that these derived                   
              functor modules are obtained from a special unipotent                          
              representation.  Professor Salamanca Riba will attempt to prove                
              this.                                                                          
                   The research project being described here is in group                     
              representation theory.  Groups usually arise as transformations                
              which preserve the structure of a system under investigation, as               
              for example the group of rotations around the center preserves a               
              sphere.  In specific applications a concrete realization of the                
              abstract group, or representation, is often needed.  These are the             
              objects which are being studied here.
