Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Body temperature rises as a result of exercise in a running               
              wheel during the active period of the daily cycle in female rats.              
              During their inactive period, in which they do not exercise, body              
              temperature is elevated above what it would have been if they had              
              no previous exercise bout. Dr. Satinoff will study the parameters              
              of this phenomenon of post-exercise elevated body temperature.                 
              Experiments will be aimed at determiming : 1. whether males                    
              display this phenomenon as well as females, 2. what duration of                
              exercise is critical and 3. what temporal characteristcs of the                
              exercise are important. This research will contribute to                       
              knowledge about how exercise affects body temperature regulation               
              in both immediate and longterm time frames.
