Abstract    :
              This ROW planning grant is concerned with developing a                         
              methodology for investigating the effects of help in plan                      
              selection for experienced programmers learning a new programing                
              language.  Programmers learning a new language spend the largest               
              percentage of their time in planning activities.  A model of                   
              program development in a new language shows that this activity                 
              causes much iteration in the developmental process.  This model                
              is contrasted with the model of programmers writing a program in               
              a known language.  This work will study object-oriented and                    
              declarative languages during the planning period.  After they                  
              type of planning help needed in different types of languages has               
              been determined plan templates will be constructed.  Studies                   
              willthen be designed to determine the effect that these templates              
              have on program development.
