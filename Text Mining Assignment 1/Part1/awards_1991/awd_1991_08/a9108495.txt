Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research planning project will develop a plan to study               
              the conditions under which women have been able to obtain positions            
              of leadership in labor unions.  The planning project will allow the            
              investigator to explore the feasibility of using a previously                  
              untapped source of data for this purpose, namely the LM-2 reports              
              filed with Department of Labor by American Unions each year since              
              1960.  She will begin the process of coding the data and converting            
              them into machine readable form and decide which unions to choose              
              for her sample.                                                                
                                                                                             
                   This project will result in a research proposal that will                 
              examine the historical conditions which account for why unions                 
              develop one or another strategy regarding the representation of                
              women in the union leadership.
