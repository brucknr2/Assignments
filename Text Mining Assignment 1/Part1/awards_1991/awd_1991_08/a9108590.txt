Abstract    :
                The Department of Physics at Southern University Baton Rouge                 
              (SUBR) proposes to carry out a comprehensive research and                      
              enrichment project for underrepresented and eligible minority                  
              physics undergraduates.  Referred to as the Timbuktu Academy,                  
              this project is named after the University of Timbuktu, a                      
              bastion of scholarship in the middle of this millennium.  The                  
              Timbuktu Academy  will enroll and support twenty (20) physics                  
              graduates, seventy per cent of whom  are expected to earn                      
              Ph.D. degrees in physics and related fields.  Research                         
              participation, enrichment activities, and a stimulating                        
              academic advisement are central activities of the Academy.                     
              The proposed activities are guided by basic  tents of                          
              cognitive science, the taxonomies of the cognitive and                         
              affective domains, and recommendations from several national                   
              reports.  About ten percent (10%) of African American scholars                 
              who earned Ph.D. degree in physics, in the last five years,                    
              are alumni of the SUBR Physics Department.  Recent                             
              enhancements of the Department's resources are added                           
              predictors of the expected success of the Academy.  Existing                   
              and future linkages and partnerships with federal, industrial,                 
              and academic laboratories are essential factors in support of                  
              the operation and expansion of this Academy for the                            
              development of research careers for minority Scholars (RCMS).
