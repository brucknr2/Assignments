Abstract    :
              One of the remaining gaps in the quantitative record of U.S.                   
              economic history is detailed information on the fiscal activities              
              of state and local governments.  Annual time-series data on federal            
              revenues and expenditures are available from 1789 on, but similar              
              information on state and local governments is sparse, particularly             
              before 1900.  This project will close the statistical gap by                   
              developing annual time series of revenues and expenditures for each            
              state, and decennial estimates for the revenues and expenditures               
              of local governments, supplemented by a separate series of large               
              cities.  These series will indicate overall levels of fiscal                   
              activity as well as the sources and uses of funds.  State                      
              documents, published and unpublished, will furnish the basis for               
              the complete state-level series.  Local government estimates are               
              based on a sampling procedure.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The results of this project will include an analysis of the fiscal             
              history of state and local government.  The data base created                  
              during the course of this project will be made publicly available              
              through the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social                
              Research.  This data base is invaluable because it will establish              
              for the first time a solid, quantitative basis for estimating the              
              overall share of government in the economy throughout U.S. history             
              and the role of government in the nation's development.
