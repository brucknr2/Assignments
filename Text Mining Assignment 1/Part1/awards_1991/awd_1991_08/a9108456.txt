Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to ascertain the influence of vacuum               
              ultraviolet radiation (1200A) on the epitaxial crystallization of              
              gallium arsenide (GaAs).  A definitive study is planned to                     
              quantitatively assess the epitaxial growth rate and the crystalline            
              quality of GaAs films synthesized under conditions such that the               
              flux of ultraviolet radiation is varied over four orders of                    
              magnitude while other growth parameters are held essentially                   
              constant.  The results of this study could have a significant                  
              impact on fundamental understanding of vapor phase epitaxy, and may            
              provide a means for lowering the temperature requirements of                   
              epitaxial crystallization of technologically important electronic              
              and photonic materials without compromising the exceedingly high               
              crystal quality needed for advanced electronic and photonic                    
              devices.
