Abstract    :
              Detecting the occurrence of an underlying change in a process, when            
              observations are only related probabilistically to the state of the            
              process, has long been a problem of concern to statisticians,                  
              engineers, economists, epidemiologists, etc.  In this proposal, we             
              use the context of machine monitoring, although applications to                
              areas such as quality control, health, military surveillance or                
              economic analysis should be readily appparent.  We propose to                  
              address four issues that are relatively neglected both in the                  
              literature and in practice:                                                    
              (1) Rather then focusing on the expected time until the first false            
              alarm is raised, given the system remains `in control', we propose             
              the use of the more practical concept of `false alarm rate', the               
              expected number of false alarms per unit time during the entire                
              monitoring process.                                                            
              (2) Rather than focusing on the expected time to detect the system             
              as out of control, given it is out of control, we focus on the                 
              expected time between when the system goes out of control and when             
              it is detected as out of control in the course of the monitoring               
              policy.                                                                        
              (3) We propose to investigate various exact and approximate ways               
              to compute system operating characteristics.                                   
              (4) We propose to examine the sensitivity of operating                         
              characteristics to changes in expected time between system failure,            
              relative discriminatory power of sampling devices and the existence            
              of natural times at which to monitor and take actions.
