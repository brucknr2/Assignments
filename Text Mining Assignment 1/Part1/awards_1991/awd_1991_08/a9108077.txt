Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is to support the travel cost of twenty American                   
              Scientists who will be attending the Twelfth Congress of the                   
              International Union of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences to               
              be held in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, September, 1991.  The                   
              meeting will allow American anthropologists the opportunity to                 
              interact with scientists in their fields from around the world.                
              It also allows the opportunity for scientists from different                   
              nations to initiate scientific collaborations on topics of common              
              interest.  The location of this meeting is important at this time              
              in history due to the numerous changes taking place in the                     
              eastern European countries.
