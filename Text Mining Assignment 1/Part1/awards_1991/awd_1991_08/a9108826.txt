Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This project will study the causes and consequences of dual-                   
              earner couples' decisions to share parenting equally.  The                     
              background characteristics of equally-sharing couples, the ways                
              in which they develop an equal division of childcare                           
              responsibilities, and the impact of this nontraditional division               
              of labor on wives, husbands, marriages, and children will be                   
              examined.  The project will entail three phases:  1) telephone                 
              interviews with husbands and wives in 400 couples, designed to                 
              identify a sample of equal-sharing couples and to illuminate the               
              factors that influence parents' assessments of the division of                 
              childcare; 2) of paternal participation, including 60 middle-                  
              class and working class couples who share parenting equally; 3) a              
              set of interviews with husbands and wives in 30 expectant couples              
              who intend to share parenting equally and follow-up interviews                 
              with husbands and wives in the original 60 equally sharing                     
              couples.  The research will inform our understanding of the                    
              development of identity in adulthood, the link between sex-role                
              ideology and family organization, the barriers that keep men from              
              full participation in the family, and the potential benefits that              
              fathers' full participation might bring.
