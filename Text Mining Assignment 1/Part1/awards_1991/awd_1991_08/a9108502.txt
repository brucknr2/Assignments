Abstract    :
              The development of cost-effective affinity separations                         
              will eventually require that expensive and labile                              
              biological affinity ligands be replaced by small chemical                      
              mimics.  The Principal Investigators (PIs) have begun to                       
              develop a very promising new class of synthetic materials                      
              that are highly selective for individual proteins.  These                      
              new affinity reagents are polymers which contain arrays of                     
              metal ions that bind complementary arrays of functional                        
              groups on the surface of target proteins.  The novel                           
              feature that determines the selectivity of recognition of                      
              protein separations is to match the spacing of metal ions                      
              (copper) in the polymer to the spacing of                                      
              metal-coordinating amino acid residues (histidine) on the                      
              protein surface.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to develop aqueous template                       
              polymerization monomers and techniques in order to prepare                     
              affinity polymers for protein separations and to identify                      
              the key physical and chemical properties that dictate the                      
              selectivity and strength of protein binding by the                             
              resulting materials.  Three types of materials will be                         
              investigated: i) macroporous polymers, ii) thin layers of                      
              polymers that are used to coat porous beads or other                           
              surfaces, and iii) lipid vesicles.  This research promises                     
              to yield a generic method for synthesizing stable and                          
              versatile selective polymers that are well-suited to                           
              cost-effective, large-scale protein purification.
