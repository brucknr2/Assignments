Abstract    :
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                     
              (EPSCoR) in the state of North Dakota will enhance the                         
              research competitiveness of approximately 20 faculty members                   
              working in three established research clusters located at                      
              the two major state universities, North Dakota State                           
              University (NDSU) and The University of North Dakota (UND).                    
              The research clusters selected for enhancement have the                        
              potential for national prominence and include: (1)                             
              Supramolecular Protein Complexes: Roles in Metabolic                           
              Regulation and Intracellular Structure (NDSU and UND); (2)                     
              Population Change and Genetic Diversity (NDSU and UND) and                     
              (3) Main Group Organometallic Chemistry (NDSU).  A fourth                      
              emerging research cluster in the area of intelligent systems                   
              will be supported entirely by state funds.  It will provide                    
              the state with a means to pursue its economic development                      
              strategy in advanced scientific computing.  In addition,                       
              outreach programs in education and human resource                              
              development will be conducted that build and strengthen                        
              partnerships between the two universities and the two- and                     
              four-year state colleges, Native American community                            
              colleges, the high schools and junior high schools in the                      
              state, and the general public.  The state of North Dakota                      
              and institutions will help build and maintain the science                      
              and engineering infrastructure through an outright                             
              contribution of $1.333 million per year in matching funds                      
              plus a full contribution of all indirect costs for a total                     
              contribution over three years of over $6.5 million.
