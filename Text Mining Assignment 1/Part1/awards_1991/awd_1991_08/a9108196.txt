Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports a cultural anthropologist in a research                  
              project in Sri Lanka.  The project will restudy a rural community              
              of pottery producers who have experienced significant economic                 
              growth and relative prosperity since the 1970s.  The project will              
              conduct ethnographic research in producer households and surveys               
              of local markets, with the goal of relating current economic                   
              activity to development policy of the past 20 years.                           
                                                                                             
              This project is important because Sri Lanka has undergone                      
              "structural adjustment" in response to pressures from                          
              international development lending agencies.  These policies have               
              been associated with reports of declining living standards of the              
              rural poor.  This study of a case of improving conditions of life              
              will provide ideas and descriptive examples to refine and improve              
              the theory of economic development under structural adjustment.
