Abstract    :
              Dr. Hill proposes to investigate the structure of messenger RNA                
              (mRNA) while it is bound to the ribosome.  Although significant                
              progress has been made in understanding the details of transfer RNA            
              (tRNA) interaction with the ribosome, the interaction of mRNA with             
              the ribosome remains obscure. Yet, to understand how mRNA interacts            
              with the ribosome, tRNA and other factors involved in translation              
              is critical.  In this proposal, Dr. Hill outlines methods by which             
              this interaction can be studies using short, complementary DNA                 
              oligomers.  The results should indicate where structural changes               
              occur in the mRNA upon binding to the ribosome.  The path of the               
              mRNA through the ribosome will be mapped.  In addition, a                      
              collaborative project in which short DNA oligomers are used to                 
              place undeca-gold clusters in ribosome crystals is outlined.//
