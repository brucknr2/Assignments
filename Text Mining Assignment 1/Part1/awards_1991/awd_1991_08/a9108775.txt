Abstract    :
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                     
              (EPSCoR) in the state of Puerto Rico will enhance the research                 
              competitiveness of approximately 70 faculty working in 7                       
              research clusters.  The selected research areas:  (1)                          
              Development of a Marine Biotechnology Center: Molecular                        
              Regulation of Biotic Interactions, Response, and Production;                   
              (2) Molecular Biology of Parasites Group; (3) Research in                      
              Cellular and Molecular Mechanism of Nervous System                             
              Regeneration Group; (4) Computational Mathematics Group; (5)                   
              Development of an Engineering Infrastructure Research Center;                  
              (6) Development of a Materials Research Center; and (7)                        
              Development of an Interdisciplinary Group of Research on Metal                 
              Clusters: Their Structure, Bonding, and Reactivity.  Each of                   
              the projects have identified short, intermediate, and long                     
              range goals (up to the year 2000) and devised strategies to:                   
              achieve national and international levels of excellence;                       
              strengthen human resources in S&E, including the development                   
              of two new Ph.D.s, and provide for the involvement of four-                    
              year institutions faculty and students in their research                       
              project; create advisory councils of distinguished researchers                 
              to guide project development; establish collaborative                          
              agreement with national and international groups and                           
              laboratories; and vigorously seek additional funds to build                    
              on the base provided by EPSCoR.  Collaborative agreements have                 
              been made with the Industry/University/Research Center                         
              (INDUNIV), the Corporation for the Technological Development                   
              of Tropical Resources (TROPICO), and the Puerto Rico                           
              Scientific Community Council (SCC) to promote and advocate for                 
              the strengthening of the S&E community and the development of                  
              R&D in the private and government sectors.  Institutional                      
              commitments to EPSCoR include, $4.5 million contributed by                     
              UPR from Commonwealth funds, a waiver of indirect cost                         
              amounting to $2.1 million; as well as commitments to                           
              incrementally hire 35 new tenure-track S&E researchers.  From                  
              the private sector $900,000 from TROPICO, and $45,00 from                      
              INDUNIV were secured to contribute to EPSCoR efforts.
