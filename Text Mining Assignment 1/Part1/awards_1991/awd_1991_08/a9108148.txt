Abstract    :
                     This project is concerned with research in algebra and                  
              number theory.  One of the principal investigators will work on                
              the computation of Galois groups and K-admissibility questions.                
              He also expects to work on some related questions concerning                   
              group characters.  The other principal investigator will work on               
              Lie algebras of prime characteristic.  In addition to sharpening               
              his results on realizations of generalized Witt and contact                    
              algebras, he plans to study other algebras of Cartan type.                     
              Structural questions are a second part of his program.                         
                      The research supported by this award spans a variety of                
              topics in algebra and number theory.  The results have                         
              implications for many different areas of mathematics and physics.
