Abstract    :
                   This grant supports improvements to and computerization of the            
              Cornell University ornithology collection.  Much of the importance             
              of the collection lies in its age and sources and, therefore, its              
              record of change in habitats, species distributions, particular                
              morphologies and so on since the middle 1800s as well as its                   
              voucher record of celebrated ornithological research (270 graduate             
              degrees since 1915).  The collection of 45,600 specimens (36,800               
              skins, 4,000 skeletons, 1500 alcoholics, 2000 egg sets, 1000                   
              mounts, 300 nests) is particularly strong in New York and North                
              American species, with one of the best samples of hybrid zones in              
              the Great Plains and Mexico.  Part of the collection will be                   
              rehoused in new cabinets to alleviate crowding and aid                         
              conservation;  the entire collection will be computerized using                
              MUSE, a collection database package developed at Cornell with NSF              
              support.  These improvements will save the collection from a nearly            
              orphaned status, and will make it much more accessible for research            
              and education in the history of ornithology and the biology of                 
              birds.
