Abstract    :
              This award supports a project in computational lexicography which              
              is an international collaborative effort of Vassar's Computers                 
              Science Department and the Groupe Representation et Traitement                 
              des Connaissances (GRTC) of the Centre National de la Recherche                
              Scientifique (CNRS) in Marseille, France.  The project involves                
              the construction of a large-scale lexical and textual database                 
              from machine readable materials in English and French, with the                
              goal of extracting information that can be used for automatic                  
              language processing tasks.  A number of machine-readable                       
              materials in English and French, including dictionaries in                     
              typesetter's format but also corpora and other linguistic data,                
              have been acquired by the project and installed at each site.                  
              Software tools are being developed to structure, access, and                   
              analyze these data.  The project involves the structuring of                   
              machine readable dictionaries and other linguistic data into a                 
              consistent lexical database, and the extraction of lexical                     
              knowledge from these data for use in natural language                          
              understanding and translation.
