Abstract    :
                   This planning grant is concerned with the development of                  
              culturally relevant mathematics and science curriculum for                     
              Native Americans.  The project involves two trips to gather                    
              information for the development of a full research proposal.                   
              The investigators are to take two Native American students to                  
              the University of Illinois to study techniques developed in                    
              the Calculus/Mathematica Project.  The ultimate goal of                        
              this project is the determination of methods for making                        
              educational software and, in general, the traditional                          
              mathematics and science curriculum more relevant for Native                    
              Americans.  This grant also funds travel by the principal                      
              investigators to the Mathematics and Educational Reform                        
              Workshop to be held at the University of  Arizona, March                       
              21-24, 1991.                                                                   
                   This project represents a significant step in terms of                    
              attracting and retaining Native Americans in the science and                   
              engineering pipeline.  Often Native American tribal customs                    
              prevent young children from learning mathematics and science                   
              in the traditional Western manner.  The focus of this project                  
              is to find methods for introducing cultural relevance into                     
              educational software for Native Americans. It is recognized                    
              that there is a vast variety of Native American tribes and                     
              customs.  This project focuses on the Lummi tribe with a view                  
              towards methods for extending the techniques for other                         
              tribes.
