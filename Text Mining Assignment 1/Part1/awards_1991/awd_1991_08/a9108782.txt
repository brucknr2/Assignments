Abstract    :
                                                                                              
               Large - Eddy Simulation (LES) has served as a powerful tool for              
              turbulence research over the last two decades.  Computers with                 
              ever increasing speed and memory have also now made it possible                
              to compute some turbulent flows using Direct Numerical Simulation              
              (DNS).  The research on LES of separated turbulent flows is                    
              proposed using parallel computing techniques.  The study will                  
              determine the turbulence statistics for these flows.  The                      
              proposed computation is very intensive in terms of memory and CPU              
              time and, therefore, implementation on a multi-processor computer              
              should lead to development of an efficient algorithm.  The study               
              will provide valuable experience and knowledge in the development              
              of numerical algorithms for LES of separated turbulent flows,                  
              which can then be effectively applied to even more intensive                   
              computations using DNS of similar flows.                                       
                                                                                             
              To approximate the spatial derivatives, a combination of fourth-               
              order finite-differences and spectral discretization will be                   
              used.  Time derivatives will be approximated by an implicit                    
              method.  The proposed methods will be implemented on CRAY-                     
              YMP8/864.
