Abstract    :
                   Professor Bellow and Jones will continue their study of                   
              almost everywhere convergence questions which arise in ergodic                 
              theory and more generally in analysis.  They will focus on a                   
              number of issues.  Central among them are Bourgain's entropy                   
              criterion and the strong sweeping out property.  They will also                
              study problems involving averaging over thin sets such as sets of              
              Banach density zero in the individual ergodic theorem, discrete                
              averages in the case of a one parameter flow, annuli in the case               
              of a two parameter flow, etc.  One project on which they plan to               
              spend some time involves almost everywhere convergence for                     
              integrable functions.  This is a difficult area but the principal              
              investigators hope to make some progress using Calderon-Zygmund                
              decompositions.                                                                
                        This project involves research in ergodic theory.                    
              Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average                   
              behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic               
              to be followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading                       
              "dynamics" can be placed the modern theory of how groups of                    
              abstract transformations act on smooth spaces.   In this way                   
              ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to                     
              classify flows on homogeneous spaces.
