Abstract    :
              The objectives of this conference are to bring together                        
              biochemical engineers and biological scientists from                           
              universities, government, and industry from all over the                       
              world to share and assess the most recent advances and                         
              future needs in research related to biochemical                                
              engineering and biotechnology.  The meeting structure and                      
              interdisciplinary nature of the conference allows                              
              significant interactions among the participating engineers                     
                                                                                             
              and scientists.  The theme of this conference is:                              
              Biochemical Engineering Fundamentals:  Cellular and                            
              Reactor Engineering.
