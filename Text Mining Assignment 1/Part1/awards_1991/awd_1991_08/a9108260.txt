Abstract    :
                   Professor Shapiro's group will complete the analysis of                   
              their 1987 experiment to measure the deflection of radio waves                 
              due to the gravitational effects of the Sun.  Using the                        
              technique of very-long-baseline interferometry, they observed                  
              two radio sources over a two-week interval centered on the                     
              annual passage of the Sun in front of one of the sources.  By                  
              fitting this data with a model that includes a free parameter                  
              scaling the effects predicted by general relativity, they will                 
              determine the gravitational deflection with a standard error                   
              of 0.1 percent of the magnitude predicted by general                           
              relativity.                                                                    
                   Improving the accuracy of one of the few observational                    
              tests of general relativity is important not only as a test of                 
              the currently accepted theory of gravity, but also due to the                  
              role of general relativistic gravitation in the understanding                  
              of cosmology, black holes, quasars, and other massive                          
              astronomical objects.  This "light"-deflection experiment is                   
              an advance over earlier ones since it uses signals recorded in                 
              three widely-separated radio-frequency bands (2, 8, and 23                     
              GHz), allowing for higher accuracy corrections for the                         
              observational errors contributed by the dispersion of radio                    
              waves in the ionosphere and the solar corona.
