Abstract    :
                   Much scientific research now involves obtaining large numbers             
              of observations which are interrelated in highly complicated ways.             
              Quantitative work for such research is often best served in a                  
              supercomputer environment because of both the enormity of the data             
              and the complexity of the relationships.  In this exploratory                  
              project the principal investigator will examine the statistical                
              interface with supercomputing to determine areas of statistical                
              theory and also applications where the comparative advantage of                
              supercomputing is great.  Then with a selected area or application             
              as the focus, essential statistical issues may be defined or                   
              redefined for the supercomputing context.
