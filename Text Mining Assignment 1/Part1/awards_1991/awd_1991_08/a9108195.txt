Abstract    :
                   The two principal investigators, Richard Durrett and Simon                
              Levin, bring to this Small Grants for Exploratory Research                     
              project expertise in stochastic processes (mathematics) and                    
              ecology (biology).  They will apply ideas from the theory of                   
              interacting particle systems to study the spread and persistence               
              of invading species and the role of dispersal in the dynamics of               
              populations and communities.  Concrete problems include (i) the                
              effect of environmental inhomogeneity on the spread of raccoon                 
              rabies (ii) epidemics in spatially distributed populations, and                
              (iii) a spatial version of Maynard Smith's evolutionary game.                  
              These applications will require the development of some new                    
              theory, e.g. methods for estimating critical values, since                     
              interacting particle systems have not yet been applied to real                 
              data.
