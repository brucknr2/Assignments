Abstract    :
              A program of study of the solid/solution interface will be                     
              performed involving the preparation of well defined colloidal                  
              dispersions, studies of chemical reactions in aerosols, and                    
              particle-particle interactions.  Special emphasis will be                      
              placed on the preparation and characterization of particles                    
              consisting of more than one cation.  The relationship of the                   
              composition of the solid phase to that of the solution will be                 
              examined.  Coated particles having different surfaces and cores                
              will be examined with a view to developing particles with                      
              surfaces containing high value components.    The interaction                  
              between particles of different composition, size and surface                   
              potential in media of varying ionic strength will be examined                  
              both experimentally and theoretically.                                         
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on the study of chemical reactions at                       
              solid/solution interfaces and in aerosols.  The project                        
              promises to extend our understanding of colloidal particles.                   
              The outcome of this research has considerable practical                        
              applications impacting on several important technologies (e.g.                 
              ceramics, paints, catalysis).
