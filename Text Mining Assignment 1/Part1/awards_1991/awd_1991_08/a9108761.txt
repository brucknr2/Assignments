Abstract    :
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive                              
              Research (EPSCoR) in the state of Alabama will enhance                         
              the research competitiveness of approximately 70                               
              investigators working in five research clusters:  (1)                          
              Coastal Marine Sciences; (2) Land-Water Interfaces; (3)                        
              Modification of Material Surfaces; (4) Tailored                                
              Interfaces in Composite Materials; and (5) Interactions                        
              Between Galaxies and Their Environments.  Six                                  
              universities will participate: Auburn University;                              
              Alabama A&M University; University of Alabama,                                 
              Birmingham; University of Alabama, Huntsville; and                             
              University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa.  The state's                                
              research base will be strengthened by adding tenure-                           
              track positions in materials science and biology;                              
              conducting an Agency Visitation Program will improve                           
              proposal success rates by providing faculty travel                             
              funds for visits to federal program officers; and                              
              implementing an Instrumentation Matching Grant fund.                           
              In addition, The Alabama Technology Transfer Council                           
              will be established to develop improved relationships                          
              with the private sector.  Active participants in EPSCoR                        
              governance will include key university administrators,                         
              state government officers, and influential members of                          
              the private sector.  Over the three-year award period                          
              the State of Alabama and institutions will contribute                          
              $19 million to ensure the success of the EPSCoR effort.
