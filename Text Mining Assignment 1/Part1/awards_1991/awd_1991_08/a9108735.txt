Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with research in commutative                    
              algebra.  The principal investigator will investigate the structure            
              of projective modules and the efficient generation of ideals and               
              modules over affine algebras.  The goal is to study these problems             
              by attaching suitable invariants to projective modules and ideals.             
              These invariants arise from the geometry of the affine variety                 
              attached to the ring.  A prominent role is played by the Chow                  
              groups of the affine varieties and the Chern classes of projective             
              modules.                                                                       
                   This research is in the general area of algebraic geometry.               
              Algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects arising from              
              the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial equations.  This is one             
              of the oldest and currently one of the most active branches of                 
              mathematics.  It has widespread applications in mathematics,                   
              computer science and physics.
