Abstract    :
              Michael Herman is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and                
              Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies                 
              on vibrational relaxation in liquids. He will apply                            
              path-integral Monte Carlo computer simulation techniques to the                
              calculation of the relaxation rate for vibrational populations                 
              of small molecules in simple solvents.  He will continue to                    
              refine the methodology for conditioning of the highly                          
              oscillatory integrands which occur in real time discretized                    
              path integrals.  In the initial phase of the project only low                  
              lying vibrational excitations of diatomics in simple solvents                  
              will be considered.  After sufficient numerical experience has                 
              been gained from these systems, he will consider systems with                  
              highly vibrationally excited diatomics and polyatomics for                     
              which the full path integral theory is required.

              Theoretical studies of vibrational relaxation in liquids is                    
              important in the field of chemistry because the rate at which                  
              molecules gain and lose vibrational energy influences their                    
              rates of chemical reaction, their energy transport properties                  
              and their experimentally observed spectra.
