Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Control theories and techniques have been                                      
              successfully applied in many areas such as                                     
              aerospace engineering, navigation, and                                         
              manufacturing.  However, only recently their                                   
              applications to civil engineering structures                                   
              such as buildings and bridges for their                                        
              safety and confort design in seismic or wind                                   
              conditions have been seriously pursued.  The                                   
              potential and future research needs for such                                   
              applications were the focal points of                                          
              discussion during a recent National Workshop                                   
              on Structural Control Research,  held at the                                   
              University of Southern California (USC) in                                     
              October, 1990.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              One essential component of the structural                                      
              control technology is that related to new                                      
              sensors, actuators, and signal processing                                      
              which was not covered during the USC                                           
              Workshop.  These aspects hold the key to the                                   
              successful implementation of structural                                        
              control from both technological and practical                                  
              considerations that represent a rapidly                                        
              evolving field of cross-disciplinary nature.                                   
              This Workshop will bring together a number of                                  
              key academic and industry researchers active                                   
              in structural control and behavior, sensors                                    
              and actuator technology, and signal                                            
              processing to identify those research                                          
              directions which offer the greatest potential                                  
              impact on structural performance.                                              
                                                                                             
              This effort will provide a critical component                                  
              of the technical basis required for the                                        
              development and implementation of control                                      
              technology in providing the design safety of                                   
              new structures.  It will also provide                                          
              valuable insights on the potential use of                                      
              control technology in the upgrading and                                        
              rehabilitation of vulnerable existing                                          
              structures which are exposed to the threat of                                  
              natural hazards.
