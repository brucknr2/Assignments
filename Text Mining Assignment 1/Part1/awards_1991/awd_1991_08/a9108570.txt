Abstract    :
              Femtosecond lasers and optical techniques have been                            
              used with great success to study a variety of ultrafast                        
              processes in optical materials.  Most of these                                 
              experiments are, however, performed with the                                   
              Rhodamine 6G dye laser around 630 nm in the                                    
              visible.  There is a clear need to extend the                                  
              femtosecond sources to the uv and to the ir and to                             
              achieve wide tunability.                                                       
                                                                                             
              We have recently succeeded in demonstrating for the                            
              first time a cw uv femtosecond source at 315 nm and                            
              the first broadly tunable femtosecond optical                                  
              parametric oscillator (OPO) in the deep red to near                            
              ir.  The OPO is potentially continuously tunable from                          
              720 nm to 4.5 uM.  Although our initial experiments                            
              have demonstrated the spectacular potentials of these                          
              devices, much work remains to realize these                                    
              potentials.  A program of research to develop,                                 
              characterize, and optimize femtosescond sources in                             
              the uv and broadly tunable optical parametric                                  
              oscillators in the ir pumped by solid state laser                              
              sources is outlined.  In addition, we propose to apply                         
              these unique sources to study the relaxation dynamics                          
              of nonequilibrium electrons and holes in GaAs and                              
              related compounds and quantum well structures.
