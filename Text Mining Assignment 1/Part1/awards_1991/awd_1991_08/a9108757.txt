Abstract    :
              This project investigates the evolutionary relationships among                 
              three groups of free-living flatworms.  A highly conserved gene of             
              the mitochondrial DNA will be amplified using a new technique                  
              called the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR.  Once amplified, the             
              gene will be sequenced.  The amplified products will also be used              
              to clone larger pieces of the mitochondrial DNA with which the                 
              order of other mitochondrial genes can be determined.                          
              Mitochondrial DNA gene order will be used to determine evolutionary            
              relationships among the three groups of flatworms.  This                       
              information will be a beginning for a long-term study on                       
              mitochondrial gene order and gene sequences of nuclear DNA of                  
              representatives of an entire family of flatworms.                              
                                                                                             
              Many flatworms hold a key position in theories on the origin of                
              multicellular animals.  Therefore, a better understanding of                   
              relationships among flatworms will also have implications for a                
              better understanding of the evolution of multicellular animals.
