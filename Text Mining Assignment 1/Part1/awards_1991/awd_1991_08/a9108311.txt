Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics and astrophysics will                     
              concentrate on studies of cosmic topological defects and                       
              quantum cosmology.  The topological defects can include                        
              strings, domain walls, and other structures which can help                     
              solve the riddle of how "lumps" such as galaxies formed out of                 
              a very smooth early universe.  Quantum cosmology is an effort                  
              to understand the nature of the big bang, and in particular                    
              the very first instant of the universe.
