Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to produce an extensive grammar of                 
              West-Greenlandic Eskimo. The grammar will contain technical and                
              non-technical descriptions to suit the needs of both linguists and             
              Native speakers. This research will serve as a basis for the                   
              production of manuals for related languages in Greenland, Canada,              
              Alaska and Siberia and contribute to the preservation and                      
              revitalization of Native languages and cultures throughout the                 
              Arctic.
