Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Trade Unions and employers' associations vary widely in their                  
              degree of centralization across the advanced industrial                        
              democracies.  The sources and economic consequences of the extent              
              of centralization of such associations have been subjects of                   
              considerable debate.  While it is clear that the extent of                     
              centralization has substantial consequences in terms of economic               
              policies and outcomes, the specific nature of these relationships              
              is not well understood.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This collaborative research explores both the causes and                       
              consequences of union centralization in advanced industrial                    
              societies.  Government data and interviews with local experts will             
              be used to construct a comprehensive data set on the centralization            
              of national industrial relations systems and of trade unions and               
              employers' associations in approximately 20 european nations over              
              an extended time period.  These data will permit a much more                   
              systematic and thorough exploration of the causes and consequences             
              of union centralization.                                                       
                                                                                             
              When completed this project will provide the basis for a better                
              understanding of union, management, government relations and how               
              they can be improved.
