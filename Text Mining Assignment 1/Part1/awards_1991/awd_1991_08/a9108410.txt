Abstract    :
              This proposal will (1) investigate the applicability of the wavelet            
              transform, in particular, a recently developed decomposition                   
              procedure based on a stochastic wavelet transform and a spectral               
              factorization theorem, in the design of efficient and high quality             
              data compression algorithms for use with wide-sense stationary                 
              random processes; and (2) to develop a non-stationary theory for               
              the wavelet transform, and apply this to efficiently encode non-               
              stationary random processes including transient pulse processes,               
              cyclostationary processes, and asymptotic mean stationary                      
              processes.
