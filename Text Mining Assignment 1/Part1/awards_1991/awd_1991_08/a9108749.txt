Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with research in algebraic                      
              combinatorics and combinatorics motivated by theoretical computer              
              science.  The principal investigator will consider problems                    
              pertaining to an algebraic and topological investigation of                    
              partially ordered sets of combinatorial objects, sorting of                    
              partially ordered sets, and graph coloring in connection with                  
              distributed computing.                                                         
                   This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,               
              which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                 
              Combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of all            
              mathematical activities, counting.  In its modern development,                 
              however, combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of            
              a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques.  The field has             
              had an explosive development in the past few decades because of its            
              importance in communications and information technology.
