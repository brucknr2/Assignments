Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will develop                      
              theoretical methods for describing potential step and scanned                  
              potential electrochemical methods.  Integral equation                          
              methodology is employed to describe the current at                             
              ultramicroelectrode arrays as a function of time.                              
              Collaboration between Cope (applied mathematics) and Tallman                   
              (chemistry) results in modern numerical methods for describing                 
              short time (and thus rapid) electrochemical processes.                         
              Diffusion to various shaped electrodes will be explored.

              Ultramicroelectrodes can probe tiny volumes for oxidizable or                  
              reducable species, and are used to study neurochemistry and                    
              other microscopic environments.  Cope and Tallman are studying                 
              the theory of electrochemical measurements at such electrodes.                 
              Understanding of the temporal evolution of current at                          
              microelectrodes allows one to separate that part of the current                
              due to mass transport (diffusion) and that due to reaction                     
              kinetics.  The latter, in turn, can reveal chemical dynamics                   
              information unique to particular species.
