               CICNet, a midlevel network supplying high level connectivity                 
              to the universities of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation              
              (CIC) (which includes the universities of Ohio State, Michigan                 
              State, University of Michigan, Indiana University, University of               
              Chicago, Purdue University, University of Illinois, Northwestern               
              University, Universtiy of Wisconsin, University of Minnesota, and              
              University of Iowa) and establishing cooperative working                       
              agreements with intrastate networks in its region, will be                     
              provided funding to support the continued operation of the CICNet              
              data network.                                                                  
                                                                                             
                The primary focus of this project is to improve the                          
              technological and operational aspects of CICNet and extend and                 
              expand the value of CICNet and of the many resources to which it               
              provides access.                                                               
                                                                                             
                The initial award to the University of Illinois for the start                
              of CICNet has provided two years of operation during which time                
              CICNet has provided high bandwidth connectivity (1.544 milliion                
              bits per second) for the midlevel region from Ohio to Minnesota                
              to the NSFNET Nationwide Backbone Network.  This renewal outlines              
              the continuation of the operation of this                                      
              network as well as the expansion of network information services               
              with a special emphasis on end-user orientation.***//
