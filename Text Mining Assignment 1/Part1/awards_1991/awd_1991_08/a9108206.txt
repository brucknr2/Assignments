Abstract    :
              The effects of surface basicity and microporosity of the                       
              support on the conversion of n-hexane over platinum on                         
              magnesia catalysts is examined.  Platinum clusters inside the                  
              channels of basic zeolites catalyze the aromatization of n-                    
              hexane with high activity and selectivity; recently it has                     
              been discovered that platinum clusters on a nonzeolitic basic                  
              oxide possess similar activity and selectivity, throwing into                  
              question the usual explanations for this property.  In this                    
              study, the composition of the oxide is varied systematically                   
              to change both the microporosity and the surface basicity in                   
              predictable and measurable ways.  Reactivity measurements are                  
              used to determine the importance of these structural and                       
              chemical variables on the selectivity of platinum-catalyzed                    
              aromatization.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This work attempts to redefine the factors responsible for the                 
              high selectivity observed.  It is already clear that this                      
              approach should have a broader scope than thought previously,                  
              but the limits of the scope are unknown.  Applications in                      
              processing of chemicals and fuels are numerous.
