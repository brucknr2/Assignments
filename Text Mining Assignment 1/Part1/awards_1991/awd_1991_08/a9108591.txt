Abstract    :
              This award, made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                            
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, deals with transition metal                  
              complexes of carbon dioxide and offers the prospect of CO2                     
              reduction to methanol or formaldehyde. Heterobimetallic                        
              carboxylates will be prepared either by reaction of                            
              nucleophilic metal carboxylates with metallo-Lewis acids or by                 
              CO2 insertion into metal-metal bonds. In either case, the                      
              metals chosen will have a "push-pull" effect which will                        
              stabilize the bound CO2. The metal pairs selected will                         
              generally be an electron rich transition metal (Fe, Ru) and an                 
              oxophilic early-metal (Zr,Hf,W). Supporting ligands on the                     
              metal pairs will  be selected to optimize CO2 insertion and                    
              stabilize  the bridged heterobimetallic complexes. Structures                  
              and reactivities of the CO2 complexes and their intermediates                  
              will be determined along the synthetic route. Reduction of                     
              bound CO2 will be effected by means of zirconium or silicon                    
              hydrides.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              Transition metal-CO2 chemistry is an important research area                   
              which is relevant to fundamental processes such as                             
              photosynthesis. It also serves as a model for important,                       
              commercial, heterogeneously-catalyzed processes such as                        
              methanol and formaldehyde synthesis.
