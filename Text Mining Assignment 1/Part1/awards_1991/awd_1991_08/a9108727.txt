Abstract    :
              This award is for a planning grant funded under the Minority                   
              Research Initiation Program.  The purpose of a planning grant is               
              to provide financial support for an investigator  to prepare a                 
              competitive research proposal.  This planning grant will enable the            
              investigator to prepare a research proposal which focuses on                   
              analyzing the consumer behavior of low income people.                          
                                                                                             
              Like all consumers, the behavior of low income people is motivated             
              by economic, sociological, and psychological factors.  However,                
              often those responsible for helping poor people improve their                  
              consumer skills through education intervention feel that low income            
              people are irresponsible and irrational when it comes to making                
              choices.  This proposed research will examine the consumer behavior            
              of poor people and seek to determine whether or not economic theory            
              provides a structure for understanding and evaluating the consumer             
              behavior of this income class.
