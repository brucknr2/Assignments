Abstract    :
              This is a Cooperative Agreement between the National                           
              Science Foundation's Office of Experimental Programs to                        
              Stimulate Competitive Research and Technomics                                  
              International, Inc. of Dublin, Ireland.  The purpose of                        
              this agreement is to have Dr. Thomas Higgins, Director                         
              of Technomics International, site visit fourteen EPSCoR                        
              States before June 15, 1991 to evaluate opportunities for                      
              EPSCoR/EEC scientific and engineering cooperation,                             
              commonalities of interests, methods of "mapping"                               
              state/country scientific strengths/weaknesses, and                             
              methods of evaluation.  The agreement provides for a                           
              minimum of four international trips to complete the site                       
              visits and present the "findings" at the EPSCoR annual                         
              conference.  Seven copies of the final report are                              
              required.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Dr. Higgins' report will provide specific actions to be                        
              undertaken to enhance EPSCoR/EEC collaboration and                             
              cooperation.  Based upon the proposal and excellent                            
              reviews, this cooperative agreement for $50,000 is                             
              recommended.
