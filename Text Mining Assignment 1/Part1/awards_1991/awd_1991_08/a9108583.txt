Abstract    :
              The ability to recover and purify natural and recombinant                      
              proteins, and the costs of doing so, remain a major task                       
              in introducing potential products for biotechnology.  The                      
              available bases for separation range from specific binding                     
                                                                                             
              onto tailored reagents to solubility and partitioning                          
              behavior governed by a mixed bag of size, charge and                           
              hydrophobicity.  The separation methods considered here                        
              are precipitation, and ion-exchange using both resins and                      
              membranes.  Improvements in selectivity are sought by                          
              bestowing a distinctive charge on the protein of interest                      
              such that a charge-based separation method provides                            
              selective recovery.  The charge is provided using a                            
              polypeptide "purification" fusion tail introduced by                           
              placing a synthetic oligonucleotide at the end of the gene                     
                                                                                             
              for the protein.  The series of fusion proteins provides a                     
                                                                                             
              means of studying the charge-dependent phenomena in                            
              separation methods which may be dependent on several                           
              characteristics of the protein.
