Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research focuses on the examination of the properties of                  
              condensed phases and clusters by computer simulation.  It will                 
              concentrate on the electronic degrees of freedom within these                  
              systems and the algorithms necessary to simulate them.                         
              Particular emphasis will be placed on going beyond Density                     
              Functional Theory which gives only approximate ground state                    
              properties and the parallelization of the various algorithms used              
              to study many fermions.  The ultimate goal of this program is the              
              microscopic modeling of real chemical processes at surfaces and                
              in the bulk in a computationally efficient manner.
