Abstract    :
              A Research Initiation Award will support a study of the                        
              electrochemical synthesis of metal-matrix composites.  Emphasis                
              will be on room temperature process conditions which result in                 
              fully dense, near-net and complex-shaped monolithic and fiber                  
              reinforced composites.  An analytical model will be developed and              
              validated by experimental observation of structure-property-                   
              processing interrelationships.
