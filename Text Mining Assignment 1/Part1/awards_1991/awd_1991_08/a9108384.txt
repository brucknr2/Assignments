Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University                 
              purchase laser equipment.  This equipment will be used in the                  
              following research activities:                                                 
                                                                                             
              1)  Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) for                         
                  picosecond fluorescence lifetime measurements.                             
                                                                                             
              2)  Picosecond and femtosecond UV/Visible transient                            
                  absorption measurements.                                                   
                                                                                             
              3)  Picosecond transient resonance Raman measurements and                      
                  picosecond transient IR absorption measurements.                           
                                                                                             
              4)  Nonlinear optical (NLO) characterization of materials                      
                  using degenerate four wave mixing (DFWM) and the optical                   
                  Kerr effect (OKE).                                                         
                                                                                             
              Lasers emit a narow beam of coherent, powerful and nearly                      
              monochromatic electromagnetic radiation.  This radiation is                    
              used in Chemistry to study a broad range of subjects, from the                 
              dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids to photoelectron                        
              transfer processes, and from interfacial chemistry to                          
              picosecond pulse shaping.  Lasers are also useful in optics,                   
              communications, and engineering.
