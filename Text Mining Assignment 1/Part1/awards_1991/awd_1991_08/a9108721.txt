Abstract    :
              Governments frequently target macroeconomic variables such as                  
              exchange rates and interest rates through a mixed policy of                    
              occasional interventions affecting floating rates.  Under the                  
              recent managed float, for example, monetary authorities allow                  
              exchange rates to be determined by market forces most the time,                
              only to intervene as rates deviate significantly from target                   
              levels.  Accordingly, it has been frequently reported in the                   
              financial press that occasional government intervention appears to             
              influence expectations on the part of private market traders who               
              face possible capital gains and loses from these events.  If this              
              is the case, asset prices should reflect expected interventions to             
              target rates.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to develop a model for analyzing                
              the effects of government interventions that prevent movements in              
              interest and exchange rates from targeted levels.  The analysis                
              will show how the perceived threat of occasional capital gains or              
              losses induced by central bank interventions may influence market              
              trading.  The model will also be used to empirically evaluate the              
              behavior of exchange rates when intervention policies are used to              
              target rates.  This research is important because it will help us              
              better understand how policies of targeting exchange rates affect              
              the market's perception of these policies and how these                        
              perceptions, in turn, affect rates.
