Abstract    :
                   This research project in nuclear theory will develop the                  
              quasi-particle RPA technique to study the usefulness of 127 I                  
              as a solar neutrino detector and for improved calculations of                  
              r-process nucleosynthesis.  Other topics include using mapping                 
              techniques for multi-quark Hamiltonians, modeling cosmic ray                   
              cascades, exacting the n-p monopole interaction from data and                  
              shell model calculations in deformed nuclei using Nilsson-                     
              based truncations.
