Abstract    :
                   Walter Neumann will continue his study (previously                        
              supported by DMS-8805551) of the topology of complex curves and                
              surfaces and their singularities and of the geometry and                       
              arithmetic of low-dimensional manifolds.                                       
                   Alan Reid will study arithmetic and geometric aspects of                  
              hyperbolic 3-manifolds, with special emphasis on questions of                  
              existence of incompressible surfaces, isospectrality, special                  
              arithmetic and geometric properties of knot complements, and the               
              Lehmer conjecture.                                                             
                   Low-dimensional manifolds are very natural geometric objects              
              and deserve to be thoroughly understood.  The physical world is a              
              3-dimensional or 4-dimensional manifold, depending upon whether                
              one includes the time dimension.  Hyperbolic metrics are in some               
              ways more natural than Euclidean metrics, even through locally                 
              our world appears to be Euclidean.
