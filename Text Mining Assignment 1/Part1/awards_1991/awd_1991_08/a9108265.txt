Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research examines the corrosion behavior of amorphous metals.             
              The focus is on transition metal/metalloid alloys and the                      
              mechanisms of formation of stable, protective, passive oxide films             
              on the surface of the alloys.  Several experimental techniques are             
              used to characterize the films and study their stability in various            
              environments.  The application of photoelectron spectroscopy in                
              conjunction with photoelectrochemical and standard electrochemical             
              techniques aids in clarifying the role of alloying elements in the             
              formation of the passive films.  A fundamental understanding of                
              passive film breakdown should result from the research.

              This research should lead to the development of new experimental               
              techniques, improvement in the understanding of passive films on               
              metal alloys, and improved chemistry to enhance the corrosion                  
              resistance of transition metal/metalloid magnetic materials.
