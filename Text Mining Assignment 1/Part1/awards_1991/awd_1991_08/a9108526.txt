Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Estuarine systems strongly influence biogeochemical cycles                     
              within ocean margins.  Research on the importance of estuaries                 
              in ocean margin biogeochemical cycles has been an important                    
              part of the studies funded or planned by federal agencies such                 
              as NOAA, NSF, and DOE in recent years.  The International                      
              Symposium on the Biogeochemistry of Model Estuaries was                        
              organized as an international effort to convene the best                       
              scientists working on estuarine chemical processes.  The first                 
              symposium was convened in Yugoslavia in May 1989, and a second                 
              conference will be held in Jekyll Island, Georgia 14-20 April                  
              1991.  This proposal is a request for modest funds to help                     
              finance the symposium, particularly junior scientists, and                     
              other domestic scientists outside the field.  Topic to be                      
              considered at the second symposium include:                                    
                                                                                             
                   - Effects of global change on estuarine processes                         
                   - Role of estuaries in global change                                      
                   - Estuarine topological schemes                                           
                   - Estuaries as sinks for materials from oceanic sources                   
                   - Importance of episodic events on estuarine processes                    
                   - Particle-water interactions in estuaries
