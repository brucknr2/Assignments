Abstract    :
                   Operational weather forecast models show little skill at                  
              predicting regime transitions such as the onset or dissipation of              
              "blocking events" (when large scale weather patterns remain locked             
              in large amplitude waves) even a day or two in advance.  Moreover,             
              this deficiency accounts for much of the loss of skill in dynamical            
              forecasts in the 30-day range.  Dr. Mak and colleagues will                    
              investigate the role and evolution of heat sources (radiation,                 
              condensation, and surface heating and cooling) in blocking events              
              as well as how high frequency disturbances (storms) affect vertical            
              circulation patterns in the troposphere on the intraseasonal scale.            
              They hope to clarify the quantitative contributions of these                   
              processes, and to delineate their relative importance in regime                
              transitions.  The dramatic blocking event of the winter of 1985-86             
              (which caused a record cold February in Europe) will be the focus              
              of the diagnostic studies.                                                     
                   The results obtained in this project should serve as an                   
              important contribution to community efforts to improve the skill of            
              extended-range forecasts.
