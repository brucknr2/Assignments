Abstract    :
                   Fundamental problems in distributed and parallel computation will         
              be investigated from both a theoretical and practical standpoint.  A           
              focal point of the research will be the study of the sequence                  
              transmission problem.  The sequence transmission problem is the                
              problem of transmitting an arbitrarily long sequence of messages from          
              one party to another over a channel which both reorder and lose                
              packets.  This problem is an abstraction of the classic problem of             
              designing an end-to-end transport layer protocol in the OSI model of a         
              computer network.  There is a series of new theoretical results, both          
              upper and lower bounds, which raise the possibility of a new class of          
              efficient protocols for this problem.  This project will investigate           
              this new class of protocols by analytically and experimentally                 
              exploring which variations have the best chance of practical                   
              implementations.  Those with the most promise will be implemented              
              under Unix using IP in a controlled experimental environment.                  
              Experiments will be undertaken on the INTERNET, but only after the             
              protocols have been thoroughly verified.  In addition to the sequence          
              transmission problem, several other distributed and parallel computing         
              problems will be studied.
