Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Curtis                
              Monnig's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support                 
              of his research at the University of California at Riverside.                  
              The main thrust of Dr. Monnig's research is the the development                
              of analytical techniques and instrumentation for quantitative                  
              analysis of bioactive molecules in small quantities, e.g., in                  
              individual cells.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Capillary electrophoresis and microcapillary liquid                            
              chromatography will be coupled with high sensitivity detectors                 
              (laser-induced fluorescence, mass spectrometry) to obtain                      
              qualitative and quantitative information about the chemical                    
              constituents of these samples.  This instrumentation will be                   
              used to identify and map chemical changes in developing cell                   
              populations.  The resulting cytochemical maps will be used to                  
              catalog the steps of chemical differentiation at the earliest                  
              stages of cell development and to identify suspected                           
              morphogenic substances.
