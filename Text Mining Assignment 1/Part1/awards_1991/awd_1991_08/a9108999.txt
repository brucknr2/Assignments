Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              Southern California acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer which                   
              will be used in research investigations in the following areas                 
              of chemistry:  1) High Field NMR Studies of Carbocations and                   
              Related Reactive Intermediates, 2) Reactions of Hydrocarbons in                
              the Coordination Sphere of Soluble Metal Complexes, 3) New                     
              Materials for the Study of Novel Optical, Electrical, and                      
              Magnetic Properties, 4) Synthetic Organic, Bioorganic, and                     
              Organometallic Chemistry, 5) Synthetic Applications of Anionic                 
              Vinyl Polymerization, 6) Studies in the Synthesis of                           
              Silicon-Containing Polymers.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
