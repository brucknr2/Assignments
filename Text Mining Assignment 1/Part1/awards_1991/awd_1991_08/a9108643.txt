Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project tracks income differences in men aged 50  through            
              80, comparing predictions about the amount of income inequality                
              derived from three theoretical perspectives.  These predict,                   
              respectively, that inequality will increase, decrease, or remain               
              constant during the retirement years.  Results will improve                    
              sociological understanding of stratification and aging, and have               
              implications for various programs such as Social Security, which               
              aim at affecting the distribution of income in later years.
