Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the application of microscopic, many-                 
              body calculations to a variety of physical problems including                  
              state-dependent nuclear interactions, 3He - 4He mixtures,                      
              finite temperature variational theory, helium films on                         
              structure functions of surfaces and droplets.
