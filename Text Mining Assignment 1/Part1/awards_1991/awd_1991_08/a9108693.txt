Abstract    :
                   The object of this work is to organize and hold a workshop                
              on the topic of cumulus convection, particularly its mathematical              
              and physical formulation, an urgent issue in current                           
              meteorological theory.  Approximately 30 participants have been                
              identified to discuss the topic, which should ensure a                         
              comprehensive treatment.
