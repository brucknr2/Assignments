Abstract    :
              This award will support a long-term research visit by                          
              Professor Anca Ralescu, Department of Computer Science,                        
              University of Cincinnati to the laboratory of Professor                        
              Michio Sugeno, Department of Systems Science of the Tokyo                      
              Institute of Technology, Nagatsuta, Japan. They will jointly                   
              carry out research on three important issues in the field of                   
              fuzzy logic: (1) fuzzy logic based concept learning from                       
              examples and counter examples (2) fuzzy syllogistic reasoning                  
              and its relation to other forms of inference under uncertain,                  
              incomplete, or not totally reliable data  (3) integrating                      
              quantitative semantics for knowledge representation as                         
              proposed by fuzzy logic and symbolic knowledge representation                  
              paradigm  with enhanced expressive power.                                      
                                                                                             
              The project represents an excellent collaboration between the                  
              Japanese and U.S. scientists.  Professor Ralescu has expertise                 
              in the management of uncertainty in expert systems.  Professor                 
              Sugeno is a well-known and established academic who was a                      
              pioneer in the area of "fuzzy" methods. Currently Japan is at                  
              the forefront in fuzzy theory research and                                     
              implementation.  At the same time research in the United                       
              States involving fuzzy logic is minimal.  Results of the                       
              research could contribute to the spread of fuzzy logic based                   
              devices into the engineering environment by making it                          
              possible to build fuzzy logic devices with limited intel-                      
              ligence.  It may also lead to a large number of commercial                     
              uses for fuzzy logic in the United States.
