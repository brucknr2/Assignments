Abstract    :
                   A State Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                
                                                                                            
              Nonwovens will be established at North Carolina State University.              
                                                                                             
              Nonwovens are a class of fabrics which are bonded fiber webs and               
                                                                                             
              which are not woven, knitted or paper structures.  This new                    
              industry has spawned new consumer, health care and industrial                  
              products.  The value of nonwoven goods exceeds $2.4 B annually.                
                                                                                             
              The base for this Center is an existing Industrial Consortium for              
                                                                                             
              Nonwovens Research.  This Center will serve the nonwovens industry             
                                                                                             
              in the State of North Carolina (about 100 small, medium, and large             
                                                                                             
              companies) and the U.S. through its programs of generic fundamental            
                                                                                             
              and applied research in the technologies of the industry, as well              
                                                                                             
              as through an active program of technology transfer.  The Center               
                                                                                             
              will be supported by funds from NSF, the State of North Carolina,              
                                                                                             
              and from the dues paid by member companies.                                    
                   The Center will be housed in the College of Textiles.  Its                
              faculty will be drawn, primarily, from the departments of the                  
              College, although members from other departments of the university             
                                                                                             
              (e.g., wood and paper science, mechanical engineering, computer                
              science, etc.) will also play a role as the Center grows in its                
              activities.  The structure of the Center includes an Industrial                
              Advisory Board and special activities to promote technology                    
              transfer to this industry.  The State of North Carolina, industry
