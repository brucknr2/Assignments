Abstract    :
                   Professor Cowen will study the structure of bounded linear                
              operator on the Hardy space, the Bergman space, and related spaces             
              of analytic functions on the unit disk.  He will continue his                  
              investigations of composition operators, Toeplitz operators, and               
              related operators.  His investigations will be carried out with                
              particular emphasis on providing research projects for both                    
              graduate and undergraduate students.                                           
                   Professor Cowen's research involves the theory of Hilbert                 
              space operators.  These objects can be thought of as infinite                  
              matrices of complex numbers.  They occur in almost all branches of             
              pure and applied mathematics.  The research being done here is an              
              attempt to understand and classify certain families of these                   
              operators.
