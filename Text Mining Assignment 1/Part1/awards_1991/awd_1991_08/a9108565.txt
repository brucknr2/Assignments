Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project will concentrate on continuing the Nitrogen              
              additions in both the hardwood and red pine stands, and measuring              
              basic N cycling parameters such as mineralization, nitrification,              
              and plant uptake, including green foliar content.  The project                 
              will also estimate N return to the system in litter fall and                   
              litter decay.  As well, trace gas fluxes (CO2, N2O, CH4) will be               
              measured.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              It is hypothesized that trace gas fluxes are controlled to a                   
              significant degree by short-term availability of carbon and                    
              nitrogen to soil microbes, and that these availabilities are, in               
              turn, constrained by feedbacks between soil availability and                   
              plant demand.  The effects of N additions on gross and net N                   
              immobilization and mineralization, on the production and                       
              consumption of available carbon during litter and soil organic                 
              matter decay, and on the available carbon and inorganic nitrogen               
              content of throughfall will be investigated.
