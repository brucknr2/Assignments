Abstract    :
              This project will develop an integrated confocal light microscope              
              and electrophysiology facility for observing living astroglia and              
              neurons in cell culture, and neurons in tissue, providing the                  
              simultaneous recording of three-dimensional images and                         
              physiologic responses for different biochemical and physiologic                
              stimuli.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Two glial cell projects utilize a well characterized model system              
              to study biochemical and morphologic changes due to receptor                   
              stimulation, mechanical stress, and ion uptake.  The neuron                    
              studies utilize isolated ganglia from Aplysia and hippocampal                  
              slices.  In Aplysia voltage-clamp measurements will be correlated              
              with three-dimensional morphology for variations in media                      
              osmolarity, ionic strength, and composition.  We have                          
              demonstrated volume changes under these conditions.  Local                     
              circuits and cell-to-cell communication will be studied in                     
              hippocampal slices.  All of the projects utilize confocal light                
              microscopy, and when appropriate high-voltage electron                         
              microscopy.
