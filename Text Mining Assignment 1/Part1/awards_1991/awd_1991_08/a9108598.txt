Abstract    :
              Lateral confinement of concrete by means of spirally winding a                 
              pretensioned tape of epoxy-impregnated high-strength aramid fiber              
              onto the concrete surface increase the compressive strength of                 
              concrete,  increases the maximum attainable strain (ductility),                
              provide a mechanims for shear resistance, and inhibits longitudinal            
              reinforcement buckling. The primary advantages of fiber-made tapes             
              as compared to steel strands or rods are: higher contact area and              
              low profile, no corrosion, possibility of pretensioning even with              
              prismatic cross sections, and automatic installation.  In this                 
              project, an extensive experimental and analytical study of this                
              strengthening/repair technology is conducted using 1/4 scale                   
              specimens with different cross sections and longitudinal/transverse            
              steel reinforcement characteristics, and subjected to combined                 
              cyclic loads (axial, shear, and bending).  The reinforcing tape                
              consists of a flattened tube made of braided aramid (Kevlar) fiber             
              with different areas, spiral pitches, and levels of prestress being            
              investigated.  A winding machine previously constructed by Mitsui              
              Construction Co. with the participation of this PI, is used for the            
              proposed research with the objective of continuing and improving               
              international scientific cooperation on the use of new construction            
              materials.
