Abstract    :
                   All plants exist in a competitive matrix, with strong and                 
              weak interactions among their neighbors.  A simplistic view of                 
              plant competition is that the larger a plant is, the more                      
              competitively effective it is.  However, grassland communities                 
              indicate that this is not necessarily the case.  Grasslands                    
              evolved in the presence of drought, fire and grazing.  All of                  
              these external factors influence plant size, growth rate, and                  
              physiological activity.  The P.I. will examine the effects of                  
              herbivory on the competitive interactions among grasses in two                 
              different grassland types.  Species in the tallgrass prairie of                
              central North America have not been found to compensate for                    
              herbivory (sensu Brown and Allen 1989) while species in the                    
              montane grasslands of Yellowstone National Park have been found                
              to do so.  Plants which respond negatively to herbivory should be              
              at a competitive disadvantage while those which respond                        
              positively should be competitively superior.  Testing this                     
              hypothesis will require a combination of field and modeling work.              
              Community patches will be subject to different levels of                       
              simulated herbivory in the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge of                
              Oklahoma and Yellowstone National Park.  Competition for a                     
              specific resource will be monitored by following uptake of stable              
              nitrogen isotopes between pairs of clipped/unclipped plants.                   
              Several species will be involved in the analyses.  Stable isotope              
              use will be used to determine the area that a particular target                
              plant utilizes so that the number of true competitors can be                   
              noted and their spatial distribution can be determined.
