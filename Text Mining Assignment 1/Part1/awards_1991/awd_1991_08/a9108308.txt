Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The American Physical Society and the Physical Society                         
              of the Soviet Union joined in supporting this cooperative                      
              program in physics.  The U.S. physicists will lecture at                       
              an International School of Physics planned for September                       
              1991 in Leningrad on the theme of "The Standard Model in                       
              High Energy Physics".  This funding will cover the                             
              travel expenses of the U.S. physicists; the Physical                           
              Society of the Soviet Union will cover their living                            
              expenses while lecturing.  There will also be partial                          
              funding from UNESCO.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The International Organizing Board will select 30 young                        
              post-doctoral physicists for admission to the School                           
              including a third to be nominated by the American                              
              Physical Society from countries other than the U.S.S.R.                        
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine comple-                          
              mentary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                            
              mutual interest and competence in the field of basic                           
              scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,                     
              and mutuality of benefit.
