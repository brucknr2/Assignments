Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is for partial support of the National Academy of                  
              Sciences/National Research Council Committee on                                
              Seismology.  The activities of this committee which are                        
              relevant to the Earthquake Hazard Mitigation program                           
              include planning and assessment of earthquake strong                           
              motion data and earthquake early warning systems; planning                     
              for symposia and workshops; and the publication of academy                     
              reports on specialized topics such as the  1987                                
              "Recommendations for the Strong-Motion Program in the                          
              United States".  This committee, in cooperation with the                       
              Committee on Earthquake Engineering, is considering                            
              methods to implement the recommendations of this report.                       
                                                                                             
              The Seismology Committee has a history of addressing areas                     
              of concern to the NSF Earthquake Hazard Mitigation                             
              program.  These activities provide an important input into                     
              earthquake hazard mitigation studies.
