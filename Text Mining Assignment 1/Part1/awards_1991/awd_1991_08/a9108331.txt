                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This project is designed to produce detailed description of the                
              syntax and semantics of the ergative construction in four                      
              morphologically ergative languages, Basque, Greenlandic Eskimo,                
              Hindi, and Warlpiri, each of which has an ergative case system.                
              The objective is to develop, in the context of a single                        
              theoretical framework, an explanatory account of certain                       
              syntactic and semantic phenomena characteristic of this important              
              linguistic type.  The theoretical framework of the project is a                
              combination of the Government and Binding theory and a version of              
              model-theoretic semantics.  The research on the four languages                 
              systematically examines the ergative construction in relation to               
              each of the principal levels of syntactic representation --                    
              Logical Form, S-structure, and D-structure -- and in relation to               
              the phenomenon of free word order, characteristic of the                       
              languages of the project.  While the four languages are                        
              reasonably representative of their type, the sample is                         
              restricted, and the project seeks to off-set this by                           
              incorporating three ancillary activities:  a survey of the                     
              literature on Mayan ergativity (represented in agreement                       
              morphology only, rather than case), a semester-long seminar on                 
              ergativity, and a colloquium series on ergativity.  A book on the              
              theoretical position of morphologically ergative languages is                  
              included as an integral part of the project.
