Abstract    :
                   This is an RUI renewal request for research aimed at the                  
              development of detectors sufficiently sensitive to be used in                  
              a search for "dark matter."  Such matter's existence is                        
              strongly suggested by a number of astrophysical measurements.                  
              It interacts gravitationally, but eludes direct observation.                   
              It may consist of weakly interacting, non-baryonic elementary                  
              particles such as neutrinos or other species predicted by                      
              grand unified theories.  Detectors of such particles require                   
              much lower threshold of sensitivity and larger cross section                   
              than offered by conventional devices.  The PI, in                              
              collaboration with Dr. B. Cabrera of Stanford U. and Dr. C. J.                 
              Martoff of Temple University has proposed the development of a                 
              "silicon crystal acoustic detector (SiCAD)" which senses                       
              ballistic phonons generated by the collision of incident                       
              particles with a nucleus or electron in a cube of ultra pure                   
              single-crystal silicon cooled below 0.1K.  The present                         
              proposal focusses upon her efforts to develop extremely                        
              sensitive superconducting tunnel junctions as phonon sensors,                  
              and uses modern integrated circuit fabrication techniques,                     
              many of which were developed locally in her S.F. State                         
              laboratory during the first three year grant.
