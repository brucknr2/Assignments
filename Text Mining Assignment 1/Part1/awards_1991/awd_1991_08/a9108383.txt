Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist from Rutgers University studying the indigenous                 
              Negrito people of the Andaman Islands, India.  These islands were              
              the site of some important ethnographic research on hunter-                    
              gatherers in the early part of this century, and have not been                 
              restudied in recent times.  This project traces the history of                 
              the Indian state's administration of the indigenous societies,                 
              the history of resettlement of mainlanders, and the diminution of              
              the native populations.  Methods involve participant observation,              
              in-depth life history interviews,  and the study of local                      
              government archives.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This project is important because the declining population and                 
              immense health and social problems of local indigenous peoples                 
              caused by their interaction with national states has been a                    
              recurring tragedy.  This case study of a group studied several                 
              generations ago will add valuable material that can help policy                
              makers understand the impact of state involvement with native                  
              peoples, and hopefully ameliorate the negative impact of the                   
              interaction.
