Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  The Principal Investigator will interview 30 to 40 English-               
              speaking 3 to 6 year old children longitudinally during a two-                 
              year period, in order to investigate wh-movement types in their                
              grammars.                                                                      
                   Several recent studies using comprehension and production                 
              tasks have suggested that English-speaking children's grammars                 
              allow types of wh-movement that do not exist in adult English.                 
              These are constructions in which a wh-phrase that appears in a                 
              lower clause at S-structure can take higher scope (over the whole              
              sentence).  Such constructions occur in other adult languages,                 
              such as German and Romani.                                                     
                   An in-depth investigation of these constructions in                       
              children's grammars will compare their properties with those of                
              German and Romani.  In this way, the project should contribute to              
              the understanding of both the children's grammars and the adult                
              grammars.
