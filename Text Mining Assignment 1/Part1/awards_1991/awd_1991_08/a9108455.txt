Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project involves the                   
              University of California, Davis and two universities in Ankara,                
              Turkey, the Middle East Technical University and Gazi University.              
              The investigators intend to study the transport of contaminants                
              in soils.  Project funding will enable Dr. Timur Dogu from Middle              
              East Technical University and Dr. Gulsen Dogu from Gazi                        
              University to work for three months in the laboratory of Drs. Ben              
              McCoy and J.M. Smith at the University of California, Davis as                 
              well as allow short research visits to Ankara by McCoy and Smith.              
              The collaborative research will investigate experimentally by use              
              of dynamic tracer methods the diffusion and adsorption processes               
              in soils.  Research results are expected to provide information                
              useful for predicting contaminant transport in both U.S. and                   
              Turkish soils.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This project in chemical engineering fulfills the program                      
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                
              experts in the United States and Turkey to combine complementary               
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                  
              interest and competence.
