Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The homeotic genes of Drosophila act as switches selecting the                 
              developmental pathway a segment will follow. These genes encode                
              transcription factors which are thought to specify segment                     
              identity by regulating other, target genes. The target genes                   
              would establish individual segmental characteristics. Although                 
              much is known about the homeotic genes, little is known about the              
              genes they control or how the homeotic gene products select among              
              their many target genes. During the past two years, a genetic                  
              search was undertaken using insertional mutagenesis to tag genes               
              required for head development. The goal was to identify genes                  
              regulating or regulated by those homeotic gene products required               
              to establish proper larval head segment identity. Three genes,                 
              having expression or phenotypic qualities suggesting they are                  
              targets of the protein encoded by the homeotic gene, Deformed,                 
              were chosen for further study. A genetic and molecular                         
              characterization of these three genes is in progress to determine              
              their role during development of the larval head. In addition,                 
              experiments are underway to test whether regulation of Deformed                
              is direct. Future experiments will use these genes as models to                
              study target gene selection by the homeotic proteins.
