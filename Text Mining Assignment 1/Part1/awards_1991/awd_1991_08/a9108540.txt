Abstract    :
                   This project is collaborative with J. George Shanthikumar of              
              University of California at Berkeley.  The principal investigator's            
              developed the notions of strong stochastic convexity and                       
              directional convexity, which are sample- path based structural                 
              properties essential to the analysis and optimal design of                     
              stochastic discrete event systems in general and queueing networks             
              in particular.  This project focuses on properties relating to                 
              structural and policy changes in queueing networks.  To model and              
              understand these changes, notions of monotonicity and convexity do             
              not apply directly.  New concepts and new machineries along the                
              lines of stochastic rearrangement and stochastic majorization will             
              be developed.  These notions provide mathematical support for                  
              "pairwise interchange" arguments that are widely used in                       
              scheduling, control, and resource allocation.  Preliminary studies             
              have demonstrated their usefulness and effectiveness in dealing                
              with structural and policy changes.  Furthermore, these properties             
              are natural extensions of stochastic convexity.                                
                   A new, unified hierarchy of (sample-path based) second-order              
              properties in queueing networks appears to be now emerging.                    
              Together, these properties will support the (static) parametric                
              design of queueing networks, and dynamic scheduling and control.
