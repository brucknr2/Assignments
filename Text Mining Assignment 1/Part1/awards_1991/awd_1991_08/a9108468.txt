Abstract    :
              The mechanical properties of polymer blends will be studied under              
              a Research Initiation Award.  The purpose is to improve these                  
              properties, and especially the large-strain behavior, by broadening            
              the interface zones by judicious use of functional groups in the               
              blends.  Polystyrene and poly(ethylene-co-propylene), which have               
              been functionalized with hydrogen bond and proton donor and                    
              acceptor sites, will be used as the constituents of model blends.              
              The degree of interfacial mixing will be determined by small angle             
              x-ray scattering and thermal analysis and related to mechanical                
              behavior.
