Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with infinite dimensional Lie                   
              algebras, their representations and their connections with                     
              mathematical physics.  The principal investigator will formulate               
              recent work of Macdonald and Stanley on symmetry polynomials in                
              terms of vertex operators in an effort to obtain the local theory              
              needed for formulating quantum field theory on an arithmetic                   
              surface.  He will also study the cohomology of the mapping class               
              group.                                                                         
                   The research supported concerns an important focus of current             
              mathematical activity, where group representation theory, quantum              
              field theory, and algebraic geometry all come together.  This work             
              has important implications for theoretical physics as well as                  
              several areas of mathematics.
