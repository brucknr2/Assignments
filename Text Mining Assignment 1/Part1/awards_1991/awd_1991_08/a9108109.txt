Abstract    :
              This project has the objective of understanding the transport of               
              electrons and holes in amorphous semiconductors, their                         
              recombination and conduction during light excitation and their                 
              local interaction with the amorphous materials.  Use will be made              
              of confining the charge carriers spatially in ultrathin layers of              
              amorphous semiconductors to explore the effects of reduced                     
              dimensionality.  The universal character of different modes of                 
              electronic conduction will be explored in various materials                    
              including those that interact strongly with electrons and are                  
              suspected of forming polarons.
