Abstract    :
              This renewal proposal presents work to be carried-out in three                 
              different areas:  (1) viscous liquids and glasses, with an emphasis            
              on the nature of the ideal glass transition; (2) liquids and glass             
              under negative pressure, with an added emphasis on the glassy state            
              under tension; (3) a computer simulation study of geochemical                  
              liquids, with an emphasis on the liquid silicates.
