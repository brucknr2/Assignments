Abstract    :
              The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                     
              (EPSCoR) in the state of Wyoming will enhance the research                     
              competitiveness of over 30 investigators working in two                        
              research clusters:  (1) Ground Water Contamination: Detection,                 
              Prediction, Remediation; and (3) Basic Research in Fossil Energy               
              Science.  The clusters will form the core of a new Center for                  
              Environment and Natural Resources at the University of Wyoming.                
              The Center will enhance Wyoming's human resources in S&E, its                  
              technological and economic development, and its fundamental                    
              science.  In addition,innovative programs for teachers and for                 
              all students, especially women and minorities, will enhance the                
              development of Wyoming's young people.                                         
                                                                                             
              Because Wyoming has no major federal or industrial research                    
              facilities, the Wyoming EPSCoR improvement plan focuses                        
              primarily on the University of Wyoming (UW).  Interactions                     
              between UW, community colleges, public schools, and                            
              technology/economic development organizations are                              
              incorporated throughout the plan.  Primary objectives                          
              include:  (1) expansion of UW's capacity to conduct S&E                        
              research through reallocation of UW funds and positions and                    
              by enhanced state support; (2) an increased pool of S&E                        
              students through development of appealing interdisciplinary                    
              programs; (3) increased interactions between UW and the                        
              Western Research Institute through joint research; and (5)                     
              increased state awareness of the role of S&E research in                       
              Wyoming's economic development through enhanced interaction                    
              with established state boards and the executive and                            
              legislative branches of state government. Over the three-                      
              year award period the State of Wyoming will contribute $3.9                    
              million to ensure the success of the EPSCoR effort.
