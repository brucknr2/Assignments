Abstract    :
              The objective of this study is to develop expertise in the                     
              analytical analyses required for development of a                              
              quantitative kinetic model for the rate of carbonyl                            
              formation in polypeptides by metal ion-catalyzed                               
              oxidations (MCO).  The long-term operation of fermentation                     
              and cell culture processes and the commercialization of                        
              therapeutic proteins have been impeded by stability                            
              problems.  Oxygen, metals, and reducing agents found in                        
              bioprocessing media combine to cause irreversible damage                       
              to proteins.  The rate constants and parametric                                
              sensitivities of this class of oxidation reactions have                        
              not been systematically studied under industrially                             
              relevant conditions, and highly reactive polypeptide                           
              sequences have not been identified.  Thus, no quantitative                     
              kinetic models exist for use in process design, control,                       
              or optimization, nor is sequence information available for                     
              protein engineering strategies.  This work intends to lay                      
              the foundation for the ultimate goal of identification of                      
              effective process and/or protein engineering strategies                        
              for minimizing oxidative damage.
