Abstract    :
              The proposed research will analyze the ethnographic context of                 
              legal proceedings involving Yup'ik natives in Western Alaska,                  
              focussing on discourse strategies and their interpretations in                 
              relation to trial outcomes. Communicative processes, including                 
              translation/interpretation and the use of legal narratives etc.,               
              are hypothesized as strongly influencing courtroom interactions and            
              possibly trial outcomes. Although informal observations suggest                
              this, the hypothesis has never been tested, and the complex range              
              of strategies used in testimony and questioning has neither been               
              documented nor analyzed. The three PIs, a cultural anthropologist,             
              a trial lawyer and a legal interpreter, propose to spend eight                 
              weeks studying public record tapes, conducting interviews, and                 
              observing trials in session. Subsequent discourse analysis will                
              provide a basis for the testing of the hypothesis.
