Abstract    :
                   This grant supports nuclear theory research by Professors G.              
              E. Walker and J. T. Londergan.  The work will continue to study                
              relativistic effects in the nuclear response function, meson                   
              production reactions and the quark/gluon structure of the                      
              nucleon.
