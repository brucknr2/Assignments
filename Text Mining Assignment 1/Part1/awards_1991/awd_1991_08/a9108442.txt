Abstract    :
              Dr. Feldmann will produce unique transformants of Arabidopsis                  
              with the seed infection procedure using the T-DNA tagging method.              
              The target is to produce 5,000 lines a year.  The transformants                
              will be screened initially on agar plates, and then in soil grown              
              plants.  All lines that have a visible alteration in phenotype                 
              will be recorded and made available to the general scientific                  
              community.  The availability of the seeds will be announced                    
              through the electronic Arabidopsis bulletin board.  Scientists                 
              who wish to screen for specific phenotypes will be permitted to                
              come to University of Arizona to do so on a case by case basis.                
              Dr. Feldmann plans to deposit the mutant lines to a national                   
              Arabidopsis resource center at the end of this grant period.  The              
              importance of seed transformation in the tagging and cloning of                
              Arabidopsis genes have been established.  It is extremely time-                
              consuming to produce the tagged lines and this project will                    
              provide invaluable resources to the plant molecular biology                    
              community.
