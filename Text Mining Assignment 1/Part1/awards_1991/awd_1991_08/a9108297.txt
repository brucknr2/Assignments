Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to undertake the                     
              first comprehensive thermal studies of vertical-cavity                         
              surface-emitting semiconductor lasers and two-dimensional                      
              laser arrays.  Although there is a general consensus that                      
              thermal problems are of utmost importance for vertical-cavity                  
              surface emitters, they remain virtually unexplored.  The                       
              underlying goal of this project is to reach a good                             
              understanding of main factors which govern the thermal                         
              behavior of vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser and to use                  
              this knowledge to improve the device performance.  In the                      
              initial phase of the project, we will concentrate on studies                   
              of individual surface-emitting lasers.  We will develop a                      
              thermal-electrical self-consistent model, with realistic                       
              distribution of heat sources and accounting for two-                           
              dimensional current- and heat spreading, and apply it to                       
              several types of state-of-the-art vertical cavity laser                        
              structures.  We will also examine impact of thermal effects in                 
              individual emitters on their integration into two-dimensional                  
              arrays.  The thermal-electrical self-consistency will then be                  
              complemented by inclusion of optical phenomena and fully self-                 
              consistent treatment will be developed to examine effects of                   
              heating on optical properties of individual surface emitters                   
              and two-dimensional arrays.  The proposed research is expected                 
              to provide important information for advanced design of high-                  
              performance vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers and two-                   
              dimensional arrays for novel applications such as optical                      
              processing and optical interconnects.
