Abstract    :
              The proposed research will include the synthesis of                            
              available piezocone data compiled from previous efforts,                       
              the collection of additional field and laboratory data, and                    
              development of a theoretically-based methodology for using                     
              complementary sets of piezocone parameters to profile the                      
              in situ stress history of natural clays. The database                          
              compilation will be used to calibrate and guide the                            
              selection of applicable piezocone parameters for the                           
              detailed profiling of overconsolidation ratio, or other                        
              relevant measure of stress history.
