Abstract    :
              The current technique of coronary angiography                                  
              requires the injection of a contrast agent                                     
              into the coronary artery; this procedure is                                    
              expensive and potentially hazardous                                            
              theoretical analysis shows that by taking the                                  
              difference between X-rays at two different                                     
              energies, and by using an appropriate                                          
              contrast agent and signal processing                                           
              techniques, coronary angiograms can be                                         
              obtained using intravenous injection.  This                                    
              proposal is to test the feasibility of the                                     
              approach without the development of an X-ray                                   
              tube that is able to handle the necessary                                      
              high electron currents.  The proposed                                          
              approach is to generate images of phantoms                                     
              using low electrode currents (form the                                         
              Brookhaven Dynamitron electron accelerator)                                    
              and using averaging to compensate for the low                                  
              current.  If the preliminary results are                                       
              promising, and follow-up work is successful,                                   
              a safer and lower cost angiographic                                            
              technology will result.
