Abstract    :
                   Research will be carried out in nucleon scattering and                    
              charge exchange reactions at LAMPF and IUCF.  Polarization                     
              observables and differential cross sections will be measured.                  
              This work will improve our understanding of effective                          
              interactions and the limits of many-body effects in quasifree                  
              knockout and delta production in complex nuclei.  In addition,                 
              studies will be carried out at Fermilab regarding nuclear                      
              decay following deep inelastic muon scattering.  Improved                      
              understanding of the recoil quark hadronization process is                     
              sought.  Limited in-house studies of neutron emission                          
              following low energy reactions will be conducted with a tandem                 
              van de Graaff accelerator.
