Abstract    :
              This activity has the potential to add significantly to the                    
              efficiency in which the public sector approaches industry-based                
              research.  NEXUS is a new effort to broker and organize                        
              collaborative research with commercial applications among firms,               
              universities, federal laboratories, and state agencies.  Its                   
              preliminary concept is a market-driven, private, nonprofit                     
              networking organization that will deliver NEXUS services and                   
              identify prototype NEXUS partnerships.  It will be implemented in              
              the 14 member states of the Southern Technology Council, of which              
              7 are participants in the NSF/EPSCoR initiative.  The potential for            
              expansion to the remaining 12 EPSCoR participants will be explored.            
              The total award is $33,060 for a one-year duration to the Southern             
              Growth Policies Board, Southern Technology Council.  The proposal              
              is recommended for funding.
