Abstract    :
              The clause-linking theorem proving method was recently developed and           
              tested on a wide variety of problems, including problems in set theory         
              and temporal logic, and logic puzzles.  This prover converts a first-          
              order problem to the propositional calculus and then applies a                 
              propositional decision procedure similar to the Davis and Putnam               
              method.  This project will extend this theorem proving method to               
              problems involving equality and term rewriting.  This involves a               
              combination of representations like Brand's modification method, with          
              traditional term-rewriting techniques.  A procedure to solve                   
              inequalities involving the lexicographic path ordering will be used to         
              approximate specialized unification algorithms.  This work will also           
              incorporate meaningful semantics to guide the search; the semantics            
              will be presented as a collection of procedures for computing the              
              meanings of function and predicate symbols in a structure, as well as          
              a procedure for deciding the satisfaction of existential sentences in          
              the structure.  Methods for generating plausible lemmas and using them         
              to guide the search for a proof, will be developed.  The prover will           
              be applied to non-trivial mathematical theorems.
