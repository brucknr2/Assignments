Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Although faced with massive job losses in recent years, labor                  
              unions in advanced industrial countries only occasionally have                 
              responded with strikes or other industrial actions.  Previous                  
              research in Political Science suggests that variations in the                  
              responses of organized labor to threats of work force reduction are            
              linked to the institutional context of labor-management relations.             
              Specifically, where seniority protects union leaders from layoffs              
              industrial actions are less common.  Research in economics suggests            
              in contrast that unions are indifferent to layoffs when the average            
              member is protected.  This research attempts to reconcile these                
              disparate perspectives and to develop a comprehensive and unified              
              political economic theory of industrial action.                                
                                                                                             
              Specifically, this award is intended to prepare this talented young            
              investigator to conduct the innovative research she proposes.                  
              Specifically, the award will be used to allow the investigator to              
              supplement her training in Political Science with additional                   
              training in Economics and econometrics.  This additional training              
              will enable the investigator to further pursue the productive line             
              of research already begun.                                                     
                                                                                             
              When completed this research should increase our understanding of              
              labor-management relations and provide insights into the causes of             
              strikes and other industrial actions.
