Abstract    :
              This proposal s to develop a new way of estimating blood flow                  
              distribution across a plane using wideband ultrasound.  The work               
              will compare the spatial and velocity resolutions that can be                  
              obtained using different estimation techniques.  A simple flow-                
              model will then be used to compare the theoretical predictions                 
              with experimental data.  If successful, the work will result in                
              improved technology for generation two-dimensional color images                
              of blood flow.  The long term outcome should be better diagnosis               
              of vascular diseases.
