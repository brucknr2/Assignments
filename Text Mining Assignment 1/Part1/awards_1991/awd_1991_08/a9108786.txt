Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              A series of Molecular Dynamics simulations on atomic arrays of                 
              several different materials of up to one million atoms in order to             
              determine critical dislocation mobility parameters is proposed.                
              These are the Peierls stress (the stress required to initiate                  
              dislocation motion), and the temperature dependent damping                     
              coefficient (obtained from the dislocation velocity as a function of           
              applied stress and temperature).  These quantities are extremely               
              difficult to measure directly, or estimate by theoretical means, yet           
              they are of considerable importance in predicting and understanding            
              the plastic response and fracture behavior of materials.  Computer             
              simulation are ideally suited, now that reliable interatomic                   
              interactions can be constructed for selected metal systems by means            
              of the Embedded Atom Method.  This program would be the first serious          
              attempt to determine these quantities for specific metals by computer          
              simulation methods.//
