Abstract    :
                 This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Smith-Huerta to             
              initiate studies of floral development in a homeotic mutant of                 
              Clarkia.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that this award will help Dr. Smith-Huerta obtain            
              preliminary results necessary to launch an independent research                
              career.
