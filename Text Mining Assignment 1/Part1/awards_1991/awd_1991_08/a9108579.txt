Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, seeks to design                   
              and build novel instrumentation for Electron Spin Resonance                    
              (ESR) imaging.  Programmed phasing of radio frequency signal                   
              inputs rather than magnetic field gradients will be employed.                  
              Lower frequencies than are commonly employed for ESR                           
              spectrometry will also be employed, reducing the problems of                   
              sample heating.  If successful, this  Grant for Exploratory                    
              Research should lead to radically different ESR imaging                        
              instrumentation than would otherwise be available.                             
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              Magnetic Resonance Imaging has profoundly improved diagnostic                  
              medicine.  Electron Spin Resonance imaging has not had the                     
              impact of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, due to instrumental as                   
              well as fundamental difficulties in generating signals.  In                    
              this research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, a novel means of                  
              generating electron spin images which may overcome several of                  
              the previously identified problems will be built and studied.                  
              This Grant for Exploratory Research is considered to be high                   
              risk, but the reward (the ability to routinely image free                      
              radicals in situ without roasting the object studied) makes the                
              risk worthwhile.
