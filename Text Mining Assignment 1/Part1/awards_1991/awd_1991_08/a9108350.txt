Abstract    :
              The primary objectives of this study are to develop a                          
              general but practical method for the analysis of isotropic,                    
              saturated cohesive soils which take into account not only                      
              material nonlinearities and thermo-mechanical coupling,                        
              but also time-dependent characteristics of soil; to develop                    
              an efficient numerical implementation of the proposed analysis                 
              method; and to verify this method by comparing numerical                       
              simulations to results of laboratory and field investigations.                 
              A generalized elastoplastic-viscoplastic bounding surface                      
              formulation will be extended to realize these objectives to                    
              advance the current state of the art in the simulation of                      
              heat and fluid flow through a deforming porous medium.
