Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              and the National Facilities and Instrumentation Program will                   
              help the Department of Chemistry at Oregon State University                    
              acquire a Nd:YAG tunable dye laser system.  The laser will be                  
              used in research projects aimed at 1) Optical Studies of New                   
              Solids and 2) Nonlinear Raman Spectroscopy.                                    
                                                                                             
              Raman Spectroscopy is concerned with vibrational and rotational                
              transitions in molecules.  The information obtained sometimes                  
              complements that obtained from an infrared study and provides                  
              valuable structural information.  Fourier-transform Raman                      
              spectroscopy with near-infrared excitation provides a powerful                 
              solution to problems of high background fluorescene or sample                  
              photodegradation or photolability and enhanced signal-to-noise                 
              quality.  Raman spectroscopy is an invaluable tool in studies                  
              of condensed-phase chemical and biomolecular systems.
