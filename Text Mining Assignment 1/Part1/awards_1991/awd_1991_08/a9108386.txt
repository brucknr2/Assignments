Abstract    :
              Resource-constrained project scheduling with cash flows is                     
              difficult due to the large number of possible combinations of                  
              tasks which can generate feasible schedules.  This had led to the              
              evolution of a variety of heuristic procedures that can aid the                
              generation of a near-optimal schedule.  Choosing the best heuristic            
              is difficult because it depends upon the particular problem;                   
              furthermore often a combination of heuristics is better; finally               
              since circumstances can change, real-time adjustment of the                    
              scheduling solution is important.  Hence the proposer will analyze             
              the feasibility of using neural networks in the selection of the               
              best heuristic algorithm for the resource-constrained project                  
              scheduling problem.
