Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Project will develop analysis capability for connected timber                  
              frames, such as mortise and tenon joints, and fork and tongue                  
              joints in post and beam construction.                                          
                                                                                             
              Results will be useful in analyzing the safety of historic                     
              structures and assure safety in new construction.
