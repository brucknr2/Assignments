Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial support a symposium on hotspots,              
              mantle plumes and related topics to be held at Caltech on May 2,               
              3, and 4.  In the past decade there have been rapid advances in                
              geochemical characterization of basalts and peridotites from                   
              various tectonic environments, in tomographic imaging of the                   
              Earth's interior and in computer modeling of hydrodynamic and plate            
              phenomena.  This PI will assemble workers in these areas for an                
              extensive discussion of the nature and origin of mantle plumes.
