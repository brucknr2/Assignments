Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A genetic approach will be taken to investigate cell                           
              specification in the embryonic pituitary.  A transgenic mouse                  
              will be made in which expression of the thymidine kinase gene                  
              will be directed to melanotropes and corticotropes using the                   
              promoter of the pro-opiomelanocortin gene.  Cells that express                 
              the transgene will be ablated and the consequences of this                     
              ablation on the differentiation of other pituitary cell types,                 
              repopulation of the pituitary with pro-opiomelanocortin cells and              
              re-differentiation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis will be                  
              determined.  These studies offer an innovative, non-invasive                   
              approach toward understanding the role of cell-cell interactions               
              in neural development and specification.
