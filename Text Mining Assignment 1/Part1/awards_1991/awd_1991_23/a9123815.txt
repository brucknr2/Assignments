Abstract    :
              The PI plans to continue the operation of the cosmic ray neutron               
              monitors at Mt. Washington (Po=1.24 GV) and Durham (Pc=1.41) and               
              to continue studies which relate these ground based cosmic ray                 
              observations to near Earth cosmic ray telescope data (E > 70 MeV)              
              from the IMP series of spacecraft and similar data at large                    
              heliocentric distances from the Earth acquired from Pioneer 10                 
              (at  53AU in August 1991), Voyager 1 (at 45.7 AU, latituded  32o)              
              and Voyager 2 (at  33 AU).                                                     
              Using these data they will study the following:                                
              1)   The interplanetary cosmic ray radial and latitudinal                      
                   gradient;                                                                 
              2)   Comparison of instantaneous and time-shifted integral E > 70              
                   MeV radial gradients;                                                     
              3)   Evaluation of the heliospheric termination boundary, its                  
                   location and its effects on cosmic rays; and                              
              4)   the association of Forbush decreases and interplanetary                   
                   magnetic field disturbances.
