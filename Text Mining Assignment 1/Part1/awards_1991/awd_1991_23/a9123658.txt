Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Graduate student Maria Cole, with direction from faculty                  
              advisor William Jungers, is studying quantitative aspects of                   
              skeletal size and shape and effects on locomotor adaptations in the            
              vertebrate group Ceratomorpha (Mammalia, Perrissodactyla) which                
              includes the living tapirs and rhinoceroses and a diverse radiation            
              of now extinct relatives, known from extensive fossils. Postcranial            
              variation will be examined with respect to differences in body                 
              size, ecology and relative phylogenetic relationship. Ceratomorphs             
              present an ideal case for assessing variation in locomotor anatomy             
              with respect to these interrelated and often confounding factors.              
              Because of enormous variation in body size (ceratomorphs include               
              the largest known land mammals in the fossil to investigate the                
              more general question of the mechanical basis for patterns of                  
              mammalian size-scaling. Analysis of external size and shape will               
              be supplemented by cross-sectional geometric data (second moment               
              of area, section moduli, cortical area) derived from computed                  
              tomography. Special attention will also be paid to long bone                   
              curvature, mechanical advantages of extensor muscles, and articular            
              size and shape. These data and analyses will provide new insights              
              into the functional anatomy and paleobiology of ceratomorphs                   
              specifically and should contribute to our understanding of general             
              principles governing diversity of structural design in the                     
              mammalian locomotor system.
