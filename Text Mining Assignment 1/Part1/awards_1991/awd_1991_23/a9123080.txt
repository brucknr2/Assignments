Abstract    :
                   The role of hybridization in the formation of new species,                
              particularly at the diploid level, is a central problem of plant               
              evolution. Graduate student Andrea Wolfe, under the direction of               
              faculty advisor Wayne Elisens at University of Oklahoma, proposes              
              to test various hypotheses of homoploid hybrid speciation in a                 
              complex of four species of herbaceous perennials in the genus                  
              Penstemon, using molecular and genetic markers. Individual plants              
              sampled throughout the range of each species will be surveyed for              
              isozyme (protein) variation and for mutational differences in                  
              chloroplast DNA and in nuclear ribosomal DNA. Because these data               
              provide genetic markers which minimize problems of character                   
              intermediacy and dominance, they are especially appropriate for                
              testing hypotheses about hybridization and introgression, and the              
              origin of new species from stabilized hybrid recombinants. The                 
              study represents a unique opportunity to test two examples of                  
              hybrid speciation in a group of closely related plants. Because                
              one purported parental species, Penstemon centranthifolius, has                
              numerous diagnostic molecular and genetic markers which distinguish            
              it from other members of this hybrid complex, the group of species             
              also offers an excellent system to test models of introgressive                
              hybridization, the "leakage" of genes from one species into                    
              another.
