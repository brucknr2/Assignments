Abstract    :
              Research on Anyons, Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE), and                 
              Localization - The research under this grant will explore the more             
              fundamental aspects of strong correlation, exotic statistics, and              
              the localization-delocalization transition, primarily in physical              
              situations where time-reversal-invarience symmetry is broken,                  
              typically by a large external magnetic field.  The proposed                    
              problems include FQHE studies in unusual systems, tunneling of                 
              anyons, quantum localization in pseudorandom potentials, edge                  
              effects in FQHE, Wigner crystallization, and two-dimensional Wigner            
              crystallization in strong magnetic fields.  Much of this work is               
              inspired by ongoing experimental work in various laboratories, and             
              an emphasis on making close connection with present and future                 
              experimental programs will be a priority.
