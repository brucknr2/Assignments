Abstract    :
                   It is commonly argued that genetic diversity is important                 
              for                                                                            
              the conservation of a threatened species.  Unfortunately, for                  
              most                                                                           
              threatened species we know little about how genetic variation in               
                                                                                             
              ecologically relevant traits (e.g. drought tolerance) may                      
              contribute to the survival of a species.  This kind of                         
              information                                                                    
              is especially important because they provide habitat for many                  
              other                                                                          
              organisms.                                                                     
              Blue oak (Quercus douglasii), a threatened keystone species in                 
              California, is currently not regenerating throughout much of its               
                                                                                             
              geographic range.  Blue oak woodlands are one of the most                      
              biologically diverse ecosystems on the planet, second only to                  
              tropical forests.  As such, a loss of this species and thus the                
              habitat it creates would result in a major reduction of                        
              biodiversity.  This study will focus on a series of field                      
              experiments designed to examine how genetic variation in                       
              morphology                                                                     
              and drought tolerance affects survival and growth in blue oak                  
              seedlings and adults.  We hope to be able to identify drought                  
              resistant and competitive oak genotypes that may be important                  
              sources of germplasm for current and future efforts to restore                 
              and                                                                            
              maintain this critically important species.//
