Abstract    :
                   The objective of the research is to develop, implement and                
              test novel concepts for improved control of composite materials                
              manufacturing process.  Advanced composite materials manufacturing             
              is expensive, labor intensive and prone to high part rejection                 
              rates.  Raw materials costs are only 5 to 15% of the total                     
              manufacturing cost.  Emerging technologies such as artificial                  
              intelligence and model-based control, combined with increased                  
              understanding of polymer processing science and technology, provide            
              a synergistic opportunity to advance the state of the art in                   
              composite manufacturing.                                                       
                   A strategy that combines an on-line process model with                    
              experimential processing knowledge will be researched.  The system             
              is intended to be adaptive and adjust the processing conditions to             
              compensate for changes in raw materials or product requirements.               
              Due to the difficulty of acquiring the processing knowledge and the            
              volatile nature of this knowledge, a strategy for constant updating            
              and improvement is also required.  To achieve this, a methodology              
              for capturing control knowledge from past operational histories of             
              the process is suggested.  The result of these innovations is an               
              intelligent processing strategy that will reduce part rejection                
              rate and hence the overall manufacturing cost.  The concept will               
              be implemented and tested on a selected process, namely the                    
              autoclave curing of composites.
