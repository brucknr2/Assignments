Abstract    :
              A multi-purpose apparatus will be developed to measure in situ the             
              pressure and temperature in tribo-contacts (roller bearings, ball              
              bearings, etc.) under normal and severe operating conditions,                  
              including loads to Hertzian pressure of 4 GPa, velocities to 40 m/s            
              and temperatures to 450 C.  The data collection effort will run in             
              parallel with a modeling effort to determine the total heat being              
              generated at the contact as functions of these operating parameters            
              as well as slip, nature of the fluid, surface coatings, etc.  The              
              model will provide detailed information on pressure and temperature            
              distribution and on traction in the contact zone.
