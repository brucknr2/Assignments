Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposed program aims to study several classes of ceramics and            
              ceramic matrix composites, representing materials with different               
              mechanisms of toughening.  The objective is to discover why and how            
              fatigue cracks grow in monolithic ceramics where toughening is                 
              induced by crack deflection and/or grain bridging, such as in                  
              coarse and fine grained Al2O3 and grain-elongated Si3N4.  Other                
              materials include the transformation and microcrack toughened                  
              ceramics such as PSZ and ZTA, the brittle fiber or whisker                     
              reinforced ceramic matrix composites such as SiC-whisker reinforced            
              alumina, and the ductile-phase toughened ceramic matrix composites             
              such as Al-toughened alumina.  Fatigue tests, together with                    
              microstructural characterization of the degradation of the                     
              crack-tip shielding (toughening) mechanisms behind the crack tip               
              and accumulated microstructural damage ahead of the tip, will be               
              used to study the micromechanism of cyclic crack-growth in these               
              materials.                                                                     
              %%%%                                                                           
              This research is designed to seek a fundamental understanding of               
              the mechanisms by which ceramics suffer cyclic fatigue failure.  A             
              number of ceramic materials, representing materials with different             
              mechanisms of toughening, will be used for this study.                         
              Microstructural characterizations together with fatigue tests are              
              used to study the micromechanisms of cyclic crack-growth in these              
              materials.
