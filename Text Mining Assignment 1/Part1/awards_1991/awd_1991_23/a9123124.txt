Abstract    :
              The new quantum mechanics, discovered, elaborated and interpreted              
              during the years 1925-28, radically transformed science and                    
              philosophy of the 20th century.  Dr. Beller is continuing her study            
              of the intellectual and psycho-social history of the quantum                   
              revolution.  This project covers two periods in the development of             
              new quantum physics and its philosophy:  the formative stage (1925             
              -28), which Dr. Beller is describing in terms of a network of                  
              dialogues; and the consolidation stage (after 1928), which she is              
              studying by focusing on the rhetorical aspect of the articulation              
              of the new quantum philosophy.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Dr. Beller has already studied many of the primary and secondary               
              sources in the history of quantum physics and has published a                  
              series of papers on this topic.  Under a previous grant, she                   
              devoted the academic year 1990-91 to this project.  Under this                 
              grant, she is continuing her study of the sources pertaining to the            
              consolidation stage of this research.  Her results will be of great            
              interest for both history and philosophy of science.
