Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data.  This proposal from the University of Alaska            
              requests funding for equipment that will be used to support NSF-               
              funded research cruises aboard the R/V ALPHA HELIX, a 133 foot                 
              vessel that is owned and operated by the University.
