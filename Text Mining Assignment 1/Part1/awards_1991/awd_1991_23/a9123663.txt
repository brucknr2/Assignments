Abstract    :
              There is a considerable need for astronomers and laboratory atomic             
              physics to confer occasionally to review recent contributions to               
              atomic data and to decide on current needs. This proposal will                 
              support a conference meeting during 14-17 September, 1992 at                   
              the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) at                  
              Gaithersburg, Maryland to accomplish this purpose.
