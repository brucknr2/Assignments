Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Professor Richard J. Saykally of the                       
              University of California, Berkeley, will study hydrogen                        
              tunneling dynamics in hydrated proton clusters and in                          
              non-classical ions using the new technique of Direct Laser                     
              Absorption Spectroscopy in Fast Ion Beams.  He will also use                   
              this technique to study small carbon clusters to elucidate                     
              their structure and dynamics.  Tunneling dynamics in partially                 
              solvated metal cations and the far infrared vibration-rotation                 
              tunneling spectra of weakly bound complexes will also be                       
              examined.  There is also a theoretical component to the project                
              consisting of the inversion of far infrared spectra of neutral                 
              weakly bound complexes to determine the potential energy                       
              surfaces.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              Increasing numbers of scientists turn to large-scale computer                  
              modeling of molecular structure and function in order to design                
              new drugs, catalysts, and artificial enzymes, to name a few                    
              applications.  However,incomplete knowledge of the weak                        
              interactions of chemistry, such as van der Waals forces and                    
              hydrogen bonding, is a serious impediment to acquiring                         
              realistic results from these calculations.  Intermolecular                     
              potentials are a critical part of the input required for these                 
              computer codes as well as for models of chemical reactions in                  
              liquids, gas-surface interactions, and protein dynamics.  The                  
              studies in this project aim at collecting and analyzing data                   
              which will be useful for determining some of these                             
              intermolecular potentials.
