Abstract    :
              The present project hinges around a central concept known as                   
              "flutter derivatives" which are quantities that need to be                     
              identified in certain aerodynamic contexts.  Such derivatives                  
              arise, for example, in regard to a body placed in a cross-wind                 
              flow, where the dimensionless form of the aerodynamic lift, drag               
              or moment is given by a coefficient C that changes according to the            
              angle of inclination of the body.                                              
                                                                                             
              The flutter derivatives C' prove to be of key importance in the                
              response of bluff structures- like long bridges- to wind, as their             
              characteristics clearly define the possible proclivity of the                  
              bridge to become unstable in the wind.                                         
                                                                                             
              Focusing on the engineering design of bridges, knowledge of the                
              coefficients C' for bridge deck forms has heretofore been acquired             
              exclusively by means of wind tunney experiment.  Now, however, with            
              advances in computational fluid dynamics, the possibility arises               
              of acquiring knowledge of C' via calculation alone.                            
                                                                                             
              such studies lie in the realm of research and development, and a               
              back-and-forth exchange between calculation and wind tunney                    
              experiment is needed.//
