Abstract    :
              This project addresses (1) means of hastening recovery of logged                
                                                                                            
              secondary rain forests, which buffer remnant primary forests from              
                                                                                             
              species losses, and (2) ways to enhance economic value of                      
              forestry lands, to relieve pressure on uncut forests, and prevent              
                                                                                             
              forest conversion to uses incompatible with maintaining                        
              biodiversity.                                                                  
              Experiments investigate potentially key roles of pioneer trees in              
                                                                                             
              recovery of Sabah Malaysia's tropical rain forests after                       
              selective logging.  In three post-logging disturbance regimes,                 
              seed addition experiments assess the extent to which pioneer                   
              patchiness after logging reflects seed availability versus site                
              specificity of pioneers.  Other studies in recently logged areas               
                                                                                             
              address seasonality of seed delivery, impact of seed predators on              
                                                                                             
              pioneer seeds, and effects of herbivore exclusion on succession.               
                                                                                             
              Date on vine-host interactions will help evaluate the                          
              effectiveness of specific plant traits in shedding vines that                  
              retard post-logging succession.                                                
              Other experiments focus on later successional stages and                       
              favorability of pioneers as "nurse plants" for recolonization by               
                                                                                             
              persistent dipterocarps.  Experiments compare dipterocarp                      
              germination and survivorship in pioneer and primary forests.                   
              Enrichment plantings of dipterocarp seedlings with and without                 
              trenching quantify below-ground competition from pioneers.                     
              Moderate liberation thinning of pioneers over dipterocarps will                
              help assess responses of different sized dipterocarps to release               
                                                                                             
              from light competition.
