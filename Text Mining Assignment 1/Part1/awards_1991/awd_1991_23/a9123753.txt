Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                    This study will examine the processes leading to the passage             
              of legislation to bail out the savings and loan industry.  The                
              study will focus on three questions:  What forces caused bank                  
              deregulation and its unintended consequences of the savings and                
              loan crisis?  What forces caused Congress and the executive federal            
              government to contradict prevailing laissez-faire philosophy and               
              agree to the most expensive bailout in United States history? What             
              actors were most critical in shaping the deregulation and bailout              
              legislation?   The study will primarily be based on data extracted             
              from the 34 volumes of testimony transcripts and supporting                    
              documents from the Congressional investigations into the crisis.               
                     The significance of the study is twofold.  It will offer                
              important insights into the events leading up to the savings and               
              loan crisis and to the social problems it in turn created.  This               
              may be useful for policy makers and it may influence the debate on             
              the future of the banking industry and in particular the savings               
              and loan industry.  The study will also contribute to our                      
              understanding of the role of the state in the shaping of corporate             
              welfare, and thus possibly to an expansion of the concept of the               
              welfare state to include not only social welfare but also the                  
              welfare of corporations and businesses.
