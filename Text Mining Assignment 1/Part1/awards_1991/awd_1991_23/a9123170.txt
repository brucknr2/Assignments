Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project proposes a causal relationship between investments in             
              knowledge (i.e., R&D expenditures) and in physical capital (i.e.,              
              machinery and equipment).  The basic idea is that a successful                 
              completion of R&D projects, i.e., innovations, necessitates                    
              physical investments which embody the new ideas.  Only then can the            
              innovator generate a flow of profits from the new idea.  This will             
              be embedded in an industry equilibrium framework, suggesting that              
              the evolution of industry (in terms of prices, quantities, entry               
              and exit, R&D expenditures, etc.) can be explained via the                     
              mechanics of R&D innovations implementations.  In particular, one              
              can explain why R&D expenditures cause (in a statistical sense)                
              physical investments, and why they are less volatile.
