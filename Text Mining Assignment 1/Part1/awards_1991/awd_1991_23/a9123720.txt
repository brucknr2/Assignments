Abstract    :
              This project will advance knowledge about design of intelligent                
              agents.  It has two objectives.  The first objective is the                    
              development of mathematical insights and procedures for automating             
              feature discovery and learning by evolution -- two biologically                
              inspired forms of long-term learning -- in the construction of                 
              automatic pattern classifiers.  The second objective is the                    
              incorporation of automated feature discovery and evolution in                  
              automatic analyzers of large-scale image data banks and                        
              time-varying visual signals.  This project will work to achieve                
              these objectives by building on the Principal Investigator's and               
              his students' techniques of adaptive hyperplane placement, window              
              training (an extended form of stochastic approximation), relaxed               
              branch-and-bound search, and genetic feature selection.  The                   
              project will implement and test the resulting mechanisms of                    
              long-term learning in three-stage neural classifiers of handwritten            
              numerical characters, tree classifiers of medical images in a large            
              data bank, and adaptive segmenter of moving objects in digitized               
              video.  This project will contribute to the technology of long term            
              learning in intelligent machines and to multi-sensor robotic vision            
              by automating the discovery of highly discriminating combinations              
              of features from diverse sensors.
