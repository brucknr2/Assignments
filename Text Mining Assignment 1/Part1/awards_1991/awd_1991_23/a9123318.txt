Abstract    :
                    This research is concerned with a variety of problems in                 
              linear algebra.  One of the principal investigators will study                 
              the dependency of zero patterns and signs on matrix invariants;                
              error-correcting codes defined by a greedy algorithm; integer                  
              lattices generated by combinatorially defined classes of                       
              matrices; computational procedures for certain classes of                      
              permanents; and the relation of posets to matrices. The other                  
              principal investigator will work on non-negative matrices; the                 
              related class of M-matrices and their generalizations; scaling of              
              matrices; and inertia theory of matrices.                                      
                   A matrix is a rectangular array with possible entries from a              
              wide variety of rings.  This is a field which originated in the                
              nineteenth century as a part of algebra.  It is currently very                 
              active in view of its many applications and connections with                   
              other parts of mathematics and other scientific and technical                  
              disciplines.
