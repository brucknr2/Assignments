Abstract    :
              It is a goal of our proposals to investigate the collisionless                 
              processes for energy and momentum exchange in plasma via excitation            
              and absorption of plasma waves.  Two different types of waves are              
              to be considered: Alfven waves that organize the momentum transfer             
              between counterstreaming ion populations via pitch angle scattering            
              of resonant particles and lower hybrid waves that are very                     
              effective in energy transfer from ion sources of free energy to                
              plasma electrons.                                                              
              For Alfven waves we are planning the solution of two following                 
              problems:  the excitation of strongly nonlinear Alfven waves in a              
              form of shocklets by counterstreaming ions, appearing in the solar             
              wind in the upstream region of planetary and cometary bow-shocks,              
              and the cosmic ray transport by galactic wind due to coupling                  
              between these two plasmas caused by Alfven waves.                              
              For lower hybrid waves, excited by ion beams in a plasma, the                  
              nonlinear theory is to be contructed describing the saturation of              
              the lower hybrid instability by nonlinear wave cascading and wave              
              absorption by plasma electrons and ions.  The most important                   
              cascade mechanism that is to be under detailed analysis, is the                
              modulational instability and collaspe of lower hybrid waves.                   
              Finally, as the possible example of collective interactions in                 
              collisional dominated plasma, the formation of the weak                        
              electrostatic shock inside the cometary ionosphere would be                    
              considered.
