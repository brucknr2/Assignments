Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Program Summary:                                                               
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data.  This proposal from the Woods Hole                      
              Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) requests funding for equipment that             
              will be used to support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the                 
              R/V's KNORR, ATLANTIS II and the OCEANUS.  The KNORR and the AII               
              were constructed with NSF support, and the OCEANUS is owned by the             
              NSF.  All three vessels are operated by the Institution and provide            
              extensive support to NSF funded oceanographic research projects.
