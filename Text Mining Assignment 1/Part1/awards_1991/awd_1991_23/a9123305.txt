Abstract    :
              This award from the Science in Developing Countries -                          
              Latin America program will support a regional research                         
              symposium on Mathematical Logic, to be held in Bahia                           
              Blanca, Argentina in July 1992. Organizers are Dr.                             
              Richard A. Shore of Cornell University  and Dr. R.                             
              Cignoli of the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.                         
              The goal of the symposium is to encourage the                                  
              development of logic and its connections with computer                         
              science in latin America by presenting current work                            
              and research problems as well as developing                                    
              opportunities for collaborative research between U.S.                          
              and Latin American logicians.                                                  
                                                                                             
              As part of the symposium, six U.S. participants will                           
              present the results of recent research.  The areas                             
              that will be emphasized include set theory, algebraic,                         
              categorical and nonclassical logic and the relations                           
              of the last two to computer science.  The benefits to                          
              both U.S. and Latin American participants are the                              
              development of new areas for regional research                                 
              cooperation and the potential for improving the                                
              nations' scientific infrastructure.
