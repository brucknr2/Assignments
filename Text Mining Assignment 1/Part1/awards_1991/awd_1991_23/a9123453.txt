Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to continue to develop an experimental             
              basis for understanding the behavior of volatiles in submarine                 
              basaltic magmas.  The solubility of carbon dioxide will be measured            
              over the range of pressures and temperatures corresponding to those            
              at which submarine magmas erupt.  The influence of water on the                
              solubility of carbon dioxide in mid-ocean ridge basalt liquids will            
              also be measured.  Experiments will also be conducted to study the             
              kinetics of bubble nucleation and growth in basaltic systems.
