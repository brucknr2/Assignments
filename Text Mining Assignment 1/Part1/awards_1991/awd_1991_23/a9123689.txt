Abstract    :
                   This grant supports theoretical work to analyze baryon                    
              structure and baryon-meson coupling employing relativistic                     
              corrections to the constituent quark model.  The electron                      
              excitation of the nucleon will be investigated and the nature                  
              of the interactions between nucleons and hyperons.
