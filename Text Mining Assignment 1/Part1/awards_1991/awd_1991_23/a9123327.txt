Abstract    :
                   This action will provide support for a workshop whose                     
              subject concerns the nature of the radiation from outer space                  
              consisting of ghost like particles called neutrinos.                           
              Theorists have predicted several sources for these particles                   
              which arise from radioactive beta decays of other forms of                     
              cosmic rays.  The various possible sources for neutrinos are                   
              expected to have different energies, and to come in vastly                     
              differing quantities.  The workshop will focus upon these                      
              models, and attempt to arrive at a consensus for estimates of                  
              neutrino fluxes and energies.  Such estimates are of                           
              considerable importance to planned future experiments whose                    
              goals and techniques will also be examined.
