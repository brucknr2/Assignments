Abstract    :
              The work is on the development of high strength, high toughness                
              cementitious materials.  The study will consider the chemical and              
              phase compositions and their influence on properties of this                   
              class of materials.  Special emphasis is placed on decreasing                  
              defect content in this class of materials.//
