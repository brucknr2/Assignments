Abstract    :
              This proposal for the third and fourth year of an intended six-year            
              project, will determine the trace element and isotopic systematics             
              (Sr, Nd, Pb) of minerals and whole-rocks from contiguous layers in             
              the Horman Peridotite.  These data are being integrated with new               
              and previous whole-rock and mineral major element analyses.                    
              Interpretations of the comprehensive data generated in this                    
              collaborative U.S.-Japan effort will enable the PIs to understand              
              the processes that created compositional variations and layering               
              within the Horoman Peridotite.  As a result, they expect to                    
              significantly improve the understanding of melt formation,                     
              migration and segregation in the upper mantle.  In addition, this              
              peridotite is in an arc tectonic setting, and it may be an example             
              of how oceanic asthenosphere is modified by subduction processes.              
              Therefore, the results of this research may contribute to an                   
              understanding of the arc volcanism that results from plate                     
              convergence.
