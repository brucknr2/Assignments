Abstract    :
                   The subjects of graph theory, applied combinatorics, and                  
              algorithms are of great current interest in mathematics, with                  
              applications to a variety of fields.                                           
                   This project will support the Seventh International                       
              Conference on Graph Theory, Combinatorics, Algorithms, and                     
              Applications to be held from June 1-5, 1992 at Western Michigan                
              University.  The conference will include both invited talks and                
              contributed papers.  Special efforts will be made to attract                   
              recent doctoral recipients to attend and present their work, to                
              stimulate them with ideas at the frontier of the subject, and to               
              help them build collaborative relationships with leading                       
              researchers in the field.  A refereed proceedings, similar to                  
              those for previous conferences in this series, is planned to be                
              published.
