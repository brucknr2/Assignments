Abstract    :
              The objective is a two-way coupling pseudo-spectral method for                 
              the direct numerical simulation of turbulent flow of                           
              suspensions near a wall.  A particle following Lagrangian -                    
              Eulerian approach will be adopted.  The particle effect will                   
              be introduced by a combined two-step successive computational.                 
              In the first step, the fluid flow field will be simulated, and                 
              then the flow about each particle.  The results will be                        
              compared to two-phase flow visualization results in a boundary                 
              layer.  The computer program can handle a large number of                      
              particles within a turbulent field.                                            
                                                                                             
              The proposed direct numerical simulation may lead to an                        
              improved understanding of the two-phase flow microstructure,                   
              as well as provide different statistics on two-phase flow                      
              useful for the constitutive relationships in the averaged flow                 
              equations.
