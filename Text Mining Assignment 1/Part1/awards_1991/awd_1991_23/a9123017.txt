Abstract    :
              Due to the disparate nature of environmental conditions in oceanic             
              and freshwater systems, the characteristics of these environments              
              strongly influence total population structure of species with                  
              plastic life history patterns.  To conduct meaningful research on              
              these processes, it is essential to identify which life history                
              stages and/or environmental events are significant.  The Arctic                
              charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) is characterized by a variety of                 
              morphological types.  These morphs appear to be reflect differences            
              in environmental conditions.  This project will investigate the                
              relationships between morph, growth and environmental history.                 
                                                                                             
              This research will apply novel analytic techniques to evaluate the             
              periods in the life history of the Arctic charr.  The otoliths of              
              fish have incorporated within their structural and chemical                    
              components a large amount of life history and physiological                    
              information.  Age, growth rate and environmental perturbations                 
              will be determined from otolith microstructure, while                          
              environmental trends in the history of an individual will be                   
              determined through elemental composition analyses of otoliths.                 
              The result of these investigations will be a comprehensive and                 
              detailed understanding of physiologically and ecologically                     
              induced changes in otolith microstructure and chemical                         
              composition.   This knowledge is vital to an understanding of the              
              processes foundational to adaptable life history patterns and                  
              should make it possible to link growth and migration to                        
              nutritional and environmental occurrences.
