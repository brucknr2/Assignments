Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The absence of central political authorities at the international              
              level implies that problems of global environmental change can be              
              resolved only if national governments and other relevant                       
              organizations find some way to cooperate with each other.                      
              Researchers on common pool resources (CPRs) and international                  
              regimes, although working separately and for the most part without             
              awareness of each other, have identified remarkably similar design             
              principles underlying successful self-organized cooperative                    
              solutions to problems of collective action.  In this project, the              
              investigators will examine the relevance of these same theoretical             
              principles to global cooperation on environmental change by                    
              convening a multidisciplinary conference in which prominent                    
              researchers in the fields of common pool resources and                         
              international regimes, along with political scientists who have                
              worked on global environmental problems, will present papers and               
              engage in intensive discussion.  The investigators are interested              
              in environmental protection and environmental change for policy as             
              well as scientific reasons.  Their analysis may assist                         
              practitioners in designing more effective institutions to protect              
              ecological values.  Thus, this project fits well under the Human               
              Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Initiative.
