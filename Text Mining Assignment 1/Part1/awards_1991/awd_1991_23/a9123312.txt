Abstract    :
              The aim of the proposed research is to develop methods for                     
              predicting stress distributions within geosynthetic reinforcements             
              at working loads through an integrated program of experimental                 
              measurements and analytical modelling. Measurements of load                    
              transfer onto reinforcing inclusions will be achieved using the                
              Automated Plan Strain Reinforcement (APSR) cell developed recently             
              at MIT. Experiments will be performed using a dry sand with                    
              different classes of geosynthetic inclusions including: a)                     
              polymeric sheets ('geomembrane materials'), b)grids, c) woven                  
              fabrics, and d) non-woven fabrics. The results of the study will               
              help to provide a rational basis for selection of reinforcing                  
              materials in design.
