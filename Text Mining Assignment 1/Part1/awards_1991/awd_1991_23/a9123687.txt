Abstract    :
                   This Research Experiences for Undergraduates award continues              
              support for a highly successful mathematical activity at the                   
              University of Washington.  Ten students will receive support in                
              each of the next three years.  They will work with two                         
              experienced faculty advisors on a broad range of questions                     
              generally classified as inverse problems. The problems involve                 
              both discrete and continuous environments with a decided slant                 
              toward physical applications.  In gaining insight to the                       
              problems, computer experimentation will play a major role.                     
                   Students will investigate problems associated with the                    
              computation of values of conductors in a network, on discrete                  
              versions of inverse problems in magneto-telluric theory and in                 
              gravitational theory.  The fundamental issue is that of                        
              determining the conductivity throughout the interior of a                      
              conducting body from measurements of potential and currents on                 
              the surface.  Similar questions arise in attempts to determine                 
              the shape of a gravitational mass from measurements of                         
              gravitational potential on the surface.                                        
                   Students will work in small teams and will submit papers on               
              their research at the end of the program.                                      
                   The record of former students at this site is one of                      
              significant success. A number are pursuing graduate science                    
              degrees at outstanding U.S. institutions.  It is expected that                 
              this trend will continue.
