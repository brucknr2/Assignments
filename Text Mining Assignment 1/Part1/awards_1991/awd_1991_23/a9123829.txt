Abstract    :
              The aim of the proposed research is to clarify the band structures             
              and fundamental properties of quantum wells and superlattices                  
              constructed from semiconductors of the II-VI family, of which CdTe             
              is a representative member.  The methods to be employed involve the            
              measurement of photoluminescence, photoluminescence excitation and             
              optical absorption spectra at ambient and low temperatures and                 
              hydrostatic pressures up to 100 kilobars generated in anvil cells.             
              The pressure dependences of the band structures of the constituent             
              semiconductors of the quantum wells and superlattices are well                 
              established.  Thus from measurement of the changes with pressure of            
              the optical properties one can extract those properties                        
              attributable to the specific geometry of the quantum wells and                 
              superlattices.  The use of high pressure in the investigation of               
              superlattices offers the best method under certain circumstances of            
              determining the energy offset between the valence band extrema of              
              the constituent pair of semiconductors.  An important method of                
              measuring this offset, which is crucial to the defemination of all             
              superlattice properties, is suggested.  Collaborative arrangements             
              have been made with other scientists to assure a ready supply of               
              state-of-the-art research materials.
