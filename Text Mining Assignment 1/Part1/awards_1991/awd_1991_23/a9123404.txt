Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This new symposium on nobel form of carbon is organized by the                 
              Material Research Society because of the recent explosion of                   
              interest in physical and chemical forms of carbon.  It shall                   
              include 8 half-day sessions to be held during April 27-May 1, 1992             
              in San Francisco.  Each session shall include one to two invited               
              speaker and a number of contributed papers.  The objective is to               
              bring together researchers working in different sub-fields to                  
              discuss topic such as diamond and diamond-like film, spherical                 
              carbon molecules, novel composites, and extraterrestrial carbon.               
              Funds requested from the National Science Foundation (NSF) will be             
              used as partial travel expense for the invited speakers and limited            
              number of outstanding graduate students.  A total of 14 prominent              
              invited speakers have confirmed their participation at this                    
              meeting.  This proposal is co-funded by SSC ($1000) and CHEM                   
              ($1000) with the total support of $2000.
