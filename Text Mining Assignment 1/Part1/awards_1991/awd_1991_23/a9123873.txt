Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              Colorado at Boulder acquire a Cryogenic Heliplex System, which                 
              will be used with an EPR-ENDOR spectrometer to enable magnetic                 
              measurements at low temperatures.  The equipment will be used                  
              in research investigations in the following areas of chemistry:                
              1)  reactive intermediates, 2) transition metal complexes                      
              containing quinone liqands, and 3) cooperative phenomena in                    
              molecular systems.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Cryogenics relates to production and maintenance of very low                   
              temperature, and the study of phenomena at these temperatures.                 
              The cryostat which will be purchased with this award willallow                 
              measurements to be made at temperatures near absolute zero.
