Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The object of this research is to find a suitable theory which            
              can describe the size distribution of raindrops as a function of               
              time.  The principle effects which must be included are drop                   
              coalescence, breakup, evaporation, and sedimentation.  Particular              
              emphasis will be devoted to the consequences of small variations in            
              the fragment distribution function; the ensuing analysis should                
              establish the robustness of the breakup formulation.
