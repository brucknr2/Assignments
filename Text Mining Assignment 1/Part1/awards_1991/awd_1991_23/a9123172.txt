Abstract    :
              Professor David Oxtoby is supported by a grant from the                        
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              theoretical studies of the liquid state.  His research is                      
              directed toward the fundamental properties that underlie the                   
              phase transitions between gas, liquid, and crystalline                         
              states of matter.  Major emphasis is placed on studying the                    
              dynamics of these state changes, the rates of nucleation and                   
              the rates of crystal growth.  Oxtoby will employ modern                        
              statistical mechanics methods which he has developed,                          
              especially density functional methods, to study these                          
              problems.  Applications include the condensation of liquids                    
              from the vapor, the crystallization of colloidal fluids, and                   
              the rapid solidification of metal alloys.

              Nucleation is a very important physical process which has                      
              important implications in such diverse areas as atmospheric                    
              chemistry and metallurgy.  The dynamics of phase changes                       
              depend critically on the nucleation process.  Professor                        
              Oxtoby has pioneered the development of a theoretical                          
              technique known as density functional theory which he is                       
              using to study gas phase to liquid phase nucleation, and                       
              liquid phase to solid phase nucleation.
