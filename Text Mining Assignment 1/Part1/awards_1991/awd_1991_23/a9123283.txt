Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in                 
              galactic astronomy between Paul W. Hodge of the University of                  
              Washington and Harvey MacGillivray of the Royal Observatory in                 
              Edinburgh, United Kingdom.  The objective of the research is to                
              search for and identify and characterize star clusters in the                  
              Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud using unique                       
              instrumentation at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh.  Dr. Hodge              
              brings to this collaboration his extensive knowledge about the                 
              cluster system and stellar content of the Magellanic Clouds and                
              other local galaxies.  He has some of the best 4-meter telescope               
              plates of the Magellanic Clouds.  This is complemented by Dr.                  
              MacGillvray's extensive experience in image analysis and access to             
              the Royal Observatory's COSMOS instrument which is considered                  
              to be the finest plate-scanning instrument and software in the                 
              world.  The COSMOS machine will be used to scan the 4-meter                    
              telescope plates in order to eventually obtain a complete map of the           
              Magellanic Clouds' clusters.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud are very useful                
              objects for the general study of clusters, their evolution and                 
              formation, and for understanding the history of these two galaxies.            
              The results of this research will provide astronomers with new                 
              clusters to study.  It will also advance understanding of the                  
              evolution of galaxies in general.
