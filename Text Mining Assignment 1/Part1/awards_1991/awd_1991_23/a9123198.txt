Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The electrodynamics of proximity-coupled superconductor/normal-                
              metal bilayers and multilayers will be explored, to uncover the                
              basic physics of transferred superconductivity.  A related novel               
              practical application is the reduction of the inductance of high-              
              speed superconducting transmission lines.
