Abstract    :
              This is a small invitational planning workshop on Scientific                   
              Collaboration and Interaction with Remote, Unique Facilities held              
              on the campus of the University of Michigan on January 21-24,                  
              1992.  A major function of the workshop is to bring together                   
              members of the scientific research community who are engaged in                
              collaborative experimental research using a unique, remote                     
              facility, with technologists and social scientists working on                  
              collaborative technology.   The researches are engaged in upper                
              atmospheric and space research utilizing the Sondre Stromfjord,                
              Greenland Upper Atmospheric  Research Facility.  The goal of the               
              workshop is to develop a plan to implement and testbed                         
              collaborative tools to be utilized by scientists engaged in                    
              collaborative and observational research using this facility.                  
              Included in these plans are design of a system for accessing the               
              instruments at this facility from remote locations, such as at                 
              the University of Michigan.   It is expected that the output of                
              this workshop will be a proposal for establishing the                          
              experimental testbed for this collaborative effort.
