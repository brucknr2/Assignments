Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Social concerns with the consequences of climatic change require               
              evidence of its effects on ecological systems on land and at sea.              
              In both habitats humans intervene, e.g., deforestation, pollution              
              of lakes, and marine harvesting.  In addition, "natural"                       
              fluctuations driven by internal ecological processes also occur.               
              Therefore, there is a definite need to monitor the long-term                   
              variability of populations, communities and ecosystem, and                     
              especially to understand the underlying processes so as to                     
              separate the different causal factors.                                         
                                                                                             
              Marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecologists are actively                     
              engaged in analysis and planning of long-term data sets.                       
              However, ecological interpretations of these data sets differ in               
              detail, even though researchers have common questions about                    
              ecological concepts.  Dr. Steele will hold a month-long summer                 
              school in 1992 at Cornell University that will bring together                  
              practitioners for the different disciplines to exchange                        
              information about data sets, methods of analysis and theoretical               
              explanations.  The steering committee will invite 15-20 students               
              at the graduate or post-doctoral levels, and approximately 10                  
              lecturers.  This workshop follows a successful 1991 summer school              
              at Cornell University.
