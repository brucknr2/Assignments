Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor D. Zeilberger               
              to work in combinatorics and special functions.  He intends to work            
              on the Macdonald conjecture, the conjecture of Askey and Gessel on             
              positivity of coefficients of certain rational power series and                
              that of Mills, Robbins, and Rumsey on alternating sign matrices.               
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
