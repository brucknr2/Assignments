Abstract    :
                   The primary goal of this project is to research and develop               
              the use of the qualitative reasoning paradigm for providing                    
              intelligent support to the preliminary aspects of simulation                   
              model design.  Specifically, the research will be targeted at the              
              application of qualitative reasoning to the description                        
              validation and the conceptual model design activities.  In order               
              to achieve this goal, the specific Phase II objectives are to                  
              develop ontologies for a specific manufacturing system domain and              
              the simulation modeling domain; to extract and formalize Common                
              Sense Principles of System Operation; to refine the IDEF3 model-               
              theoretic semantics; to research and prototype a qualitative                   
              reasoning engine comprising ontological and common sense                       
              reasoning components; and to demonstrate the application of this               
              qualitative reasoning engine to the tasks of description                       
              validation and conceptual model design.                                        
                   The main benefits of the proposed research will be to                     
              provide intelligent support for the initial analysis and model                 
              design tasks of the simulation modeling proces; to enhance the                 
              productivity of both the domain expert nd the simulation analyst;              
              and to enhance the acceptance of simulation modeling techniques                
              by decision makers in industry and business.  The results of this              
              research have the potential to make a significant impact on the                
              state-of-the-art in simulation modeling technology.
