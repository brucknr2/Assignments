Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this proposal is to develop solid membranes                   
              for the purposes of separating mixtures of gases and for the                   
              transport of metal ions.  The proposal extends and builds on                   
              research the PI has been undertaking in this area over the                     
              past several years, and which has been funded by two NSF                       
              grants (CBT-8611646 (1986-1989) and CTS-8912634 (1989-1992)).                  
              The most recent grant (CTS-8912634) examined two processes, a                  
              separation of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen, and a                        
              separation of copper ion from iron and nickel.  The first                      
              process was not successful, but high selectivity was obtained                  
              for the separation of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen by                    
              using a polyvinylammonium thiocyanate membrane.  In a set of                   
              careful experiments, the PI demonstrated that the mechanism                    
              for this selectivity is the reaction of ammonia with the                       
              thiocyanate moiety attached to the polymer backbone.  This                     
              reaction produces ammonium thiocyanate, a salt in which                        
              ammonia is very soluble.  Additional ammonia then dissolves in                 
              the salt, and diffuses across this membrane through the salt.                  
              Unfortunately, the selectivity decreases as the temperature                    
              increases (presumably because of the lower solubility of                       
              ammonia in the salt), and these membranes are not useful at                    
              the high temperatures of industrial interest in ammonia                        
              synthesis.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The proposal suggests two studies.  The first is again an                      
              ammonia separation.  The PI has begun to investigate                           
              persulfonic acid membranes.  He has found that these retain a                  
              sixty to one selectivity of ammonia to nitrogen at the high                    
              temperatures of relevance to ammonia synthesis.  The new                       
              proposal suggests characterizing the selectivity of these                      
              membranes in more detail, and identifying the mechanism of                     
              selectivity.  The second study is concerned with developing                    
              membranes for the selective and rapid transport of lithium                     
              ion.  Such membranes can play a crucial role in the design of                  
              a rechargeable lithium battery.
