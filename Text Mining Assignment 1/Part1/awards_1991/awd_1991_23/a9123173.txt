Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide partial support for a workshop regarding               
              transformations of organic molecules on molecular metal clusters               
              and on metal surfaces.  The objective is to establish connections              
              between cluster and surface chemistry.  The coordinators for the               
              event, to be held in Italy, are Edward Rosenberg, of the California            
              State University Foundation, Northridge, and Luciano Milone, of                
              the University of Turin in Italy.                                              
                                                                                             
              The workshop will bring together leading scientists involved in two            
              related and important areas of research that have many features of             
              their chemistry in common, but which are generally investigated by             
              significantly different methodologies.  By bringing together                   
              scientists from the two disciplines to discuss their latest research           
              findings, the concepts, principles, and problems that these areas              
              have in common will be more fully revealed.  This, in turn, should             
              lead to a better understanding of the chemistry involved and                   
              stimulate new ideas and directions for future research.  Because               
              Italy has traditionally been a center of excellence in cluster                 
              chemistry, and the US has particular strengths in surface science,             
              the joint workshop brings together complementary expertise from                
              the two countries.
