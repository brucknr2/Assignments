Abstract    :
              This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                
              Chemistry Program, focusses on the use of lanthanide ion                       
              luminescence to investigate diffusion-enhanced energy transfer                 
              between lanthanide energy donors and inorganic acceptors. The                  
              objective is to develop an understanding of resonant exchange                  
              energy transfer previously shown to dominate these systems and                 
              of chiral discrimination in the energy transfer between chiral                 
              lanthanide and chiral inorganic ions.  Also to be examined are                 
              lanthanide complexes as intercalation agents for probes of                     
              double-helical DNA and as targeted MRI agents, further studies                 
              of the photophysics of sensitized luminescence for immunoassay                 
              analytical applications, and characterization of siderophore                   
              and model siderophore complexes of lanthanide ions.  Molecular                 
              mechanics/dynamics calculations will be used to direct the                     
              design of certain reagents, particularly in chiral recognition                 
              and DNA intercalation.

              This project is concerned with the use of the special                          
              luminescence characteristics of lanthanide ions that result                    
              from laser irradiation to examine a variety of chemical events                 
              and to develop improved methods that may have potential for the                
              study of metal ion-protein and metal ion-DNA interactions, and                 
              ultimately for clinical analyses.
