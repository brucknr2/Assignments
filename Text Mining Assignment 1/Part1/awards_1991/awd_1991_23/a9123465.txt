Abstract    :
                   McClanahan intends to continue his study of the K-theory of               
              operator algebras, with emphasis on those that arise as reduced C*-            
              algebras of groups.  He will use Lance's six term exact sequence of            
              K-groups to obtain the K-groups of the reduced noncommutative                  
              unitary group C*-algebra and the reduced noncommutative Grassmanian            
              C*-algebra.  He then intends to use the techniques of Pimsner in               
              order to generalize this exact sequence to include a certain class             
              of full and reduced amalgamated products of C*-algebras.                       
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These seemingly                
              abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For               
              example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is                 
              currently being used to study the structure of DNA.
