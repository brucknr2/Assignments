Abstract    :
                   This award supports a study of the temporal and spatial                   
              nature of an apparently extensive and protracted Pliocene warming              
              which has been cited as a model for global climate warming.                    
                   Marine pollen and siliceous microfauna from the Japan Sea                 
              and the northwest Pacific will be analyzed at 10-20ka intervals                
              in order to : (1) document the nature and rate of variation of                 
              northeast Asian terrestrial ecosystems; (2) define the nature and              
              variation in offshore water masses and associated northwest                    
              Pacific and Sea of Japan oceanographic and circulation changes;                
              (3) develop a model of early and middle Pliocene northeast Asian               
              monsoon variability in the time and frequency domain; (4) compare              
              our data with comparable paleoclimatic data elsewhere to assess                
              the spatial and temporal character of the Pliocene warm event;                 
              (5) contribute regional terrestrial and marine paleoclimatic data              
              to verify the results of general circulation model experiments                 
              investigating the roles of orbital, atmospheric and oceanic                    
              forcing in global climate warming.
