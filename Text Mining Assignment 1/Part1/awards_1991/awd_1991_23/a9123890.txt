Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The time immediately following the metamorphosis and settlement                
              of benthic organisms is critical to their ability to become part               
              of the existing community.  Because of their small size and                    
              simpler morphology, juveniles endure more intense interactions                 
              with a wider spectrum of species.  In addition, tremendous                     
              changes in the ecological relationships between species can occur              
              between life-history stages and the importance of these study                  
              will focus on the settling and juvenile stages of 7 dominant                   
              species within subtidal marine epifaunal communities along the                 
              coast of southern New England.  The study sites chosen exhibit                 
              extreme (1 to 2 orders of Magnitude) differences in larval                     
              settlement, and each has a distinct group of dominant species.                 
              Experiments will be conducted to test processes that predation to              
              recruitment, i.e. differences in larval settlement and examine                 
              how relationships change with life-stage.  The importance of any               
              event occurring during juvenile life-history stages will be                    
              judged relative to phenomena occurring during larval settlement                
              and within the adult community.
