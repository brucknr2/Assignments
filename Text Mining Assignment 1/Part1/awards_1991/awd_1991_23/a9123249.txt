Abstract    :
                   The project is to develop a theory of quasitriangular                     
              subalgebras of semifinite von Neumann algebras.  Some of the                   
              problems that will be studied are: characterizations of elements in            
              a quasitriangular algebra, proximinality questions, locality,                  
              applications of finite width CSL algebras, external nests, and                 
              hyperreflexivity questions in B(H).  Connection with interpolation             
              theory, harmonic analysis and control theory will be pursued.  The             
              proposed methods include joint operator norm/Hilbert-Schmidt norm              
              approximations, and density arguments.                                         
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These seemingly                
              abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For               
              example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is                 
              currently being used to study the structure of DNA.
