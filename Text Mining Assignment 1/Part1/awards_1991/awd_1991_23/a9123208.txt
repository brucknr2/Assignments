Abstract    :
                   This project involves mathematical analysis and simulation                
              of two models for carrier transport.  These are: the hydrodynamic              
              model and the energy transport model (the RT model,) both for                  
              conventional devices.  Simulation of HFET devices, a quantum                   
              hydrodynamic model, will also be carried out.  The model provides              
              for tunneling effects in heterogenous structures, or compound                  
              semiconductors.  The algorithms to be employed for the two                     
              dimensional simulations are the essentially non-oscillatory shock              
              capturing algorithms, and projection methods.                                  
                   The objective is to produce computer simulation of                        
              conventional semiconductor devices, based upon different                       
              mathematical models, by use of new algorithms developed during                 
              the last decade.  A cutting edge type of diode, the so-called                  
              tunnel diode, will be studied in terms of a quantum mechanical                 
              model.
