Abstract    :
                   The objective of this study is to assess the current state of             
              the United States pharmaceutical manufacturing industry with                   
              respect to its counterparts in Japan, England, France and Germany.             
              The effort will consider research issues in automation,                        
              manufacturing and drug development and delivery systems coupled                
              with government regulations to develop a competitive benchmark for             
              pharmaceutical manufacturing in the United States versus foreign               
              competition.                                                                   
                   A major product of this endeavor will be the identification               
              of research areas and trends where production systems methodologies            
              can play a vital role in the future development of this                        
              manufacturing sector.
