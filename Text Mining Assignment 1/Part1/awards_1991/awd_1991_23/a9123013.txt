Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data.  This proposal from the University of Hawaii            
              requests funding for equipment that will be used to support                    
              NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V MOANA WAVE, a 210 foot              
              vessel that is owned by the NAVY and operated by the University.
