Abstract    :
              This Science in Developing Countries award will                                
              support the research collaboration of Professor Mark                           
              Ashbaugh of the university of Missouri, Columbia, and                          
              Professor Raphael Benguria of the Pontificia                                   
              Universidad Catolica de Chile.  The project aims to                            
              solve conjectures related to the mathematical                                  
              dimensions of circular drums.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The researchers propose to develop good bounds for the                         
              ratio of the first overtone to the fundamental tone in                         
              "warped" drums, which span a closed curve in three-                            
              dimensional space.  They will also consider other                              
              types of surfaces, such as a piece of a sphere's                               
              surface, which are of great importance to the geometry                         
              of curved surfaces.  Through techniques used in                                
              earlier collaborations, the investigators will examine                         
              bounds for ratios o other tones as well, in order to                           
              improve existing bounds and perhaps obtain the optimal                         
              bound, along with the shape that gives the optimal                             
              result.  The research is expected to yield substantial                         
              contributions to the general area of eigenvalue bounds                         
              for differential operators.  The u.S. side will gain                           
              from continued collaboration with a Chilean expert in                          
              this area.  The Chilean side will benefit from                                 
              continued direct participation with a U.S.                                     
              counterpart.
