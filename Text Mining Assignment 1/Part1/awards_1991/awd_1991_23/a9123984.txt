Abstract    :
                   This award will enable a team of United States (US) academic              
              researchers in the area of Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM)             
              to visit sites in Europe where such research effort is being                   
              conducted under the sponsorship of the European Strategic Programme            
              for Research and Development in Information Technology (ESPRIT).               
              Up to nine members will spend 8-10 days visiting the selected sites            
              and compiling a report that describes the activities and recommends            
              potential for US/ESPRIT collaboration.                                         
                   Such activity in CIM, which is the future of all                          
              manufacturing,  will expose US researchers to the successful                   
              efforts of their European counterparts and define avenues for                  
              future collaboration.  This will have a significant impact on the              
              domestic research in CIM with potential benefits to the nation's               
              industry.
