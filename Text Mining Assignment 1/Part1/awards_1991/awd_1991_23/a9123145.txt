Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a project designed to provide a high              
              resolution record of late Wisconsin climatic events in central                 
              Alaska.  The objectives of the study are:  1) to recover, analyze              
              and date sediment cores from Wonder Lake, and 2) to use the dated              
              lake record to interpret alate Wisconsin/Holocene climatic change.             
              The results of this research will have broad implications to the               
              nature and timing of rapid/abrupt climatic events during the late              
              Wisconsin in central Alaska.
