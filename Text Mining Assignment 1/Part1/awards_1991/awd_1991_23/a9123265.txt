Abstract    :
                   This project continues mathematical research on questions                 
              related to ordinary and partial differential equations.  The                   
              research considers properties of solutions obtained by combining               
              global topological techniques with analytic tools. Work on                     
              ordinary differential equations focuses on systems, called                     
              Hamiltonian systems, which serve as models for the motion of                   
              finite systems of particles.  Since the 1970's there has been                  
              considerable progress in the study of periodic solutions of                    
              Hamiltonian systems through newly developed techniques growing                 
              out of the calculus of variations.  Current research will use                  
              past work in analyzing other types of global solutions (the                    
              periodic ones are the simplest, but there are others).  The                    
              solution paths, often called orbits, are much more difficult to                
              treat because of the loss of boundedness.  Still, there is some                
              promising preliminary work which can be pursued further.                       
                   There are analogous questions which can be raised for                     
              semilinear elliptic partial differential equations.  Earlier                   
              research has led to the existence of solutions which do not                    
              change sign.  Although there is considerable literature on the                 
              subject now, the results say little about the nature of the                    
              solutions (e.g. how can one describe the rise and fall of                      
              solution surfaces?).  Work will be done on questions of this                   
              nature.
