Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Christopher Clark of                             
              Cornell University and a graduate student to                                   
              collaborate with two groups of European biologists in                          
              a study of songbird communication.  Professor Clark                            
              has developed a passive acoustic system for locating                           
              vocalizing animals using an array of microphones.  The                         
              system computes the locations of individual birds                              
              which are vocalizing anywhere within 200 meters of the                         
              center of the array.  This technique allows him to                             
              simultaneously follow the movements and acoustic                               
              behaviors of many different birds within a community                           
              and study the details of their vocal interactions.  He                         
              will apply this system to two well marked and studied                          
              populations of European birds through field work in                            
              England with Dr. Peter McGregor of the University of                           
              Nottingham and in Denmark with Dr. Torben Dabelsteen                           
              from the University of Copenhagen.  These                                      
              collaborators have marked populations of blackbirds                            
              and other species, and have pioneered interactive                              
              playback systems that are biologically meaningful.                             
                                                                                             
              Bird song and singing behavior among territorial birds                         
              are very complex and poorly understood phenomena.                              
              This research plan introduces innovative techniques                            
              that will help surmount technical problems associated                          
              with studying communication networks.  The results                             
              should be significant new information about how                                
              animals communicate with their vocalizations.
