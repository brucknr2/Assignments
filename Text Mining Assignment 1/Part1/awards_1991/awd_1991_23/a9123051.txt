Abstract    :
              This project will supply shipboard scientific equipment for the                
              research vessels MELVILLE, WASHINGTON, NEW HORIZON, and R. G.                  
              SPROUL, operated by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and               
              dedicated to use in support of ocean science research.                         
                                                                                             
              The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds              
              for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                     
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support               
              for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the               
              deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational               
              equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                       
              receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                         
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and                       
              satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                           
              communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                 
              for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                  
                                                                                             
              The Project Director, George G. Shor is fully qualified to direct              
              this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the              
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.                           
                                                                                             
              This project will allow the institution to upgrade safety-related              
              equipment on the MELVILLE. NEW HORIZON and SPROUL, improve                     
              navigational equipment on the MELVILLE, replace a search light                 
              and reduce electrical spikes on the NEW HORIZON, fabricate and                 
              outfit a portable air compressor van for general use and replace               
              outboard motors on the MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON and SPROUL.
