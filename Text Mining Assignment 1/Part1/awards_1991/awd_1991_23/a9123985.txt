Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The CONCERT Network (COmmunications for North Carolina Education,              
              Research, and Technology) is a mid-level network that serves the               
              State of North Carolina.  CONCERT is connected directly to the                 
              NSFNET Backbone Network.  It is the intention of CONCERT to offer              
              NSFNET connections to all higher education institutions in North               
              Carolina.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests support to establish nine new connections               
              for: Campbell University, Catawba College, Chowan College, Elon                
              College, Lees-McRae College, Meredith College, Mount Olive                     
              College, Queens College, and Shaw University.                                  
                                                                                             
              A primary goal of CONCERT is to facilitate collaborative projects              
              and sharing of resources between instutuion, including those                   
              outside the state.  CONCERT will provide operations management                 
              and information services as well as provide appropriate dedicated              
              connections to the nine institutions.                                          
                                                                                             
              The universities need greater functionality and network speed to               
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore                   
              innovative educational resources.***//
