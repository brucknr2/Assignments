Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor L. Teirlinck                
              to work in combinatorics.  He intends to work on the large sets                
              of disjoint designs and related structures.  In particular, he                 
              intends to continue his research on t-designs.                                 
                   The research crosses lines between the areas of                           
              combinatorics, and coding theory.  Combinatorics attempts to find              
              efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects                 
              can be organized.  And, so it is extremely important to modern                 
              communications, for example the design of large networks as in                 
              telephone systems.  The main object to be studied in the proposed              
              research, t-designs are a fundamental tool used in the                         
              foundations of authenticity theory in cryptography.
