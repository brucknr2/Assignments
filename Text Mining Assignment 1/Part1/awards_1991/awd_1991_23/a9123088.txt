Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a two year study to test a preliminary            
              magnetostratigraphic correlation which was developed for Strand                
              Fjord, Axel Heiberg Island, Northwest Territories, Canada.  In                 
              addition to extending the section to younger (Eocene) and older                
              (Campanian-Maastrichtian) sediments, an in-depth lithostratigraphic            
              and magnetostratigraphic study will be made of a laminated lagoonal            
              sequence at Strand Fiord.  This sequence affords a nearly unique               
              opportunity to obtain a Late Cretaceous polar paleoclimate record              
              of annual variability that also extends into the Milankovitch                  
              frequency band.
