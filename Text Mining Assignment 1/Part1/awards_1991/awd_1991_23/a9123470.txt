Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is to provide travel support for the U.S. speakers at             
              the International Workshop on Technology for Hong Kong's                       
              Infrastructure Development.  The primary objective of this Workshop            
              is to bring together international talents to address areas of                 
              research relevant to technology for infrastructure development and             
              maintenance.  There will be a particular emphasis on Port and                  
              Airport Development Strategy in Hong Kong, which is one of the                 
              largest civil engineering projects ever attempted.                             
                                                                                             
              The workshop will include four subject areas:  Building Engineering            
              (focussing on active structural control techniques to mitigate                 
              building response under dynamic environment (;Bridge Engineering               
              (damage assessment and dynamic response of suspension and                      
              cablestayed bridges); Costal Engineering (effect of storm surges               
              and typhoons on harbors and bays and new protection alternatives)              
              and Geotechnical Engineering (progress in marine applications,                 
              harbor landfill projects and stability of slopes).
