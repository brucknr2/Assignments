Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This work will characterize the variation of magnetization of             
              near-axis crustal rocks obtained by dredge and rock drill from the             
              East Pacific Rise at 13 degrees north. In addition to the rock                 
              magnetic studies of the returned samples, magnetometer and gravity             
              data collected over the sample sites will be analyzed. The                     
              combination of the rock magnetic data from the samples, with the               
              sea surface magnetic and gravity data, and the further integration             
              with the funded geochemical analyses, will allow the identification            
              of sources of variation in near-axis crustal magnetization.
