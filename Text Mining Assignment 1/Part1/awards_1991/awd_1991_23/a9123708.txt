Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  When examined over long periods of time, counts of the number             
              of organizations in diverse populations initially grow slowly, then            
              grow rapidly for a short time, peak, then decline and stabilize                
              (and often eventually decline).  This project continues a line of              
              research that seeks to explain this pattern by means of developing             
              a set of mathematical models based on a sociological theory of                 
              density-dependent evolution, that is, the pattern of the birth,                
              growth, decline, and mortality of organizations as a function of               
              the number of organizations in a population.  Among the new issues             
              that are being confronted by this project are the disentanglement              
              of the effects of age versus size of organizations and of density              
              versus mass of populations and the application of density theory               
              to the community level as well as to individual populations.  Data             
              will be collected on populations and communities of financial                  
              institutions and newspaper publishing firms to examine these issues            
              empirically.                                                                   
                                                                                             
                   This project will not only contribute to our understanding of             
              the forces shaping organizational structures over long time spans,             
              but also it will contribute to the provision of a theoretical                  
              structure for explaining how organizational change produces changes            
              in society.
