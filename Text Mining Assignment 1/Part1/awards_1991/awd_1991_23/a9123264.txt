Abstract    :
                   This action will provide funds for continued support for                  
              research in elementary particle physics.  Three faculty, two                   
              research associates and three graduate students will continue                  
              their investigations of particle interactions at Fermilab.                     
              There they will collaborate in the operation of a particle                     
              detector just coming into operation (the D0 detector).  They                   
              will study phenomena associated with proton-antiproton                         
              collisions at the highest laboratory energies currently                        
              available.  Among their collaborators is a large number of other               
              investigators supported with National Science Foundation funds.                
              The research will contribute to our understanding of the                       
              "standard model" of elementary particles, its  and perhaps its                 
              limitations and domain of completeness.
