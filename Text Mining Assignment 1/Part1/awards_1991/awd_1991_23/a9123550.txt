Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports U.S.-Belgium cooperative research in                       
              systematic biology between Ariena H.C. van Bruggen of the                      
              University of California at Davis and Monique Gillis of Ryks                   
              University in Gent, Belgium.  The objective of their research is to            
              investigate the taxonomy of the genus Rhizomonas and recently                  
              isolated Rhizomonas-like bacteria.  The investigators will determine           
              the relationships among soil borne bacteria closely related to                 
              Rhizomonas and classify the different groups found within                      
              Rhizomonas.  They will use modern methods of DNA and RNA                       
              sequencing, hybridization studies in developing data for                       
              classification of the groups.  The U.S. group brings to this                   
              collaboration their expertise in rDNA sequencing.  This is                     
              complemented by the Gent's group expertise in DNA and RNA                      
              hybridization and their extensive data base on bacterial genera.               
                                                                                             
              The taxonomy and relationships among groups of soil-borne                      
              bacteria have not been studied widely despite their possible use for           
              biological control of plant pathogens and  Further classification will         
              provide scientists with a means for differentiating among useful and           
              harmful bacteria. The project will provide new data on rRNA                    
              methods system that could be applied to the classification of the              
              majority of bacteria.
