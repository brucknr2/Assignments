Abstract    :
                   This research examines sharp risk convergence for adaptive                
              estimates of nonparametric curves in the absence of prior                      
              information on nuisance parameters.Since optimal risk convergence              
              in this context depends crucially on the smoothness of the                     
              estimated curve, the goal is to develop a suitable estimator                   
              without a priori knowledge of the smoothness.  Particular areas                
              of application are probability density estimation, nonparametric               
              regression, filtering and spectral density estimation.                         
                   Most (optimal) estimates of curves from data rely on                      
              assumptions about the smoothness of the curve to be estimated.                 
              Adaptive estimation allows information about the smoothness to be              
              built up as observations (data) are gathered.  This is done at                 
              the same time and as part of the process of estimating the curve               
              itself.  For sequential methods of this kind, the amount of data               
              required (sample size) depends on the observations and the                     
              underlying curve.  Both theoretical approaches to an optimal                   
              overall strategy and some applications will be considered.
