Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator together with the co-principal                 
              investigators will carry out research on the development of                    
              scientific computing, asymptotics and their application to fluid               
              mechanics and wave propagation.                                                
                   The analysis of nonlinear fluid dynamics is of significant                
              scientific interest in view of the wide spread occurrence of such              
              phenomena in real world situations.
