Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study diffusion subject to                
              the specification of mass, a number of free boundary value                     
              problems related to combustion of solid fuels, and will analyze                
              a number of nonclassical inverse problems.  The qualitative                    
              analysis of the solutions of such problems is of significant                   
              scientific interest in view of the wide spread application of                  
              such problems to physical systems.                                             
                   Parabolic partial differential equations are useful as                    
              mathematical models in many areas of engineering, chemistry, and               
              physics.  By better understanding the fundamental theory of                    
              nonstandard models of flows, better numerical predictions of real              
              flows will result.
