Abstract    :
              The development of new and synthetically useful reactions based                
              upon cation radical catalysis is planned.  The advantages and                  
              attributes of these new reactions will be investigated by means                
              of thorough study of their selectivity profiles and mechanisms.                
              Extremely sensitive mechanistic probes for the cation radical                  
              intermediates involved in catalyzed reactions have been                        
              designed and will be further quantitated and perfected.  These                 
              probes will permit the definitive detection of these catalytic                 
              mechanisms, in general, where these are operative.  The full                   
              scope of this powerful, new catalytic principle can thus be                    
              defined.  The involvement of a catalytic mechanism in                          
              biological and enzyme model catalyzed epoxidation will be                      
              examined using these probes.  The involvement of radical cation                
              catalysis in, or its relationship to other biological oxidation                
              reactions will also be examined.                                               
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will continue to                
              support the research of Dr. Nathan L. Bauld at the University                  
              of Texas.  The research explores new ramifications and                         
              applications of the chemistry of cation radicals.  It will                     
              generate new methodology that should benefit research in                       
              biochemistry and medicine as well as in the chemical industry.
