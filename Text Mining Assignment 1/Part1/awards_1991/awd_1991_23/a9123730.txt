Abstract    :
               The strategic goal of this research is to contribute to the  development of a
              comprehensive theory of computational  complexity.  Computational complexity is
              the study of the  quantitative laws that govern computation and it is an 
              essential part of the science base needed to guide, harness  and exploit the
              explosively growing computer technology.  The proposed research has two main
              goals:  a) to understand  better what makes problems hard to compute and to
              develop  techniques to verify the degree of hardness, b) to explore  what is
              the best that can be done with computational resources  not sufficient to solve
              a problem.  Computational complexity classifies problems by the amounts of 
              various computational resources needed to solve them.  This  classification
              yields complexity classes that consist of all  problems that can be solved
              within a given computational  resource bound.  To gain a deeper understanding
              of what makes  problems hard to compute, the project explores various  
              complexity classes, relations between these classes  and the internal structure
              of these classes.  It also  explores the trade-offs between different
              computational  resources in problem solving, with particular attention to 
              sequential-time, parallel-time, nondeterministic-time, memory  requirements,
              randomness as a computational resource and  interactive computing.
