Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the ethnographic research of a graduate                  
              student from Harvard University in a rural area of China.  The                 
              student will interview community members about their notions of                
              history.  The focus will not be on the accuracy of popular                     
              memory, but rather on the social processes that select and create              
              memory out of the available material. Using participant                        
              observation and in depth interviews the student (a Chinese native              
              fluent in the local language) will systematically collect images               
              and knowledge of the distant and recent past, analyzing how                    
              individual rationalizations of past behavior have a moral and                  
              social basis.  The local community is an apt place to do the                   
              research since it was relocated in 1958, and thus has a specific               
              event of collective suffering to deal with.                                    
                                                                                             
              This research is important because local communities have long                 
              memories which are often used to justify current action.                       
              Understanding of the social processes which shape these memories               
              can help us understand and deal with current political and social              
              behavior in similar villages.
