Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the generation and                               
              characterization of antibodies which will catalyze the Oxy-Cope                
              rearrangement, amide hydrolysis and macrolactonization.  The                   
              work centers on hapten design and relies on Dr. Masamune's                     
              experience in synthetic organic chemistry.

              With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Saturo Masamune of the                          
              Department of Chemistry of the Massachusetts Institute of                      
              Technology.  Professor Masamune will focus his work on the                     
              synthesis of molecules called haptens that are capable of                      
              raising antibodies.  The antibodies, in turn, are catalysts for                
              a number of important synthetic organic reactions.
