Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study the singularities in                
              low dimensional non-linear real analytic partial differential                  
              equations. A key feature of his approach will be the use of                    
              multivalued solutions and a geometric approach to the study of                 
              singularities. A general objective of the research will be to                  
              identify geometric invariants of partial differential equations                
              which control singularities of solutions.                                      
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
