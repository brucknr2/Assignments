Abstract    :
                   The variability of the mean-flow of the equatorial middle                 
              atmosphere is dominated by the quasi-biennial and semiannual                   
              oscillations (QBO and SAO).  Dr. Dunkerton will continue his                   
              investigation of the dynamics of these oscillations, emphasizing               
              the theory of nonlinear mean meridional circulations in the middle             
              atmosphere, their effect on the east and west phases of SAO and                
              QBO, the effect of localized aerosol heating in the tropics (e.g.,             
              the circulation changes which result from volcanic eruptions like              
              Mt. Pinatubo) and mechanisms of coupling the QBO to the high-                  
              latitude polar vortex.  The stability of equatorial Rossby-wave                
              critical layers will be investigated, focussing on the role of                 
              equatorial inertial instabilities on a nonparallel basic state                 
              distorted by Rossby waves from midlatitudes.  Excitation and                   
              propagation of equatorial waves in the tropical troposphere will               
              also be addressed.                                                             
                   This research is important not only for basic understanding of            
              the structure and dynamics of the middle atmosphere, but also for              
              understanding short-term climate variability.
