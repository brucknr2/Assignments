Abstract    :
                   This award is concerned with work in finite group theory.                 
              The principal investigator is interested in those groups, such as              
              solvable groups and certain related families, which have an ample              
              supply of normal subgroups.  The primary concern is with the                   
              character theory of these groups.  In particular, he will                      
              investigate the interactions between certain characters of a                   
              group, characters of particular subgroups and sets of prime                    
              numbers.  He will also continue to work on questions related to                
              the theory of M-groups.                                                        
                   A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation.                
              It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and               
              chemistry.  The fundamental building blocks of finite groups are               
              finite simple groups.  One of the major results in mathematics of              
              the past decade is the classification of the finite simple                     
              groups, the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal              
              pages.  This research is aimed at using this classification in                 
              the study of arbitrary finite groups.
