Abstract    :
              This award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the                    
              Chemistry Division under the Materials Synthesis and Processing                
              Initiative. The research will explore the range of ligand                      
              intermediates that may be formed in thin film depositions of                   
              binary early transition metal oxides, sulfides and nitrides.                   
              Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) routes to thin films will be                   
              developed using volatile metal halides and organic oxygen,                     
              nitrogen and sulphur compounds. The coordination chemistry of                  
              titanium, zirconium and hafnium tetrachlorides with alcohols,                  
              amines and thiols will be investigated to gain a deeper                        
              understanding of the types of ligand ensembles that may be                     
              produced in film-forming processes.  Complexes will be prepared                
              in both solution phase and gas phase reactions in order to                     
              understand the relationship between these potentially divergent                
              processes.  All stable complexes will be evaluated as CVD                      
              precursors. A mechanistic sequence for each material that leads                
              from starting materials to the thin film will be developed.                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Thin ceramic films made by CVD processes are of growing                        
              technological importance.  The range of ligand intermediates                   
              that can be supported at a metal will illustrate broad                         
              principles of CVD that can be applied to other film depositions                
              and greatly enhance chemical predictability.
