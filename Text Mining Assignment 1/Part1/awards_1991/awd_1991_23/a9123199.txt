Abstract    :
                   Dimension scaling is used to study correlation effects in                 
              few electron systems.  The molecular collective motions appear                 
              in a natural way at low order perturbation theory and                          
              quantitative energies at higher orders.  The work extends the                  
              approach to excited and autoionizing states of two electron                    
              systems and begins the exploration of higher symmetries,                       
              interdimensional degeneracies and geometries in these systems.
