Abstract    :
                        The investigator will continue his research on the                   
              quantum invariants of 3-manifolds, first defined by Witten (in the             
              context of quantum field theory) and by Reshetikhin and Turaev (in             
              the context of quantum groups).  The overall objectives of the                 
              project are:                                                                   
              1) to study the structure of the known quantum invariants and their            
              refinements, and to explore possible generalizations;                          
              2) to study connections between quantum invariants and other 3-                
              manifold invariants;                                                           
              3) to explore the relationship of quantum invariants with number               
              theory;                                                                        
              4) to apply quantum invariants to problems in low dimensional                  
              topology.                                                                      
                   There is a long tradition of mathematicians involving                     
              themselves in the problems of physics, often to the mutual                     
              enrichment of both subjects.  Tools are developed to solve physical            
              problems and then turn out to have much greater generality and                 
              become widely used in mathematics.  The story of the new quantum               
              invariants of 3-manifolds is similar.  Mathematicians interesting              
              themselves in problems of quantum field theory were led to a                   
              certain geometric construction.  The construction led in turn to an            
              invariant that depended only on the topological character and not              
              the full geometric character of the underlying manifold.  There are            
              now variations on the original construction and numerous resulting             
              quantum invariants.  Their origin is sufficiently different from               
              that of other previously known invariants that they can be expected            
              to detect things the traditional invariants cannot.  It now                    
              behooves topologists to demonstrate this as well as to sort out the            
              different quantum invariants and their relationships to more                   
              traditional invariants.
