Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports Professor Rosemary Renaut of Arizona                       
              State University to collaborate in mathematics research                        
              with Professor Rolf Jeltsch of the Applied Mathematics                         
              Group of the Swiss Federal Institute (ETH), Zurich.                            
              They are studying the stability of certain numerical                           
              algorithms for solving hyperbolic differential                                 
              equations.  Typically, numerical solutions to these                            
              differential equations can be found by a variety of                            
              methods such as finite elements, spectral methods and                          
              finite difference methods.  In this proposal finite                            
              difference methods are emphasized.                                             
                                                                                             
              Realistic solutions of hyperbolic initial boundary value                       
              problems are required in many areas including                                  
              computational fluid mechanics, geophysics and                                  
              aerodynamics.  A complete geometric description of the                         
              order star of Riemann surfaces will provide insight into                       
              the stability and accuracy of numerical algorithms to                          
              solve these problems.  Both researchers have been active                       
              in the numerical solution of hyperbolic equations; Dr.                         
              Renaut's work has been mainly concentrated on the wave                         
              equation, while Dr. Jeltsch has worked on the advection                        
              equation.  Many other problems will benefit from a                             
              deeper understanding of these numerical algorithms.
