Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Cristina Amon of Carnegie Mellon                 
              University (CMU) to collaborate in mechanical engineering                      
              research with Professor F. Mayinger of the Institute for                       
              Thermodynamics of the Technical University of Munich, Germany.                 
              The objective of their research is to quantify and gain a                      
              better understanding of the physics of heat transfer                           
              enhancement in supercritical, self-sustained, oscillatory                      
              flows, such as those found in compact heat exchangers for                      
              cooling electronic systems.  The numerical and analytical part                 
              of their joint research will be developed at CMU under the                     
              direction of Professor Amon.  The experimental part of the                     
              research will be conducted at the Technical University of                      
              Munich by Professor Mayinger and others, using real-time                       
              holographic interferometry and high-speed cinematography.                      
                                                                                             
              Heat transfer plays an important role in the reliability and                   
              efficiency of a great many mechanical and electronic systems.                  
              Optimizing such transfer is being given more and more attention                
              in the design of systems needing compact heat exchange                         
              surfaces.  These include many applications in energy-related                   
              devices, electronic cooling, cryogenics and aerospace                          
              applications.  The proposed cooperative research will develop                  
              and validate a mathematical model of heat transfer enhancement.
