Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports Professor Paul Goodey of the                               
              University of Oklahoma to collaborate with Professor                           
              Wolfgang Weil of the Mathematics Institute of the                              
              University of Karlsruhe, Germany.  Their collaboration                         
              focusses on problems which frequently have a three-                            
              dimensional motivation and involve the reconstruction of                       
              sets from knowledge of their cross sections or                                 
              projections into other sets.  Professor Goodey brings to                       
              the collaboration particular expertise in convexity and                        
              stereology while Professor Weil has made substantial                           
              contributions in stochastic geometry.                                          
                                                                                             
              The specific research problems to be discussed involve                         
              interactions between convex geometry and the Radon                             
              transform, and questions regarding translative integral                        
              geometry and stochastic geometry.  These problems can                          
              lead to various applications in mathematics as well as                         
              engineering, biology and medicine.  U.S. mathematics                           
              will benefit from exposure to significant research                             
              directions in Europe in this area, which has been                              
              dominated by Europeans.  The research proposed here                            
              includes important and difficult state-of-the-art                              
              problems and links two outstanding mathematicians who                          
              are contributing fundamental advances through their                            
              approach.
