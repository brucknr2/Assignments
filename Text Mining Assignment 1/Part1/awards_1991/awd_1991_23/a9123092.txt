Abstract    :
              This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment                
              for the research vessel PELICAN operated by the Louisiana                      
              Universities Marine Center on behalf of the Louisiana                          
              Universities Marine Consortium and dedicated to use in support of              
              ocean science research.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds              
              for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                     
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support               
              for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the               
              deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational               
              equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                       
              receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                         
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and                       
              satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                           
              communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                 
              for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                  
                                                                                             
              The Project Director, Steve Rabalais is fully qualified to direct              
              this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the              
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.                           
                                                                                             
              This project will allow the institution to acquire an air                      
              compressor for its seawater system, computers for logging data,                
              emergency breathing devices for safety and a new barometer.
