Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the dynamics of matrix                    
              differential equations and their applications.  The equations are              
              cast in a fairly general framework, generalizing special                       
              instances found in some important numerical algorithms.  The                   
              dynamics of each matrix differential equation will be explored                 
              via computer experiments, high resolution graphics and symbolic                
              manipulations, in conjunction with analysis.  The objective is to              
              better understand the dynamics of matrix differential equations,               
              and to study the closely related questions regarding the                       
              eigenvalues and singular values of specially structured matrices.              
                   This study is expected to find important applications                     
              ranging from development of novel computational algorithms to                  
              theoretic solutions of new problems in differential equations and              
              linear algebra.
