Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will work on a number of problems              
              in abstract gambling theory, which is a particular formulation of              
              stochastic control, and on related problems in the theory of two-              
              person, zero-sum stochastic games.  Some of the research will                  
              treat fundamental questions about the optimal reward function in               
              gambling and the value function in stochastic games.  One of                   
              these questions for a general class of stochastic games is the                 
              existence of the value.  Some of the research will also treat                  
              specific stochastic control problems and stochastic games.                     
              Finally research is also proposed on certain questions which                   
              arise in the theory of Bayesian statistics.                                    
                   The principal investigator will work on fundamental                       
              questions about optimal decision making through time in the                    
              presence of uncertainty.  Abstract gambling theory treats                      
              problems in which a single decision maker needs to control a                   
              process so as to attain some well-defined objective.  In                       
              stochastic games two players have opposing interests and each                  
              seeks to control the same process but toward opposite ends.  The               
              mathematical details of such problems can be highly technical,                 
              but solutions are of interest in many areas including economics,               
              operations research, and finance.
