Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                 
              of Professor Steven Bachrach at Northern Illinois University.                  
              Professor Bachrach will use molecular orbital calculations and                 
              a topological electron density analysis in order to examine                    
              organic reaction mechanisms.  A series of electrocyclic                        
              reactions involving phosphaalkenes and phosphaalkynes and                      
              nucleophilic substitution reactions at heteroatoms will be                     
              examined.  These studies will test the concept of the                          
              transferability of mechanism type from element to element and                  
              will offer assistance in the modification of reactants to                      
              facilitate these reactions.                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Calculations will be utilized to determine the energy content                  
              and the electron distribution of the highest energy point                      
              between the starting material and product in reactions                         
              involving organic compounds containing phosphorus, oxygen,                     
              nitrogen, or sulfur.  The reactions chosen for study represent                 
              an important class of reactions and will assist the developing                 
              synthetic work in this area.
