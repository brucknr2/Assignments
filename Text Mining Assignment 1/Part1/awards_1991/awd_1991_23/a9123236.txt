Abstract    :
              This project will supply shipboard scientific equipment for the                
              research vessels COLUMBUS ISELIN and CALANUS, operated by the                  
              University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric               
              Science, and dedicated to use in support of ocean science                      
              research.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds              
              for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                     
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support               
              for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the               
              deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational               
              equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                       
              receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                         
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and                       
              satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                           
              communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                 
              for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                  
                                                                                             
              The Project Director, Ronald Hutchinson is fully qualified to                  
              direct this project having had considerable experience in                      
              overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard                       
              equipment.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project will allow the institution to acquire a video system              
              to monitor deck activities on the ISELIN, improve winch metering               
              on the trawl and hydro winches on the ISELIN, replace two                      
              outboard motors for the ISELIN and CALANUS and obtain a clean                  
              hood for the ISELIN.
