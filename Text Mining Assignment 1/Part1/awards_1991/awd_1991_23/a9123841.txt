Abstract    :
                   Rodman intends to study a variety of interrelated problems                
              in operator theory and matrix analysis.  These include                         
              interpolation problems for matrix and operator valued functions,               
              completions of matrices and operators, linear preservers, several              
              aspects of perturbation theory, and spectrum assignment problems.              
                                                                                             
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
