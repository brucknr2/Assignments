Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The heat transfer characteristics of the evaporating extended                  
              meniscus will be measured.  The contact line region, which is                  
              critically important to many technologies, will be emphasized.                 
              This complicated non-equilibrium system has only been                          
              rudimentarily studied.  Therefore, a systematic study of the                   
              effects of the liquid-solid-vapor intermolecular force field,                  
              as described by a new dimensionless parameter, and the size of                 
              the system on the stress, the heat transfer characteristics                    
              and the stability will be function of the thickness profile,                   
              will be measured using microcomputer enhanced video microscopy                 
              based on ellipsometry and interferometry.  The data will be                    
              analyzed using the numerical solution of a model equation                      
              which will then be used to obtain the transport                                
              characteristics.  The temperature field will be measured using                 
              the interline absorbed film thickness and small temperature                    
              sensors.
