Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Financial support is requested to bring three to four young               
              scientists from Eastern Europe ($4,800) and a selected number of               
              ($1,700) to the GRC scheduled for July 20-24, 1992.  The chief aim             
              is to identify future scientific leaders in high-temperature                   
              chemistry and provide a medium for their interaction with approxi-             
              mately 125 scientists from academic, industrial, and government                
              laboratories.  Participants will discuss fundamental thermodynamic             
              properties of refractory materials, stability and structure of                 
              molecules at high temperature, theory of the relation of structure             
              to the properties, etc.  These topics are important in material                
              design and processing, energy conversions, and microelectronics.
