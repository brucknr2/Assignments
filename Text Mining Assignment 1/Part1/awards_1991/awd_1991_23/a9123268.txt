Abstract    :
                 Partial support is requested for an American Society for Cell               
              Biology Summer Conference on "Molecular Mechanisms of Membrane                 
              Traffic," to be held May 10-13, 1992 at the Airlie House near                  
              Warrenton, VA.  Support for the participation of European                      
              scientists has already been obtained from NATO.                                
                                                                                             
              Molecules involved in the individual steps of membrane traffic are             
              being identified and their functions defined at an amazingly rapid             
              rate.  This conference will concentrate on the membrane transport              
              steps where molecular detail is available, and draw from data                  
              obtained in plant, yeast, and mammalian systems.  The membrane                 
              traffic field is expanding and fewer students and postdoctoral                 
              fellows are selected for participation at the major, limited-                  
              attendance meetings, such as Gordon Research Conferences.                      
              Communication between young scientists and leaders in the field is             
              an essential element of training; therefore, this conference will              
              focus on providing these interactions for students and postdoctoral            
              fellows.  The meeting will accommodate 150 scientists and is                   
              designed to encourage maximal interaction among participants.  This            
              award will provide scholarships for young and minority scientists              
              to attend the meeting.
