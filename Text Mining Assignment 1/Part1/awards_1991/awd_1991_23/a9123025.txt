Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a two year program to study the air-              
              snow exchange processes controlling the uptake, release, and                   
              incorporation of reactive gases into polar firn.  The                          
              concentrations of two reactive species, hydrogen peroxide and                  
              formaldehyde, in air above and below the snow surface, will be                 
              measured and the equilibria and kinetics of the absorption,                    
              and release of these gases at the ice-air interface will be                    
              studied.  A mathematical model to describe gas-snow interactions               
              will be developed, calibrated and validated using field data                   
              obtained at Summit, Greenland.
