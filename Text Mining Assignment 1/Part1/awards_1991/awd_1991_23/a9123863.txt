Abstract    :
              Chapman Conference on Micro and Meso Scale Phenomena in Space                  
              Physics                                                                        
                  Funds are requested to support the attendance of graduate                  
              students and recent doctorate candidates at the AGU Chapman                    
              Conference on Micro and Meso Scale Phenomena in Space Plasmas.                 
              Chapman Conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the American             
              Geophysical Union (AGU) and are designed to promote opportunities              
              not normally available through the format of larger meetings.  The             
              unifying theme for this conference is the interface between micro              
              and meso scale processes and associated theory and modeling.  This             
              unifying theme is very important to magnetospheric physics                     
              generally as illustrated in the prime example of MHD fluid models              
              for plasma reconnection (then treating meso-scale processes in                 
              boundary layers) vs. kinetic, wave-particle interaction physics                
              needed to quantitatively treat the anomalous dissipation required              
              by most reconnection models (the micro process).  The proceedings              
              will encompass stochastic and quasilinear processes and nonlinear              
              wave-particle interactions occurring in fluctuating,                           
              nonequilibrium, collisionless, collisional and turbulent space                 
              plasmas.  The conference will help to assur that the upcoming                  
              generation of space physicists will be well versed in this complex,            
              yet vital area of space physics.
