Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for a project, the                         
              objective of which is to devise and verify mathematical                        
              models that characterize the removal of soluble manganese                      
              from natural water by filter media that have become coated                     
              with oxides of manganese.  The mathematical models to be                       
              devised will be based upon fundamental principles of                           
              surface chemistry and mass transfer.  Model parameters                         
              will be experimentally evaluated at laboratory-scale, and                      
              the models verified by conduct of field-scale research at                      
              the City of Durham, North Carolina's Williams Water                            
              Treatment Plant and at the Blacksburg-Christiansburg-                          
              Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Water                      
              Treatment Plant.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Results of this project are expected to provide a more                         
              fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which                           
              manganese in solution is removed from water by contact                         
              with filter media coated with the contaminant's oxide.                         
              This knowledge may be applied to improving the engineering                     
              design of water treatment processes for removal of soluble                     
              manganese.
