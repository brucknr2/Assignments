Abstract    :
              The high brightness positron beam at Brandeis University is being              
              used to perform low energy positron diffraction (LEPD) and positron            
              reemission microscope (PRM) experiments.  The LEPD technique can               
              provide a more precise structural determination of compound                    
              semiconductor surfaces than its electron counterpart, low energy               
              electron diffraction (LEED).  The proposed experiments are designed            
              to extend the present 80 nm spatial resolution to 1nm.  Compound               
              semiconductors and metal surfaces will be investigated.  The PRM               
              will produce up to 50,000x magnified image of positrons reemitted              
              at low energies from a thin Ni(100) film.  The extreme sensitivity             
              and nondestructiveness of low energy positrons to subsurface                   
              defects and overlying atoms will be used for imaging features, such            
              as monovacancies an interfacial defects in submonolayer metal film             
              growth, that can not be seen with conventional electron microscopy.
