Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award is in support of one element of the project:                   
              Paleoclimates from Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE).  The study of            
              pollen in sedimentary deposits has been one of the primary sources             
              of information on continental paleoenvironments and will                       
              undoubtedly be one of the predominant proxy climate indicators in              
              the reconstruction of Arctic paleoenvironmental conditions.  This              
              project will refine and further test techniques for the extraction             
              of pollen from sedimentary deposits for dating by radiocarbon                  
              accelerator mass spectrometry.  These extraction techniques have               
              recently been shown to be effective in isolating pollen from                   
              contaminants that are probably responsible for significant                     
              inconsistencies and uncertainties in sediment dates obtained by the            
              traditional method of 14C radioactive decay dating of bulk sediment            
              samples.  The development of improved pollen extraction and                    
              radiocarbon dating techniques will greatly facilitate the                      
              preparation and dating of samples of interest to the general                   
              palynology and paleoecology research communities.
