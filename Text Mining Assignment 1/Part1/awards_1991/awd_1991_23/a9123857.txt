Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Properties of materials are studied in the microkelvin to                      
              millikelvin regime.  The properties of 3He confined in porous                  
              materials and in mixtures with 4He are investigated.  Internal                 
              friction in silicon as well as new techniques in refrigeration and             
              thermometry are tested.
