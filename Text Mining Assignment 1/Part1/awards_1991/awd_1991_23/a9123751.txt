Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the understanding ofMo-mediated                  
              allylic amination reactions.  Specific objectives include                      
              development of efficient Mo-catalyzed allylic amination                        
              reactions of alkenes by hydroxylamine derivatives;                             
              determination of the scope, regio- and stereoselectivity of                    
              these reactions; development of double amination variants;                     
              evaluation of the feasibility of alpha-aminating a variety of                  
              unsaturated substrates; assessment of LW(O)(RNO and                            
              Cp2NbR'(RNO) complexes as alkene aminating agents; and                         
              elucidation of the mechanismn of these types of reactions.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. Kenneth M. Nicholas of the Department of                   
              Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma.  Professor Nicholas                   
              will focus his work on the development of new reactions that                   
              functionalize hydrocarbons by the direct introduction of                       
              nitrogen based groups using Mo-promoted allylic amination.
