Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project supports participation of a U.S. team               
              of computer scientists and engineers in a Indo-U.S. workshop on                
              "Cooperative Research in Computer Science" to be held in                       
              Bangalore, India, August 4 to 6, 1992.  The areas of expertise to              
              be represented include: robotics and computer vision, computer                 
              systems and networking, software engineering, and artificial                   
              intelligence.  The objectives of the workshop are to:  present                 
              papers by U.S. and Indian participants about the recent advances               
              in the various topical areas, identify research needs in each of               
              these areas, identify suitable areas for Indo-U.S. collaborative               
              research, and establish firm collaborations between U.S. and                   
              Indian scientists.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This is the second Indo-U.S. workshop in the area of                   
              computer science.  The first was held in 1989 in the city of                   
              Hyderabad, India with participation from India's main                          
              governmental and private research organizations with interest in               
              computer research and applications.  Since that time a number of               
              collaborative activities have resulted.  The present project is                
              designed to continue and intensify this mutually beneficial                    
              interaction and collaboration.  The project meets the objectives               
              of the U.S.-India Cooperative Science Program.
