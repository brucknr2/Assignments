Abstract    :
                   Professor Galvez performs experiments investigating the                   
              optical phenomenon of superfluorescence.  Superfluorescence is a               
              collective effect in which an ensemble of particles emit                       
              stimulated, coherent radiation.  Although this effect has been                 
              known for some time, it has been difficult to observe in a                     
              fundamental form.  Galvez and his group will carry out                         
              measurements of superfluorescence in the small sample (Dicke)                  
              regime, and in a high field regime where superfluorescence may be              
              destroyed by dynamical chaos.
