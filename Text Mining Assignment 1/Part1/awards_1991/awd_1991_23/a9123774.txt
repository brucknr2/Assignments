Abstract    :
              This research enables an economist and a philosopher to examine a              
              key issue of equity linked to global climate change.  What do                  
              people living now owe to future generations?  This project will                
              analyze these issues from two perspectives.  There will be a                   
              philosophical analysis of obligations to future generations and                
              to preserve the environment.  There will be an economic analysis               
              of the impact of various distributive policies.  Findings from                 
              both perspectives will be applied to models of climate change.                 
              The research is intended to deepen our understanding of concepts               
              of intergenerational equity, and how these concepts are linked to              
              philosophical justifications and economic consequences.  These                 
              findings may provide useful input to the ongoing debate on                     
              controlling global warming.
