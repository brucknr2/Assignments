Abstract    :
                   The main goal of this research is the development of a local              
              and global structural stability theory for parabolic partial                   
              differential equations and a Floquet theory for time dependent                 
              linear parabolic equations.  Structural stability was first                    
              introduced in the study of ordinary differential equations, in                 
              particular for dynamical systems.  Many concepts of dynamical                  
              systems have been adapted to infinite dimensional systems,                     
              especially to partial differential equations which define                      
              dynamical systems on non-compact spaces.  However, those systems               
              generated by parabolic equations are not reversible.  This                     
              characteristic creates difficulties not encountered in the study               
              of finite dimensional dynamical systems and new methods must be                
              developed to understand the nature of these systems.  A theory                 
              for scalar reaction-diffusion equations has recently been                      
              obtained.                                                                      
                   Specific classes of equations such as the Cahn-Hilliard                   
              Equation and Phase-Field System will be considered for specific                
              analysis.  Other work will study structural stability of flows                 
              near periodic solutions for time-periodic parabolic equations.                 
              In the same spirit, efforts will be made to carry over the                     
              Floquet theory (too technical to describe here) from finite                    
              periodic systems to parabolic partial differential equations of                
              similar type.
