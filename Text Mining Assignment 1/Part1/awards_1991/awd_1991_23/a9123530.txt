Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and                     
              analysis of oceanographic data.  This proposal from the                        
              University of California requests funding for equipment that will              
              be used to support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V's                
              MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON, THOMAS WASHINGTON, and SPROUL.  The former              
              two vessels are owned by the Navy, while the latter two are owned              
              by the University.  All are operated by the University and                     
              provide extensive support to NSF funded oceanographic research                 
              projects.
