Abstract    :
              The goal of this work is to understand how flame stretch and                   
              flame curvature affect premixed flame properties.  A laminar                   
              vortex will be created in an existing test apparatus and will                  
              be interacted with a laminar premixed flame.  Vortex                           
              conditions first will be chosen to represent a single eddy in                  
              a turbulent flow to show how strain and flame curvature affect                 
              the local burning velocity, the creation of pockets of                         
              unburned CO pollutants, flame extinction, and deviations from                  
              the "laminar flamelet" profiles of temperature and OH                          
              concentration.  Secondly, vortex conditions later will be                      
              chosen to represent the piston-generated vortex of an internal                 
              combustion engine and the vortex will be interacted with a                     
              centrally ignited flame kernel in order to understand kernel                   
              growth in a realistic strain field.  Thirdly, the measurements                 
              will be used to assess and improve a recent full Navier-Stokes                 
              CFD simulation of the laminar flame-vortex interaction, which                  
              forms the "building block" of future models and can provide a                  
              useful submodel for existing statistical models.  Operational                  
              diagnostics to be employed include Rayleigh scattering for                     
              temperature images and profiles, OH and NO fluorescence                        
              imaging, and PIV to image the two-dimensional strain field.                    
                                                                                             
              This study should provide information useful to a number of                    
              other research efforts in the area of turbulent premixed flame                 
              structures.  In particular, it should be of use in development                 
              of better simulations of flame-vortex interactions, leading to                 
              better understanding and modeling of critical processes                        
              affecting levels of production of carbon monoxide and oxides                   
              of nitrogen in devices such as internal combustion engines, in                 
              which flame-vortex interactions play a crucial role.  This in                  
              turn will lead to definition of design strategies for                          
              reduction of levels of these pollutants produced by such                       
              engines, an important national need.
