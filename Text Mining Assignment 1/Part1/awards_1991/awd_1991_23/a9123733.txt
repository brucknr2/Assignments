Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The basic process of fertilization, fusion of egge sperm, is well              
              known in animals.  Flowering plants also produce eggs and sperm,               
              but little is known about the mechanism of fertilization.  Plant               
              sperm are embedded in pollen grains and move down the growing                  
              pollen tube to the egg.  Near the egg, the pollen tube bursts and              
              releases two sperms.  One sperm fuse with the egg to form the                  
              embryo of the seed.  The second sperm fuses with the central cell              
              adjacent to the egg to form a nutritive tissue for the developing              
              embryo.  A major unanswered question in plant reproduction is how              
              sperm recognize the egg and central cell, and then adhere and                  
              fuse.  A bioassay for sperm-egg adhesion will be developed using               
              frozen sections of embryo sacs, including eggs and central cells,              
              with isolated sperm.  The bioassay will be useful to test                      
              mechanisms of sperm-egg recognition and to determine which                     
              antibodies to sperm cell surfaces can inhibit sperm-egg adhesion.              
              The results will expand our knowledge of plant fertilization,                  
              create a model system for investigating plant reproduction, and                
              lead to identification of key molecules in the fertilization                   
              process for future genetic transformations.
