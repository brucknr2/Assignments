Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The combination of benign environmental impact and tuneable                    
              solvent power has led to a variety of extraction/separation                    
              applications for supercritical carbon dioxide.  Despite these                  
              inherent advantages, the low solubility of highly polar or                     
              hydrophilic compounds in non-polar CO2 has blocked the use of                  
              supercritical fluid technology in areas such as protein                        
              purification, the remediation of heavy metal contamination,                    
              and non-VOC based coatings formulations, where generation of a                 
              highly pure and readily recoverable product would be a                         
              significant advance.  Recent research by other groups has                      
              shown that the formation of micelles in supercritical fluids                   
              provides a means by which low solubility of polar compounds in                 
              non-polar fluids can be overcome.  Despite this advance,                       
              formation of stable micelles in CO2 (as opposed to alkanes)                    
              has remained elusive, due primarily to the low solubility of                   
              commercially-available surfactants in carbon dioxide at                        
              moderate pressures.  Thus this project proposes to synthesize                  
              model amphiphiles where the "hydrophobic" tails contain                        
              functional groups, such as fluoroethers and silicones, which                   
              are known to interact favorably (in a thermodynamic sense)                     
              with carbon dioxide.  Preliminary results at the University of                 
              Pittsburgh with fluoroalkyl, fluoroether, and silicone                         
              materials show that this premise is indeed valid.  This                        
              project extends these successful preliminaries with a program                  
              of rational synthesis of surfactants and phase behavior                        
              studies.
