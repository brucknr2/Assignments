Abstract    :
                   The West Indies harbor many different types (species) of                  
              plants and animals found nowhere else in the world.  They are                  
              rapidly disappearing because of demands on the environment,                    
              especially the felling of trees, due to a high human population                
              density.  It is important to find out how many species exist and               
              where they are located on the islands os that conservation areas,              
              such as national parks, can be established to protect them.  The               
              four largest islands in the Caribbean basin, the Greater                       
              Antilles, have the greatest number of unique species.  This                    
              research involves exploration of poorly known areas and                        
              identification of the herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles),                  
              which are the most abundant and diverse of the land animals with               
              backbones (vertebrates).
