Abstract    :
              This project is a joint effort between the North                               
              Carolina State University, the University of                                   
              Nebraska, and LEAP Associates, Inc., as part                                   
              of the PRESSS Phase II Coordinated Research                                    
              Program to investigate the seismic behavior of                                 
              precast concrete systems typical of the eastern                                
              and central United States.  Buildings targeted                                 
              by this study are low-rise precast concrete                                    
              structures in zones of low to moderate                                         
              seismicity.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Research tasks will be conducted in the                                        
              following stages:  system analysis, experimental                               
              investigation of panel connections, experimental                               
              investigation of frame connections, and system                                 
              design aspects (production and construction).                                  
              The project will focus on systems rather than                                  
              being limited to isolated details in order that                                
              the end product may be readily applied to the                                  
              needs of industry.
