Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with developing a theoretical                        
              foundation for learning in neural networks and artificial                      
              intelligence in the direction of statistical decision theory and               
              analysis of algorithms.  The proposed work includes several                    
              aspects.  First, further extensions and applications of the                    
              statistical techniques of Vapnik and Chervonenkis are pursued.                 
              Second, a coherent Bayesian metholody is developed for learning                
              that includes the Valnik-Chervonenkis theory and the recent                    
              statistical physics approached to learning.  Third, weighted                   
              majority and other on-line learning strategies are developed,                  
              including extensions to nonstationary learning environments.                   
              Finally, analysis and application of unsupervised learning and                 
              feature discovery techniques are performed.
