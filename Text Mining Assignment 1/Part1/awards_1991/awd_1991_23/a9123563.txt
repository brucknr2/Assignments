Abstract    :
              The objective of this study is to investigate infiltration through             
              a soil matrix possessing dual porosity. The duality is                         
              attributed to the existence of micropores at a length scale                    
              consistent with the size of individual soil grains, and macropores             
              of a size significantly larger than an individual soil grain.                  
              Primary attention is focused on the macropores, as infiltration                
              through a homogeneous soil with micropores has already been solved             
              with some success. The project results will impact several fields              
              of soil hydraulics, including agricultural applications,                       
              groundwater recharge, landfill cover design, and contaminant                   
              transport in the vadose zone.
