Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There has been a longstanding debate as to the rate at which our               
              ancestors, the australopithecines, matured and developed.  Some                
              say they had a long period of childhood dependency as we do;                   
              others say they followed the development pattern of modern apes,               
              while others propose a unique pattern.  The resolution of this                 
              debate will tell us much about the evolution of learning ability               
              and culture, for a long childhood dependency accompanies the need              
              for a long period of learning.  This dissertation improvement                  
              project will help to clarify the issue by carrying out extensive               
              examination of the one relatively complete australopithecine of                
              juvenile age - Laetoli Hominid 21.  Metric and non-metric aspects              
              of the skeleton will be compared with samples of modern apes and               
              humans and thereby give us a better picture of the developmental               
              pattern in this ancestral form.
