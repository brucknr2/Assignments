Abstract    :
              This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                 
              program is concerned with chemistry of 4d and 5d metal                         
              porphyrin and tetraazaporphyrin complexes.  Specific areas to                  
              be considered are multiple metal-metal bonded dimers (including                
              heterometallic bonds), mesodiscotic liquid crystals (and                       
              possibly ferroelectric fibers), and electrochemical catalysts                  
              for multielectron redox reactions of molecular hydrogen,                       
              oxygen, nitrogen, and ammonia.

              This research is intended to produce a set of new and unusual                  
              substances whose physical and chemical properties will add to                  
              our fundamental understanding of the structures and                            
              reactivities of the heavy transition elements and the                          
              mechanisms of mysterious multi-electron redox processes, such                  
              as nitrogen fixation, that are catalyzed by metalloenzymes.                    
              Unusual catalysts and liquid crystalline materials may result                  
              from this highly interdisciplinary research.
