Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The 32nd Midwest Regional Developmental Biology Conference, to be              
              held May 13-16, at the University of Dayton will provide an                    
              opportunity for established investigators, graduate students and               
              postdoctoral students in the midwest to exchange ideas, both                   
              informally and formally, by presenting their most recent findings              
              on the platform, and by means of posters. This will provide an                 
              opportunity for graduate and postdoctoral students to present                  
              their own work, often for the first time and to also observe                   
              examples of excellence provided by presentations made by veteran               
              investigators, To ensure the latter, there will be an invited                  
              keynote speaker for all platform presentation sessions. The                    
              extensive interaction among students, faculty and invited                      
              speakers will promote the exchange of new information and an                   
              enthusiasm for teaching and research in developmental biology.
