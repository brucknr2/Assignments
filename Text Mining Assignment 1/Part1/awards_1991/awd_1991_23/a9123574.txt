Abstract    :
              9123574  Hermans'  This project will create a workstation cluster in the 
              Molecular Modeling Laboratory that will be used for studies  of structure and
              function of biological macromolecules as  well as for other biological studies.
               The workstations will  also be available for students to use in classes and 
              workshops.  The workstation cluster will be employed  principally by
              investigators who use quantum mechanics and  molecular dynamics in
              understanding molecular structures and  biological activity.  Examples of  such
              areas include  physical chemistry of ionic interactions and of phospholipid 
              membranes, problems of folding and conformational stability  of proteins and
              peptides, and interaction of small molecules  and proteins with nucleic acids.
