Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a group of three U.S.                                      
              computer scientists coordinated by Professor                                   
              Steven Homer of Boston University to collaborate                               
              with Professor Peter van Emde Boas and others of                               
              the Department of Mathematics and Computer                                     
              Science of the University of Amsterdam, the                                    
              Netherlands.  Their research will focus on                                     
              several current topics in the theory of                                        
              computation, including structural complexity                                   
              theory and Kolmogorov complexity theory.  The                                  
              planned collaboration will be expedited by                                     
              several reciprocal working meetings among the                                  
              participants that will give opportunities to                                   
              local young researchers and particularly                                       
              graduate students to benefit from participation                                
              in the discussions.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This research lies on the boundary between                                     
              mathematics and computer science.  The various                                 
              research partnerships among the seven                                          
              participants should yield significant results in                               
              several central areas of complexity theory.  The                               
              complementary expertise contributed by the U.S.                                
              and Dutch participants has the potential to                                    
              contribute insights and connections which would                                
              not emerge without the cooperative interactions.
