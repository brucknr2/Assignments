Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Experimental studies on the characterization of impurities,                    
              particularly those that form deep levels, in II-VI and other                   
              semiconductors by advanced X-ray techniques are being conducted.               
              The principal goal of the research is to obtain a direct                       
              correlation of the luminescent properties of wide bandgap                      
              semiconductors and local concentration of specific impurities.                 
              Although remarkable results have recently been obtained for blue-              
              emitting laser heterjunction diodes based on ZnSe, the role of                 
              impurities in limiting the maximum carrier concentration of p-type             
              ZnSe is not understood, and it is expected that the results of this            
              research will be of significant benefit to the understanding and               
              improvement of II-VI materials, in general, as well as other                   
              semiconductors.                                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              This research is expected to aid in finding solutions for several              
              problems and to contribute to the understanding of outstanding                 
              issues in II-VI materials related to impurities at low                         
              concentrations which adversely affect fundamental radiative                    
              processes determining the feasibility and efficiency of                        
              optoelectronic devices such as lasers and light emitting                       
              diodes(LED).  Understanding the fundamental nature of the influence            
              of ultra-low levels of impurities in these materials will                      
              contribute toward the realization of improved optoelectronic                   
              devices operating in the blue spectral region.
