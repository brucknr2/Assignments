Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An International Symposium on Atomic Layer Epitaxy(ALE), a                     
              relatively new subfield of epitaxy, is being held to assess the ALE            
              field, and to establish ties between universities, research                    
              institutions, and industry. It is expected that top scientists in              
              the field will attend, and that the symposium will provide an                  
              effective forum to discuss and delineate the critical scientific               
              issues in this research area, and to consider and define the                   
              approaches and techniques needed to address them. Understanding and            
              controlling processes at the atomic level are becoming increasingly            
              important for electronic and photonic materials, and ALE represents            
              an advantageous way of achieving layer-by-layer control through the            
              self limiting aspects of the process to yield accurate layer                   
              thicknesses and uniformity on an atomic scale over wafer-scale                 
              dimensions.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              An evaluation of the status of ALE, and recommendations by the                 
              symposium participants for the emphasis of future work, and their              
              assessment of the most important contemporary research issues will             
              be of great value to the understanding and development of the                  
              technique of ALE, and for its subsequent utilization in the field              
              of microelectronics.
