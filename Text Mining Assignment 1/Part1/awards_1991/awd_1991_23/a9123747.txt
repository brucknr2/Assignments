Abstract    :
                 This research explores emerging concepts of minimalist                      
              robotics, by analyzing compliant motion planning for manipulators              
              with reduced sensing and actuation complexity such as the                      
              parallel-jaw gripper, as alternatives to more complex                          
              multifingered, multijointed robot hands which can be more                      
              difficult to program.  The work investigates means to program                  
              grasp, recognition, orientation, and positioning of an                         
              industrially-important class of parts whose cross-sections can be              
              represented by a combination of curved arcs and straight                       
              polygonal edges.  The research combines computational analysis of              
              part geometry with methods from stochastic estimation theory.  A               
              programmable parts kitting system will be developed as an                      
              experimental testbed.  This system will automatically generate                 
              programs for CAD models of parts, for robot recognition and                    
              manipulation of those parts.
