Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The effects of the nomination campaign on the general election have            
              been a concern of political scientists for decades.  The concern               
              is based on a nomination campaign which promotes factions with the             
              party's rank and file membership.  Conventional wisdom believes                
              that the current presidential selection process is divisive and has            
              negative consequences for the party's ability to run a successful              
              campaign during the general election campaign.  However, research              
              on the divisive nomination and carryover effect hypotheses has                 
              yielded mixed results indicating a need for further research.                  
                                                                                             
              This doctoral dissertation research project will examine the                   
              divisive nomination and carryover hypotheses in two distinct, but              
              complementary ways.  First, the student will rexamine the in-                  
              group/out-group expectation with an experimental design which                  
              simulates the presidential selection process.  The second part of              
              the design involves examination of National Election Studies data              
              collected during the nomination and general election stages of a               
              presidential campaign.  The survey analysis will focus on attitude             
              development and behavior by party identifiers toward the party                 
              nominee during the nomination and general election stages of the               
              campaign.  This examination of individual attitudes and behavior               
              will link the two stages of the process and help in understanding              
              how the entire presidential selection process influences attitudes             
              and behaviors.
