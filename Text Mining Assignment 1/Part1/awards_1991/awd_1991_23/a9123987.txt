Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his study of                     
              analytic torsion. This is a poorly understood topological                      
              invariant of manifolds that can be defined using purely analytic               
              techniques, yet cannot be determined from local information. The               
              main idea of the research will be to relate the analytic torsion               
              to other geometric invariants of the manifold.                                 
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry               
              is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space               
              and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                 
              the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of               
              a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                 
              these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                       
              structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                 
              the large scale structure of the universe.
