Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on a membrane process                     
              of for oxygenation of water.  The research involves                            
              evaluation of the mass transfer characteristics of                             
              vertically oriented hollow fibers, arranged in packets,                        
              and within which an atmosphere of pure oxygen is                               
              maintained.  The oxygen is transferred to the                                  
              horizontally-flowing fluid through the fiber walls without                     
              the formation of bubbles as is characteristic of                               
              conventional oxygenation processes.  This concept has a                        
              potential for providing the required amount of respiratory                     
              oxygen at a rate that is consistent with the biochemical                       
              oxygen demand of the bioprocess without the loss of                            
              efficiency that is characteristic of oxygenation processes                     
              that depend on oxygen-transfer from a rising or                                
              circulating pattern of bubbles.                                                
                                                                                             
              Submerged-culture, biological processes for treatment of                       
              wastewaters depend upon an adequate movement of oxygen                         
              into the reaction vessel to maintain a high rate of                            
              aerobic, biological activity.  Applications of the concept                     
              expected to emerge from this research also include                             
              bringing effluents from wastewater treatment processes up                      
              to levels consistent with maintenance of good levels of                        
              oxygen in receiving streams, in maintaining desired levels                     
              of oxygen in ice-covered lakes, and in compensating for                        
              loss of oxygen during use of hydropower in the  generation                     
              of electricity.
