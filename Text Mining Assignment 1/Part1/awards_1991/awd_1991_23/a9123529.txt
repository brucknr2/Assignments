Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Program Summary:                                                               
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data. This proposal from NCSU requests funding for            
              equipment to upgrade a mass spectrometer facility. The mass                    
              spectrometer was originally purchased in 1984 withfunding from the             
              oceanographic instrumentation program  (OCE83-10579) and ONR. THe              
              upgrades requested include a Kiel single acid bath auto-carbonated             
              reaction system and fully automated multiport system. The Kiel                 
              system is necessary to analyze small carbonate samples, and the                
              automated multiport will allow unattended, automatic operation,                
              increasing the efficiency of the facility. NCSU will  provide 50%              
              cost-sharing this purchase.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The instrument will improve the analysis of small sample-size                  
              carbonates which are increasingly important for oceanographic                  
              studies. It will be maintained and operated as a shared-use                    
              facility. The PI is well qualified to acquire, maintain, operate               
              and manage the instrument. Cost sharing by the University is                   
              appropriate.
