Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is to support the building of Softlab, a laboratory that            
              supports research in computational science and engineering.  The               
              facilities provided include:                                                   
                                                                                             
              1.   High performance graphics processors for scientific                       
                   visualization, geometric modeling, and multimedia                         
                   graphical user interfaces for parallel programming                        
                   and programming in the large.                                             
                                                                                             
              2.   High-performance computing power, upgrading Purdues' parallel             
                   machines.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              3.   Software and development support staff assisting application              
                   researchers in making full use of this facility comprising                
                   a rich spectrum of high-performance workstations, powerful                
                   parallel machines, and dedicated graphics processors.                     
                                                                                             
              4.   A teaching laboratory providing exploratory course that                   
                   migrate cutting-edge research into the curriculum with access             
                   to state-of-the-art facilities.  This laboratory will be the              
                   principal facility of a proposed new interdisciplinary                    
                   graduate degree program in Computational Engineering and                  
                   Science.
