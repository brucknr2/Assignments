Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              They propose a study of quantum liquids via deep inelastic neutron             
              scattering to obtain the atomic momentum distribution function,                
              n(p).  The focus will be on the properties of liquid helium-3 and              
              mixtures of He-3 and He-4, and the effects of restricted geometries            
              on n(p) of liquid helium-4.  Secondly, elastic neutron scattering              
              will be used to probe the structure of both solid and liquid phases            
              of quantum systems, such as helium and hydrogen, inside porous                 
              media.
