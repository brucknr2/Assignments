Abstract    :
                   In many coastal species, a critical platonic larval stage is              
              spent in the waters of the inner continental shelf, the most                   
              shoreward few kilometers of the shelf where depths are typically               
              less than 30 m.  Our knowledge of the parameters of the shelf                  
              where these planktonic larvae live is meager.  Physical processes              
              which strongly influence the biology, such as sediment transport               
              and the stratification and circulation of inner shelf waters, are              
              poorly understood.  A major goal of this study is to obtain                    
              synoptic, moored, long-term measurements of biological, physical               
              and sediment transport parameters at the same time and space                   
              scales.  The field program is aimed at gaining insight into the                
              processes that may control the successful dispersal and                        
              settlement of planktonic larvae of organisms living in near-shore              
              sandy sediments.  The study is designed so that critical                       
              disciplinary, as well as interdisciplinary questions can be                    
              addressed.  The basic hypothesis guiding the research is that                  
              planktonic larvae of organisms living in the intertidal zone (or               
              in very shallow water) exploit the circulation of the inner shelf              
              to control their cross-shelf transport.
