Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI proposes a one-year development program to design, construct            
              and dock-test a moored profiling instrument that will repeatedly               
              profile a vertical water column.  This prototype will test the                 
              feasibility of a system designed to continually profile to depths              
              of 6000 meters and to obtain a time series temperature, salinity               
              and current velocity.  Such a system would provide valuable data at            
              very low costs compared to the current shipboard data acquisition              
              systems.  The system could also be deployed in remote locations                
              that are seldom traversed by oceanographic research vessels.
