Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award for a long-term visit to the United Kingdom will                    
              support cooperative research in fungal ecology between David M.                
              Sylvia of the University of Florida and Peter Jeffries of the                  
              University of Kent in the United Kingdom.  The objectives of their             
              research are to understand vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal               
              function in the soil and to evaluate the impact of the external fungal         
              hyphae on plant competition for soil nutrients.  Mycorrhizal fungi             
              have an important role in increasing plant uptake of phosphorous               
              and other poorly-mobile nutrients from soil. The external                      
              mycorrhizal hyphae are filament structures which enable the update             
              of nutrients through plant roots.  By studying the external hyphae,            
              the researchers will be able to evaluate the survival, distribution,           
              and competitive ability of VA mycorrhizal fungi in soil systems.               
                                                                                             
              Previous work on the hyphae of VA mycorrhizal fungi have been                  
              limited due to the difficulty of obtaining large quantities of hyphae          
              free from contaminating soil. The U.S. investigator brings to this             
              collaboration his technique of culturing fungi free from soil and              
              plant material.  This is complemented by the immunological                     
              approaches of Dr. Jeffries which will enable the investigators to              
              detect and evaluate the impact of mycorrhizal fungi in situ.
