Abstract    :
                   Professor Mowat will carry out experiments on the ion-                    
              storage ring, CRYRING, at the Mann Siegbahn Institute in                       
              Stockholm, Sweden.  The dynamics of electron-induced dissociative              
              processes in HeH+ + e collisions as well as the hyperfine                      
              structure spectroscopy of highly ionized (aluminum-like) ions                  
              will be the focus of his research.
