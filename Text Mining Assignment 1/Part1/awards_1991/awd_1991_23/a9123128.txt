Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplementary support                                  
              to enable Dr. Stephen Wong of Lehigh University                                
              to conduct collaborative research with Dr.                                     
              Kazumasa Yokota for 12 months at the Institute                                 
              for New Generation Computer Technology (ICOT)                                  
              in Japan.  Wong and Yokota will apply Wong's                                   
              designs for cooperative artificial intelligence                                
              (AI) systems to develop a prototype to test                                    
              this new class of computers.                                                   
                                                                                             
              For contemporary AI, the basic mechanisms of                                   
              reasoning and problem solving remain bound to a                                
              single, monolithic conception of knowledge and                                 
              action.  In order to solve more complex                                        
              problems, AI systems will need to coordinate                                   
              their problem solving techniques, developing                                   
              collections of interactive, cooperative                                        
              knowledge-based processes.  ICOT's world-                                      
              leading research on parallel inference                                         
              computing and logic programming will complement                                
              Wong's model design of a cooperative AI system                                 
              and facilitate the development of an                                           
              operational cooperative AI system.
