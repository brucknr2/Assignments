Abstract    :
                   The National Research Council's Committee on Science,                     
              Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP) proposal describes a                  
              study of the process by which NSF reviews research proposals,                  
              particulary with reference to large projects.  This study                      
              responds to a directive in the Congressional conference report                 
              accompanying the NSF appropriation for fiscal year 1991 for such               
              a study.                                                                       
                   COSEPUP, which has for 30 years served as a source of high                
              level advice to science advisors and other senior government                   
              officials, has the broad experience required to undertake a study              
              of the criteria and procedures used by NSF in reviewing and                    
              awarding major grants.  The study will be conducted over a period              
              of 15 months under the direction of a panel of experts and result              
              in a report that assesses the current system and makes                         
              recommendations for improvements, as appropriate.
