Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Theoretical research will be conducted to characterize the                     
              large amplitude, non-linear stability properties of a fluid                    
              with motion driven by unstable buoyancy, but stabilized by a                   
              mechanically driven oscillatory boundary. Previous research                    
              has shown that stabilization can be achieved with the proper                   
              driving oscillation when only small amplitude disturbances are                 
              considered. The present investigation is to explore the large                  
              amplitude regime, where it is conjectured that mechanical                      
              boundary oscillations can result in a strong inhibition of                     
              thermally driven motion.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The results have application to such engineering systems as                    
              Chemical Vapor Deposition of thin films, where prevention of                   
              flow instabilities could result in larger useful rates of                      
              deposition.
