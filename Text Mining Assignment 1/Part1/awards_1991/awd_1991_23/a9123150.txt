Abstract    :
              9123150  Kundu       This project will determine the frequency of maximum 
              correlation of the solar microwave flux with the total solar  irradiance, and
              to obtain statistical evidence regarding the  sources of the correlation.  The
              goals are to overcome some of the  failure of the 2800 MHz microwave flux to
              provide adequate proxy  data for irradiance measurements, and to use the
              additional  information in multi-frequency data to reveal the physical reasons 
              for the presence or absence of certain correlations.       Using the solar flux
              data at 1000, 2000, 3750 and 9400 MHz  from Toyokawa Observatory, along with
              the 2800 MHz flux data from  Ottawa, the PI will correlate the microwave
              observations with  irradiance measurements obtained by The Active Cavity
              Radiometer  Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) aboard the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM). 
                   The project will model the microwave flux spectrum in the  1000-9400 MHz
              range in order to extract its principal (sunspot,  coronal and chromospheric)
              components.  Using the known  associations of these spectral components with
              optical  observations, the PI will obtain their relative normalizations so 
              that the components may be identified from the microwave  measurements alone. 
              Finally, the PI will obtain the optimum  functional relationships by which the
              microwave flux spectrum can  be used as a proxy for solar irradiance.  ***
