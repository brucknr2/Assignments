Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goals of the research to be carried out under this award are               
              (1) to map the velocity field of galaxies within a distance of                 
              approximately 100 megaparsecs, and (2) to attempt to understand                
              this velocity field in terms of a model in which galaxies are                  
              accelerated by a gravitational field related to all of galaxies in             
              this volume.  In order to carry out this mapping a set of 68                   
              clusters of galaxies will be used.  The relative distances of these            
              clusters and their mean redshifts will be measured.  A comparison              
              of the observed and predicted velocity fields will enable the                  
              investigators to learn about the mass distribution in this volume              
              of space and the background density on which the visible galaxy                
              clusters and voids are superposed.                                             
                                                                                             
              The Principle Investigator is recognized to be an expert in this               
              particular area of research.
