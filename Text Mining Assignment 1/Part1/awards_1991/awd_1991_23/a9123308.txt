Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports infrastructure for research in high                        
              performance parallel/distributed computing.  The award supports                
              the purchase of a high performance distributed memory computer.                
              The award also supports a programmer to develop, maintain, and                 
              distribute software developed on this computer.                                
                                                                                             
              The research supported by this infrastructure is of two forms:                 
              compute intensive research and systems applications research.                  
              The compute intensive research includes computer vision, computer              
              graphics, simulations, 3-D animation, and computational                        
              chemistry.  The systems applications research includes developing              
              fast operating system kernal service routines, programming models              
              of parallel computation activities, software engineering                       
              environments, and fundamental research on parallel algorithms for              
              distributed memory computers.
