Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Minorities are not well represented in careers in science,                     
              particularly the marine sciences. Considerable effort is being made            
              to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in                
              marine science.  This renewal is a two-year training program in                
              marine sciences at the Duke University Marine Laboratory. It                   
              includes a semester-in-residence program for undergraduates in                 
              their junior or senior year of college, which provides a                       
              comprehensive educational and research experience for the students.            
              This is combined with a mentor-in-residence and instructional                  
              assistant, who will function as tutors and role models. It also                
              includes a visiting-scholar program in which each year four                    
              minority scientists will spend several days on campus interacting              
              with the students.
