Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award for U.S.-U.K. cooperative research will support a long-             
              term visit to the United Kingdom.  Dr. Jeanne Selker of the                    
              University of Oregon and Dr. Robert Lyndon of the University of                
              Edinburgh will jointly study the transition in patterns of appendage           
              formation in developing plants.  They will study two plant systems:            
              (1) Silene transition to flowering; and (2) watercress root-to-shoot           
              conversion.  The proposed work will involve observations of the                
              growth of apices during the transition period and experiments                  
              aimed at identifying the causal events which either prevent                    
              transition or produce no effect whatsoever.  Dr. Selker brings to              
              this collaboration expertise in the biophysical characterization of            
              cell patterns in plant apices.  This is complemented by Dr.                    
              Lyndon's extensive work on the Silene and watercress systems and               
              his innovative experimental approaches to characterizing and                   
              manipulating plant developing systems.                                         
                                                                                             
              Plant appendages, such as leaves, petals and stamens, are produced             
              at the shoot apex in a pattern.  Researchers do not understand how             
              appendages are produced in a specific pattern or what causes these             
              patterns to change.  The proposed research will yield valuable                 
              knowledge and correlations about the transition processes and                  
              pattern formations.
