Abstract    :
              9123074  York    The Digital Sky Survey is designed to produce a detailed
              digital  photometric map of half the northern sky to about 23rd magnitude.  
              This map will be used to select about a million galaxies and  100,000 quasars
              for which high-resolution spectra will be obtained  with the same wide-field
              special purpose telescope.  The imaging  survey will also be used to produce a
              catalog in four colors of all  the detected objects, about 108 galaxies and a
              similar number of  stars, and a million quasar candidates.  The survey
              telescope will  take about four years to build and test; the survey would then
              be  completed over a five-year period.  This award supports the final  design
              of the telescopes.  ***
