Abstract    :
                   This grant will support the Plasma Science Committee of the               
              National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council.  The                   
              Plasma Science Committee convenes meetings, receives briefings                 
              from agencies, and forms study panels to prepare reports on a                  
              broad range of issues important to the health of basic and                     
              applied plasma science.
