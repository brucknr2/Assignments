Abstract    :
                   This grant supports research to study nucleon                             
              interactions and nuclear dynamics with neutrons by scientists                  
              of the University of California at Davis.  Nuclear reactions                   
              and scattering at neutron energies from 60 to 260 MeV will be                  
              carried out at Crocker Nuclear Laboratory and Los Alamos                       
              National Laboratory for a range of nuclear targets.  In                        
              addition, studies of relativistic nuclear collisions centered                  
              at the Heavy Ion Superconducting Spectrometer at Lawrence                      
              Berkeley Laboratory will be augmented with a new time                          
              projection chamber, which is now under construction.  Planning                 
              and detector research and development by the U.C.-Davis group                  
              for the STAR detector at RHIC is also being supported.
