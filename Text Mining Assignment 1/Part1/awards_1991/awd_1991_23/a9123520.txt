Abstract    :
              Issues in the efficient implementation of concurrent constraint                
              programming languages are considered in this project.  In particular,          
              program analysis, transformation, and optimization are emphasized.             
              Four stages comprise this investigation.  First, abstract                      
              interpretation frameworks for concurrent constraint programming                
              languages are examined emphasizing the development of efficient                
              dataflow algorithms.  Next, assertion language and tools for                   
              manipulating user annotations are studied.  Then, runtime data                 
              representation issues and interactions with concurrency are                    
              considered.  Finally, compile-time analysis and control of task                
              granularity for the effective utilization of parallel hardware are             
              examined.
