Abstract    :
                   This project will allow botanists at the the California                   
              Academy of Sciences to complete three activities that are                      
              critical to preserving and making available for study parts of                 
              the botanical collection.   These activities are: (1) Mounting                 
              and curating a historic collection of 40,000 plants from Sierra                
              Nevada; (2) curation of the Lupinus collection, perhaps the                    
              finest in North America; and (3) refoldering all type specimens                
              within acid-free folders.  CAS's plant collection, with                        
              approximately 1.6 million mounted specimens and 8900 primary and               
              secondary types, is the fifth largest in the U.S.  Geographic                  
              representation is weighted toward North America and Latin America              
              (75%), with major holdings from California and Mexico.                         
              Collection use by professionals and students is high over the                  
              past five years (700 visitors; 400 loans, 65,500 specimens).                   
              This project will insure the conservation of extremely important               
              holdings at CAS and increasing the availability of the collection              
              for studies in biodiversity of North and MesoAmerican plants.
