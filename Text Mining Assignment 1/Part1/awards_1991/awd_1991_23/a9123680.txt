Abstract    :
              The manipulation of mammalian cell biology to efficiently                      
              over-express useful therapeutic or diagnostic proteins                         
              with control over protein integrity is one of the most                         
              important cross-disciplinary areas of research in                              
              biotechnology.  Until recently, this field of engineering                      
              science and quantitative cell biology was one of the least                     
              explored areas of investigation.  In view of the rapidly                       
              expanding knowledge of the regulation of protein                               
              synthesis, post-translational processing and secretion                         
              during the past two years, a third cross-disciplinary                          
              conference entirely devoted to cell culture engineering is                     
              timely.  This conference will bring together scientists                        
              interested in the biology of secretory protein synthesis,                      
              post-translational processing, protein secretions, control                     
              of cellular differentiation in vitro, and transgenic                           
              expression systems, with engineers interested in                               
              bioreactor technology, tissue engineering, vaccine                             
              production, process monitoring, protein homogeneity, and                       
              protein purity.
