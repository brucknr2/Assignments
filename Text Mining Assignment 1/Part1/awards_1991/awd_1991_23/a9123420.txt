Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Time series data for the major compounds in the cycle of dime                  
              thylsulfide in open ocean water will be integrated with                        
              experimental studies to address controlling processes.  DMS,                   
              DMSP, and DMSO will be measured in Bermuda waters in conjunction               
              with the time-series studies at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series               
              program.  Complementary chemical and biological data collected as              
              part of the JGOFS program will provide insights into the                       
              importance of blooms and phytoplankton speciation to the DMS                   
              cycle.  Specific processes involved in the cycling of DMS, its                 
              precursors an its products, will be investigated in coordinated                
              laboratory experiments.  Time-series measurements and laboratory               
              experiments will be linked by a series of short but intensive                  
              process-oriented field studies at the Bermuda site to test                     
              hypotheses derived from time-series and laboratory work.  The                  
              major goal of the project is to identify and quantify the key                  
              controlling processes throughout the annual cycle.
