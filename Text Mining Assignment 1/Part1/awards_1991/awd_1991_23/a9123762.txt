Abstract    :
                   An REU Site will be formed to bring ten to twelve                         
              undergraduate students per year from across the nation to                      
              spend ten weeks during the summer at the J.R. MacDonald                        
              Laboratory at Kansas State University to engage in research in                 
              experimental and theoretical atomic physics.  Many exciting                    
              and challenging experiments in atomic collisions are being                     
              carried out at the JRM Laboratory which is equipped with a                     
              variety of accelerators and a new EBIS source for producing                    
              multiply charged ions.  These undergraduate students will                      
              share the excitement of research and gain experience in using                  
              these unique facilities through their participation in                         
              carrying out research with the large body of faculty and                       
              graduate students in the JRM Laboratory.  This experience will                 
              help students in making decisions toward a career in                           
              scientific research.
