Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The economic dependence of married women on their husbands is             
              an important yet hidden dimension of inequality in contemporary                
              society.  This dependence persists even among employed wives, who              
              typically earn less than their husbands.  This project will provide            
              a new framework within which to view contemporary American marriage            
              by constructing and validating measures for three distinct                     
              dimensions of wives' material dependence:  the level of actual                 
              economic dependence, the level of economic independence possible               
              if homemaker wives were employed full-time, and the degree to which            
              wives are dependent upon their husbands for social prestige.  The              
              theoretical importance of these concepts will be examined by                   
              testing the explanatory power of models derived from sex-role                  
              socialization theory (the internalization of attitudes and                     
              aspirations as a result of early childhood upbringing) and a                   
              structural gender stratification theory (the concrete context of               
              work and family which either pushes women out of the labor force               
              or pulls them into it as lifetime workers) for predicting the level            
              of individual women's dependence.  Using data from the Career                  
              Development Study from the state of Washington and from the cross-             
              sectional, national probability sample of the National Survey of               
              Families and Households, these measures of material dependence will            
              be used to predict indicators of gender equity within marriage.                
                                                                                             
                   This project will fill a major gap in the sociological study              
              of marriage and the family, contributing to our understanding of               
              their nature and functioning and yielding knowledge about the                  
              consequences of economic dependence on the division of household               
              labor as well as on wife abuse.
