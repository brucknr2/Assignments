Abstract    :
                   Axler and Shapiro will continue their study of the                        
              connection between classical function theory and operator theory.              
              Of particular interest will be the association between function                
              theoretic properties of an analytic mapping and operator                       
              theoretic properties of the corresponding composition, Toeplitz,               
              and Hankel operators.                                                          
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problems in operator theory is to classify                
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
