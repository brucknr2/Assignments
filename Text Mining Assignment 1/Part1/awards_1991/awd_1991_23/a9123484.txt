Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Martin A. Uman and several                       
              junior members of his research group at the University of                      
              Florida to collaborate in a study of the behavior of lightning                 
              with Professor Michel Ianoz and others of the Laboratory of                    
              Electrical Energy Research, Swiss Federal Institute of                         
              Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland.  They will carry out                        
              research in the modeling of return strokes and the                             
              applications of these models to horizontal power line coupling                 
              of close lightning strokes.  The research plan expands and                     
              enhances Dr. Uman's ongoing cooperative research with this                     
              group and others at the Universities of Bologna and Rome,                      
              Italy.  It makes use of measurements obtained by the U.S. and                  
              Swiss research groups at the NASA Kennedy Space Center in                      
              1991, using Swiss equipment.  The collaborators also plan to                   
              collect more data from further joint experiments.                              
                                                                                             
              This research will advance basic knowledge about lightning and                 
              its possible electromagnetic interactions.  Its applications                   
              are of particular importance to electric power distribution                    
              systems in the United States and elsewhere.  It links three                    
              very strong research groups and provides an outstanding                        
              training opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral                    
              fellows in Dr. Uman's research group at the University of                      
              Florida.
