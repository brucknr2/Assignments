Abstract    :
              This interdisciplinary project supported by the Inorganic,                     
              Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program in the                       
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the                         
              Biophysics program in the Biological Sciences Directorate                      
              combines the expertise of chemists and molecular biologists in                 
              the elucidation of structure function relationships in                         
              cytochrome c.  The aims of the research are: 1) to examine, in                 
              vitro, the effects of mutations within the heme environment on                 
              the redox potential and electron transfer reactivity of the                    
              cytochrome, and to compare the effects observed in vitro with                  
              the in vivo reactivity of the cytochrome, and 2) to determine                  
              the stabilities of the mutant cytochromes using both kinetic                   
              and thermodynamic methods with the ultimate objective of                       
              determining how protein stability can be linked to the level of                
              protein expression of the cell.  Recombinant DNA procedures                    
              will be used to obtain the mutant cytochromes from the yeast                   
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae that will be used in these studies.                   
              Estimation of the amount of cyctochrome present in cells will                  
              be done using the spectral response of the heme chromaphore.                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The objective of this research is to further our understanding                 
              of the ways in which variations in the structure of                            
              biomolecules, and that of metalloproteins in particular, affect                
              their biological function.  Because of the difficulty of making                
              direct observations on biological molecules in vivo, studies                   
              will initially be made in vitro and then behavior that can be                  
              studied in vivo, such as the rate of protein production by the                 
              cell, will be correlated with the in vitro measurements.
