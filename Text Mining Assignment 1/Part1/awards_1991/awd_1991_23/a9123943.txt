Abstract    :
              As the number of species facing extinction in the wild continues               
              to increase, the role of captive breeding programs in preserving               
              biotic diversity will become more important.  Decisions regarding              
              management of captive populations can have large impacts on their              
              genetic diversity and may ultimately affect the survival of                    
              threatened species.  The influence of captive breeding strategies              
              on the viability of individuals and populations will be assessed               
              in two related experiments.  First, small populations of the                   
              mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) will be managed using one of four              
              strategies that have been suggested for the management of captive              
              populations.  This experiment will determine how these strategies              
              affect the reproduction, growth, development and survival of                   
              individuals in captivity.  Second, individuals from these                      
              populations will be used to found populations in large microcosms,             
              designed to simulate small ponds.  This experiment will determine              
              if the way a captive population is managed will affect its ability             
              to establish successful wild populations.  The influence of captive            
              breeding strategies on the number of individuals that need to be               
              released to establish successful wild populations will also be                 
              examined.  This research will help improve management of captive               
              breeding populations, while also helping to ensure the success of              
              reintroduction programs.
