Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This SQUID-based sample magnetometer will perform fast, precise                
              measurements of the magnetic properties of materials over a broad              
              range of temperatures and applied magnetic fields.  It has a                   
              complete and sophisticated computer operating system for control               
              and analysis and allows for total automation.  The proposed                    
              instrument exceeds current equipment ability in sensitivity,                   
              temperature control, and computer control.  The system will be used            
              by four faculty members of the Physics and Chemistry departments               
              for fundamental materials research, and will aid in training of                
              undergraduates and graduate students (20), and postdocs (3).                   
                                                                                             
              The SQUID magnetometer is a central measurement and                            
              characterization apparatus for several projects:  measurement of               
              magnetic properties of ultrafine parcticles prepared via novel                 
              synthetic techniques having unique compositions and structures;                
              studies of storage and relaxation processes of photoexcited charge             
              carriers in II-VI mixed crystals and related critical phenomena;               
              studies of magnetic anisotropy and interface exchange in                       
              multilayers of rare-earth metals and transition metals and their               
              oxides and studies of critical phenomena in these systems; and                 
              measurements of organic ferromagnets.//
