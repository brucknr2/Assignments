Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Carl Heiles will continue his wide ranging investigations of               
              the diffuse interstellar medium primarily using radio astronomical             
              techniques.  He will continue extensive observations of Zeeman                 
              splitting of the 21-cm neutral hydrogen line, concentrating on                 
              extensive maps of interesting regions; attempt the measurement of              
              linear polarization of the 18-cm lines of hydroxyl; study the                  
              morphology and kinematics of large interstellar shells and                     
              supershells by detailed mapping of the 21-cm line and diffuse radio            
              recombination lines; investigate the fundamental topology of the               
              neutral interstellar medium by intensive analysis of existing data;            
              perform a blind search for anomalous velocity features, such as may            
              be due to rapidly expanding shells; investigate the global                     
              properties of the diffuse radio recombination line emission and the            
              Warm Ionized Medium by performing a large survey in the Galactic               
              plane; perform a comprehensive and detailed investigation of                   
              globules in ionized hydrogen regions by using both molecular and               
              optical emission lines; confirm a possible detection of the 327 MHz            
              line of deuterium; and launch a search for the 310 MHz lines of                
              deuterated hydroxyl.
