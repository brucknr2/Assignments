Abstract    :
              Methane gas hydrates may occur wherever methane and water exist in             
              close proximity at low temperatures and elevated pressures.  These             
              hydrates are thought to be widespread in both on-shore permafrost              
              regions of the North American and Soviet Arctic and in the shallow             
              continental shelves of the Arctic Ocean where sub-sea permafrost is            
              found.  Methane gas may be released to the atmosphere because of               
              hydrate destabilization as a result of climatic warming and changes            
              in sea level.  With present knowledge, it is not possible to                   
              predict the timing or the amount of methane that would be released             
              by gas hydrate decomposition as a result of permafrost, especially             
              sub-sea permafrost, degradation during interglacial periods.                   
                                                                                             
              We proposed to modify a two-dimensional model of climate-permafrost            
              interaction.  The model will be applied to several sites in North              
              America and in the Soviet Union to elevate the potential for gas               
              hydrate and permafrost occurrence and degradation in response to               
              changes in climate and sea level.  This information will be used               
              (in collaboration with USGS and Soviet investigators) to make                  
              improved estimates of the possible fluxes of methane onto the                  
              atmosphere as a result of hydrate and permafrost degradation.
