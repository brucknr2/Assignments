Abstract    :
              It is generally agreed that there                                              
              is a better than 50% chance that a                                             
              very severe earthquake will strike                                             
              somewhere in the United States                                                 
              within the next thirty years.  The                                             
              vulnerability of the eastern                                                   
              portion of North America is of                                                 
              particular concern.  Since very few                                            
              structures in the East have been                                               
              designed for earthquakes, and there                                            
              are more tall buildings in the East                                            
              than in the West, the subject is                                               
              very urgent.
