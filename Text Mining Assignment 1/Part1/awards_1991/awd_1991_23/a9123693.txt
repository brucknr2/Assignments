Abstract    :
                   A two-day symposium on the status of research concerning the              
              invariance of physical systems with respect to T (time) and CP                 
              (charge-parity) reversal will be held at the University of                     
              Michigan on October 25 and 26, 1991.  The meeting will bring                   
              together theorists and experimentalists from atomic physics, high              
              energy physics, astrophysics, and nuclear physics, to discuss                  
              current progress and future prospects for observing T-violation.               
              The conference proceedings will be published and are expected to               
              constitute a definitive statement on the status of this field.
