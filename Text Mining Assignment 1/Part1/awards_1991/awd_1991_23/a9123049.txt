              Program Summary:                                                               
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data.  This proposal from Bermuda Biological                  
              Station (BBS) Research Institute requests funding for equipment                
              that will be used to support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the            
              R/V WEATHERBIRD II, a vessel that is owned and operated by the                 
              Institute.
