Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with developing a model of natural                   
              language understanding in which the inference machinery is based               
              on discourse principles.  In particular, a theory of text                      
              interpretation is develop.  This theory computers an                           
              interpretation that conforms to plausible goals of a speaker and               
              is most likely to be intended given the utterances than any other              
              interpretation.  The system is implemented by postulating an                   
              access/selection.integration paradigm.  It is allowed for                      
              probabilistic considerations to be compiled into how elements are              
              indexed, rather than exist as part of a run-time mechanism.
