Abstract    :
              This award will support the travel of young U.S. faculty                       
              researchers in the area of robotics to attend an International                 
              Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) to be held                   
              during November, 1991, in Osaka, Japan.  Professor Daniel E.                   
              Koditschek, Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University,             
              is the U.S. organizer.  He is cooperating with a number of                     
              Japanese researchers at university, government and corporate                   
              laboratories who have agreed to serve as hosts for the U.S.                    
              researchers.  At the conclusion of the Workshop each host institute            
              will sponsor a day long site visit and lecture by a U.S. researcher            
              at their facility.  In addition to attending the regular IROS                  
              Workshop sessions the young researchers will also attend several               
              special sessions in which they have been accepted to present their             
              papers.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The area of science is very important in both countries.  All the              
              organizers are well-known and capable.  The IROS Workshop will                 
              provide the U.S. researchers the opportunity of interacting with               
              Japan's most powerful university, corporate and academic leaders               
              in the robotics area.  Since research in the robotics area has                 
              recently slowed in the U.S. it is important to be increasingly aware           
              of the advances currently underway in Japanese research                        
              establishments.  The Workshop should also offer the U.S.                       
              researchers a unique opportunity for pursuing research ties with               
              Japanese scientists in an attempt to facilitate long-term                      
              collaboration, to the mutual benefit of both the U.S. and Japan.
