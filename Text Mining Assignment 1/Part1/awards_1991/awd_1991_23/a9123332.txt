Abstract    :
                   This grant supports theoretical and experimental research                 
              in nuclear structure physics.  Its focus will be on shell                      
              model calculations for light and medium mass nuclei far from                   
              the valley of stability, particularly those which might                        
              optimally be studied with radioactive beam experiments.
