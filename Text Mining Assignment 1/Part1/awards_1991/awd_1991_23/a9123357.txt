Abstract    :
              Evergreen State College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via             
              a 56,000 bits per second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level               
              network.  The connection enhances collaborations of campus                     
              researchers with colleagues in several fields such as biology,                 
              psychology, computer science and music, and enables on-line access             
              to remote bibliography databases and supercomputers.  This award               
              funds part of the costs for two years.
