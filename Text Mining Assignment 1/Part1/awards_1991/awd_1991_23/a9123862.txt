Abstract    :
                   Quinto will pursue problems in the mathematical analysis of               
              Radon transforms and in tomography with two major objectives.                  
              The first is to prove injectivity and support theorems for                     
              generalized radon transforms in the setting of real analytic                   
              measures on real analytic submanifolds.  The second is to solve                
              two problems in tomography. Namely, the non-destructive                        
              evaluation of rings and rocket exit cones, and a dose plan                     
              algorithm for cancer radiation therapy.                                        
                   The mathematics in this project is as follows.  Take a                    
              manifold (surface, solid, or higher dimensional analogue) and a                
              function defined on it.  Suppose the manifold is sliced up in                  
              some fashion and the average of the function over each slice is                
              known.  The problem is to reconstruct the original function.  A                
              good example is the function that gives the density at each point              
              of a solid body whose inside is not directly accessible .  X-ray               
              images give average densities along lines in the direction of the              
              beam.  Tomography is the science of deducing densities inside the              
              object from an economical number of these images.
