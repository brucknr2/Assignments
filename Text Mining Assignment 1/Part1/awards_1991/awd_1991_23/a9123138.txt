Abstract    :
              The primary purpose of the workshop is to bring together leading               
              scientists from academia, industry, and government agencies to                 
              discuss the role of large-scale computing in Theoretical                       
              Structural Biology and to discuss the formation of a Grand                     
              Challenge Group in response to the High Performance Computing and              
              Communications Initiative.  The scientific focus of the workshop               
              will be on structure/function aspects of biological                            
              macromolecules and their relationships to high performance                     
              computing.  The subjects to be discussed are:                                  
              1)  structure determination and the protein folding problem;                   
              2)  molecular recognition and drug design;                                     
              3)  catalysis, i.e., enzyme reaction mechanisms and                            
              electron/proton transfer processes.  This workshop will also                   
              allow graduate students and post-doctoral researchers an                       
              opportunity to meet the leading scientists in the field and to                 
              become acquainted with the future development in Structural                    
              Biology.
