Abstract    :
              A direct electromagnetic generation of ultrasound techniques is                
              used to study precursor effects in the velocity and attenuation in             
              Nickel-Aluminum alloys near the martensitic phase transformation               
              temperature.  This technique probes not only the bulk but also the             
              surface of the materials and will yield valuable information about             
              both the interaction of phonons and the strain fields associated               
              with the defects which cause the transformation.  The variation of             
              the elastic constants with hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure will              
              e measured in order to determine the conditions for lattice                    
              stability in these alloys.  Additional studies with collaborators              
              will employ neutron diffraction work to further characterize the               
              structure of single crystals used in the research project.
