Abstract    :
                   Continuing research on the mathematical theory of inverse                 
              problems in partial differential equations will be supported by                
              this award.  The principal mathematical ingredient of the work is              
              the so-called Dirichlet to Neumann map: The boundary values of a               
              partial differential equation are given, the solution is                       
              established and its normal derivative at the boundary is then                  
              given.  The relationship between the boundary values and the                   
              normal derivative is  established.  One of the primary issues                  
              concerns the invertibility of the map and the regularity of the                
              inverse when it does exist.  In the physical world it is often                 
              much easier to measure the normal derivative - flux - than to                  
              know much about the boundary values or the values of the solution              
              within its region of definition.  This type of problem occurs in               
              impedance tomography where one attempts to measure internal                    
              resistivity in a body from measurements of voltage and current at              
              the boundary.                                                                  
                   Progress to date includes a variety of necessary conditions               
              for invertibility, but no good sufficient conditions are                       
              available without the presence of symmetry assumptions.  Better                
              results have been achieved in dimensions greater than two.  The                
              two dimensional tomography problem and anisotropic cases (which                
              can occur in geophysics) are important challenges.
