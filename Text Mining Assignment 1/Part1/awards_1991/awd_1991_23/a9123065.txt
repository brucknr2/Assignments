Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will provide a computer automated, zero-field AC-                 
              susceptometer with four probe AC-resistivity and a I Tesla                     
              superconducting solenoid, allowing magnetic phase diagram                      
              determinations of materials over moderate applied fields.  This                
              instrumentation will be used in a variety of new and continuing                
              research areas for which magnetic susceptibility and/or resistivity            
              measurements play a crucial role.  Specific projects include (A)               
              general characterization of high temperature cuprate                           
              superconductors, (B) field induced orientation of polycrystal                  
              mosaics of high Tc superconductors, (C) non-linearity and frequency            
              response of the magnetic behavior of high Tc superconductors, (D)              
              magnetism and transport properties of conductive organo-metallic               
              polymers based on valence averaged binuclear metal aggregates, (E)             
              low temperature zero field susceptibility and Ho vs T phase diagram            
              behavior of complex flourides of high spin Iron III.  This                     
              instrumentation is not presently available at Northeastern                     
              University.  It will be shared by faculty in the Chemistry and                 
              Physics departments, and will be made available to other users as              
              needed.
