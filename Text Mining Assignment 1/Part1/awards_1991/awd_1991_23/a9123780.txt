Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics will concern the physics                  
              of elementary particles and other topics.  Included will be                    
              novel mathematical approaches to string theory, studies aimed                  
              at selection of the "true" string theory from among many                       
              candidates, research on the physics of black holes, work on                    
              superfluidity, efforts to understand the origin of the masses                  
              of quarks and electron- like particles, and studies of quantum                 
              chromodynamics.                                                                
                   String theories are promising candidates for a theory of                  
              all the basic forces, including gravity.  The origin of the                    
              masses of the quarks and related particles is one of the                       
              outstanding problems in physics.  Quantum chromodynamics is                    
              the (not-too-well-understood) theory of the strong nuclear                     
              force.
