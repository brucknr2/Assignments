Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a 3 year cooperative modeling                     
              program involving the University of Washington (UW) and the Ohio               
              State University (OSU).  Each research team will focus on a                    
              complementary part of the ice modeling program, UW on derivation               
              of paleoclimate forcing on the ice flow, and OSU on the                        
              development of ice fabric and hardness variations which must be                
              known before adequate models can be constructed.  Formal inverse               
              techniques will be used to derive the rheological parameters, and              
              the climate forcing histories.  Ice core and borehole data will                
              also be used to test the model.
