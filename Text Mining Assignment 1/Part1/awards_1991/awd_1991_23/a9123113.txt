Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides funds to purchase plant growth chambers to                 
              aid plant biology research on the campus of University of                      
              California at Davis.  This is part of the UCD plan to totally                  
              upgrade their obsolete plant growth facilities, to which UCD                   
              committed substantial resources.                                               
                                                                                             
              Research areas of the UCD faculty members who are users of the                 
              plant growth facilities range from plant cell and molecular                    
              biology, developmental biology, population genetics and                        
              evolution, plant physiology, environmental biology and plant-                  
              microbe interactions.  The new facilities will also enhance                    
              graduate student training in the area of plant biology at UCD.
