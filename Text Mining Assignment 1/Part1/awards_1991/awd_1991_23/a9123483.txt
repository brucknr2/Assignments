Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal supports the acquisition of a parallel computer                  
              capable of operating in both Single Instruction, Multiple Data mode            
              and Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data mode.  The computer will be            
              used to support research in operating systems, scientific                      
              computing, parallel algorithms, VLSI design, and logic programming.            
              Collaborations with other departments, particularly with                       
              computational physics and chemistry, will also be enabled by the               
              acquisition of this computer.
