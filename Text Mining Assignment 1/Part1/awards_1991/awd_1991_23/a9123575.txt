Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his research on                  
              large deviation analysis of stochastic systems.  In particular                 
              his work will deal with applications to queueing networks, which               
              will give insight into the behavior of the new high performance                
              computing networks and very large multiprocessor systems that are              
              covered by the HPCC initiative.                                                
                   The principal investigator will continue his research in                  
              probability.  In particular he will be looking at applications                 
              which deal with computing networks.  This research has relevance               
              to the High Performance Computing and Communications initiative.
