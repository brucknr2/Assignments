Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Divergent views of the probabilities of the same events are studied            
              in this grant.  Concentrating on two historians of the Sacco-                  
              Vanzetti case with different views, we study how each of them                  
              structures the evidence in the case.  We obtain from each of them              
              their probabilities of each of the events of interest.  Using these            
              results, their views can be compared quantitatively to answer such             
              questions as whether the divergence in opinions is due to differing            
              opinions about the importance of certain key evidence, whether                 
              certain evidence is viewed identically by both, and whether other              
              evidence, although viewed differently, is considered irrelevant by             
              both.  The goal of the project is explore how to compare divergent             
              views of the same events, and to see how successfully probabilities            
              can be used to convey opinions about historical events.
