Abstract    :
                   Determining possible responses of Arctic ecosystems to                    
              global warming requires an understanding of both the past and                  
              present tundra communities.  Although the distribution and                     
              composition of modern North American tundra communities are                    
              relatively well documented, the late-Quaternary history of their               
              development remains poorly known.  This award supports an                      
              examination of the paleovegetation and paleoclimate of far                     
              northern Alaska over the last 18,000 years as a means of                       
              improving our knowledge of terrestrial-climate system                          
              interactions in Low Arctic settings.  This research, as part of                
              the PALE initiative, will analyze lake sediments from a suite of               
              sites located in 4 tundra types of the Alaska North Slope.  This               
              work will concentrate on calibrating modern pollen, moss spores,               
              and lignin compounds with surrounding vegetation and climatic                  
              parameters to assess their ability to accurately reconstruct past              
              environments and will apply these calibrations to a set of fossil              
              records chosen during the modern sampling.  The proposed research              
              addresses the goals of PALE by describing the late-Quaternary                  
              history of a poorly know Low Arctic region, by calibrating                     
              paleoenvironmental indicators, and by increasing the resolution                
              of lake records for defining variations within tundra                          
              environments.
