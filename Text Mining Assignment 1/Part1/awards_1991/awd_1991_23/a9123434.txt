Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              To make intelligent, cost effective decisions on ways of                       
              reducing industrial water-polluting emissions, for water                       
              remediation, and for estimating the fate, transport and                        
              bioaccumulation of chemicals, pure component thermodynamic                     
              properties and aqueous solution phase equilibrium data are                     
              needed.  The measurement of necessary experimental data and,                   
              more importantly, the development of methods to make accurate                  
              predictions of phase behavior in the absence to experimental                   
              data for such systems are the subjects of this program.                        
                                                                                             
              In particular, this program will attempt the measurement of                    
              phase equilibria (solubility and infinite dilution activity                    
              coefficients) of aqueous solutions of actual and model                         
              priority water pollutant chemicals, and the development of a                   
              new generation of group contribution prediction methods for                    
              such compounds.  An important characteristic of these                          
              chemicals is their complex, multifunctional nature.  The                       
              behavior of such molecules is not accurately predicted by                      
              current molecular thermodynamic models and, even worse, one                    
              must concerned above their appearance in water, a hydrogen-                    
              bonding solvent.  As an important part of this research, the                   
              investigators will use experimental data (to be measured in                    
              the project and obtained from the literature) and modern                       
              computational chemistry (molecular orbital) methods and                        
              molecular thermodynamic models to develop a new group                          
              contribution prediction procedure for multifunctional                          
              chemicals in aqueous solution.
