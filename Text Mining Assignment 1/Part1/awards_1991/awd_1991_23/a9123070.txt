Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop methods for                             
              manipulating cell behavior in three-dimensional gels.                          
              This is to be achieved by a systematic study of changes in                     
              cell behavior for human leukocytes and PC12 cells                              
              dispersed within collagen gels.  Specifically, cell                            
              behavior (i.e. motility and neurite outgrowth) in collagen                     
              gels with different hydration, cell behavior in collagen                       
              gels with added extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and                     
              cell behavior in gels with added biological response                           
              modifiers will be examined.  By using controlled release                       
              polymers as sources of bioactive agents (antibodies,                           
              growth factors, chemotactic factors,and ECM molecules),                        
              cell behavior in well characterized concentration                              
              gradients is also to be quantified.
