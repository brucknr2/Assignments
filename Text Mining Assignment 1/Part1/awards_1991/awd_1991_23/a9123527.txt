Abstract    :
                   Computer aided geometric design is the design and                         
              representation of curves, surfaces, and volumes in an interactive              
              computer graphics environment.  This project focuses on design and             
              will include work in two areas:  (1) geometry processing and (2)               
              nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS).                                         
                   Geometry processing is the calculation of geometric properties            
              of curves and surfaces.  NURBS are becoming a de facto industry                
              standard for geometry representation because both polynomials and              
              conics can be represented exactly.  Both areas are of prime                    
              importance in many fields such as computer aided design/computer               
              aided manufacturing.  Both areas also have considerable theoretical            
              interest as well.  Research subtopics under these two principal                
              headings include the following:  (1) surface/surface                           
              intersection, offset surfaces, surface triangulations and (2)                  
              curve and surface fairing, automatic weight generation for NURBS,              
              and the investigation of stabiblity issues associated with rational            
              shape representations.
