Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Local polymer dynamics in solution will be investigated using                  
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) relaxation measurements, time-                
              resolved optical experiments, and computer simulations.  NMR                   
              measurements will be used to investigate the nonlinear dependence              
              of local polymer motions upon the solvent viscosity in dilute                  
              solution.  These results will be combined with solvent rotation                
              measurements to test a new hypothesis about the origin of the                  
              solvent modification effect first noted in viscoelastic studies.               
              Both optical and NMR experiments will be used to systematically                
              explore the microscopic friction of polymer solutions on varying               
              length scales.  Computer simulations will provide new insights into            
              the fundamental nature of local polymer dynamics.  The cooperative             
              motion of torsional angles, atomic positions , and other degrees of            
              freedom will be examined.  The simulations can be critically tested            
              by the NMR measurements.  Together these studies will allow the                
              investigators to address the relationship between molecular                    
              structure and local dynamics, the interaction of solvent and                   
              polymer motions, and the connection between local and global                   
              polymer motions.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This research deals with a fundamental investigation of dynamic                
              properties of polymer molecules that are different from those found            
              in molecules of other materials.  Hence, the research is                       
              fundamental, but of potential significance in technology, (i.e.,               
              for viscosity and rubber elasticity).
