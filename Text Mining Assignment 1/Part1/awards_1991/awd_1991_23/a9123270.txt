Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support of the eighth in                  
              a series of conferences in January at the Aspen Center.  These                 
              conferences are given in three areas of physics, and the                       
              present award covers the area of elementary particle physics.                  
              Conferences in this series accommodate about 65 physicists                     
              both experimentalists and theorists.  The focus for the                        
              conference this year will be both on the virtually massless                    
              particles called neutrinos and on the heaviest particles which                 
              are expected to accompany them in the theory called the                        
              "standard model" which has so far been successful in                           
              explaining the most fundamental aspects of the forces of                       
              nature.  Any evidence for failures of this theory will be                      
              explored in this conference.
