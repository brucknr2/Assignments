Abstract    :
              This award will support an astronomical symposium entitled:                    
              "Massive Stars: Their Lives in the Interstellar Medium," to be                 
              held at the University of Wisconsin on June 23-25, 1991. These

              or invited speakers.  This symposium will focus on the star/                   
              interstellar medium interactions for massive stars and call                    
              attention to areas needing additional research.
