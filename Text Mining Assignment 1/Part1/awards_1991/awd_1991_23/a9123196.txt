Abstract    :
                   How the frequency of fires influences the relative                        
              abundance of tree species in south Florida tropical forests on                 
                                                                                             
              the mainland of the United States will be studied.  The                        
              stewardship of such  forests within Everglades National Park                   
              requires understanding how their composition may have been                     
              altered by an increased frequency of fire following the partial                
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              drainage of the Everglades in the last century.                                
                   Such questions can be answered by constructing a simple                   
              computer model in which the abundance of certain types of trees
