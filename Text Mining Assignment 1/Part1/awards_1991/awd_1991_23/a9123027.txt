Abstract    :
              Despite numerous studies of the biogenic component in Arctic deep-             
              sea sediments, several conflicting hypotheses exist concerning the             
              history of glaciations on the surrounding land-masses and ice-                 
              rafting events in the central Arctic Ocean.  This award supports               
              the analysis of lithic and heavy mineral particles and the                     
              reflected light petrography and microprobe composition of Fe-Ti                
              oxide grains to determine the history of ice-rafting events in                 
              sediment cores from the central Arctic Ocean and determine the                 
              sources for these sediments.  This approach has the real potential             
              to differentiate ice-rafting events in the Arctic Ocean and link               
              ice-rafted detritus to potential sources from the surrounding                  
              landmass and thus provide a definitive glacial history for the                 
              North American Arctic as well as a clearer paleoceanographic                   
              history of the central Arctic Ocean.  This ice-rafting history and             
              provenance of the Arctic Ocean is critical to our full                         
              understanding of Pleistocene paleoclimate and paleoceanography.
