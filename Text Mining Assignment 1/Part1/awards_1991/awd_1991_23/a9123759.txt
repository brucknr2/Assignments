Abstract    :
              This project involves combined                                                 
              experimental and analytical studies                                            
              of knee joints.  Approximately                                                 
              twenty knee joint specimens will be                                            
              designed, constructed, and                                                     
              subjected to simulated earthquake                                              
              loadings.  The primary parameters                                              
              of the testing program will be the                                             
              type of loading (monotonic or

              will involve the modification of a                                             
              mechanical model developed for                                                 
              interior joints for application to                                             
              knee joints.  The model to be                                                  
              developed for such joints will be

              will identify problem areas for
