Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research to be carried out in this grant will focus on                     
              observations of the interstellar medium (ISM) in nearby disk                   
              galaxies.  The research will address several unresolved issues in              
              our understanding of the interstellar medium.  It will address the             
              morphology of the neutral and ionized hydrogen gas and the                     
              dependence on Hubble type and star formation rates.  It will                   
              examine the role of diffuse ionized gas in the interstellar medium             
              and will study ionized gas regions (HII regions) that are located              
              high above the plane of the galaxy and far from its center.
