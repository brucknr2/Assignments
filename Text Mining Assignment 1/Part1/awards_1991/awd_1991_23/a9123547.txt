Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will continue spectrophotometric measurements with               
              the Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) spectrograph and direct imaging                
              camera of the emission line and continuous spectra of nebulae,                 
              Seyfert galaxies, radio galaxies, other active galactic nuclei, and            
              quasars.  Direct images will be taken with the CCD system through              
              various emission-line and continuum filters.  These measurements,              
              in conjunction with X-ray, radio, ultraviolet and infrared data                
              will be used to analyze the physical conditions in the ionized gas             
              in all types of active galactic nuclei.  Information on ionization,            
              abundances, temperatures and densities will be emphasized in this              
              research.  The internal velocity fields and energy-input mechanisms            
              will also be investigated.  These data, and their interpretation,              
              will add to our knowledge of the structure, nature, origin, and                
              evolution of active galactic nuclei.                                           
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world leader in this               
              field of research.
