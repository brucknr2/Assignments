Abstract    :
                   Recent advances in spatial analysis and related                           
              methodologies such as geographical information systems have                    
              pointed up the need for a better understanding of the statistical              
              properties of spatial correlation and autocorrelation.  Failure                
              to take spatial autocorrelation into account can lead to serious               
              errors in model interpretation.  Spatial modeling must not only                
              take account of dependence structure and heteroscedasticity, but               
              it must also assess the effects of spatial scale.  This research               
              focuses on a new family of spatial association statistics, G, by               
              experimentation on spatially distributed variables in different                
              situations, especially with small samples.  The ultimate                       
              objective is to incorporate the G statistics into geographical                 
              information systems in order to explore the influence of spatial               
              dependence and spatial heterogeneity on a variety of analytical                
              models.                                                                        
                   Geographers, geologists and econometricians, among others,                
              have used a variety of statistical techniques for measuring                    
              spatial association.  This research project will add a more                    
              powerful tool for the analysis of spatial distributions, because               
              of its direct application at a variety of spatial scales.                      
              Integration of the G statistics into geographical information                  
              systems will permit more rigorous analysis of spatial                          
              distributions at different levels of spatial aggregation, thus                 
              extending their utility to many different problems.
