Abstract    :
                   TCI software will develop transformations between the                     
              objects of a scientific word processor (Scientific Word) and the               
              objects of symbolic manipulation systems like Mathematica and                  
              Maple.                                                                         
                   The PI's firm, TCI software, has established credibility in               
              this area, and an award as a Phase 2 SBIR grantee is highly                    
              recommended.
