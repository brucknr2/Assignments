Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study isomonodromy                        
              deformation problems and their application to solve asymptotic                 
              connection formulae and to carry out a related study on the                    
              factorization problem associated with Gelfand-Dikii flows.  These              
              fundamental properties of integrable systems have been                         
              established for the 2 x 2 case, but have not been resolved for                 
              the general n x n case.  A geometrical-analytical understanding                
              is critical for further development.                                           
                   Integrable systems and inverse scattering problems play a                 
              fundamental role in establishing links between fundamental                     
              physics and the way in which mathematical models are used to                   
              describe it.
