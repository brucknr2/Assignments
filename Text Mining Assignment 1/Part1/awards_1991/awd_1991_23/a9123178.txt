Abstract    :
              This grant in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program is made to Dr. Michael P. Castellani of the Chemistry                  
              Department, Marshall University.  Pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl                  
              complexes of (1) chromium and iron phosphines and isocyanides                  
              and of (2) zirconium (IV) oxides and sulfides, and related                     
              niobium and tantalum hydrides, will be prepared.  Reactivity of                
              the electron-deficient radical species produced is expected to                 
              be reduced by the introduction of the bulky pentaphenyl-                       
              cyclopentadienyl group.  These compounds are of interest                       
              because they serve as models for radical intermediates that                    
              have been proposed for many catalytic and organometallic                       
              reactions.  Once prepared, the catalytic activity and                          
              mechanisms of substitution reactions of these compounds will be                
              explored and implications for analogous reactions drawn.                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Highly reactive species important in catalytic processes are                   
              not easily characterized, but this project allows determination                
              of the reactivity of closely-related species.  The findings                    
              have implications for catalyst development and sensor                          
              technology.  The research will be carried out by undergraduate                 
              students.
