Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data.  This proposal from the University of                   
              Miami/RSMAS requests funding for equipment that will be used to                
              support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V's ISELIN, a 170'            
              vessel, and CALANUS, a 64' vessel.  The two vessels are owned and              
              operated by the University.  They provide extensive support to NSF             
              funded oceanographic research projects.
