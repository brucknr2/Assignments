Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                
              metallic Chemistry Program, will undertake the synthesis and                   
              characterization of new examples of carbon and nitrogen acids                  
              that have very high acidities as a result of substitution by                   
              perfluoroalkylsulfonyl groups.  The conjugate bases of these                   
              acids are predicted to be highly stable and to have very low                   
              nucleophilicities.  In a second area, metal salts of these                     
              strong acids, both monoprotic and polyprotic, will be prepared                 
              and their solid state structures determined by x-ray                           
              crystallography.  Preliminary studies indicate that such                       
              derivatives are likely to have layered or zeolitic structures                  
              with potentially useful applications.  Finally, in a                           
              continuation of earlier NSF-funded research, further studies of                
              the fluorination of organic compounds by fluorobis(polyfluoro-                 
              alkylsulfonyl)amines will be undertaken along with efforts to                  
              develop larger scale syntheses of this class of compounds.

              The high electron withdrawing capability of fluorine as a                      
              substituent results in very unusual properties for its                         
              compounds.  At the same time introduction of fluorine into many                
              compounds, and organic compounds in particular, is difficult                   
              because of the highly reactive nature of the element and many                  
              of the reagents used for this purpose.  This project will                      
              undertake further fundamental studies of the synthesis and                     
              properties of highly fluorinated materials.  Potential uses for                
              the new compounds to be synthesized include ionic conductors,                  
              catalysts, and high temperature electrolytes.
