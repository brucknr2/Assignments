Abstract    :
                   This grant will support the improvement of the insect                     
              collections at Ohio State, in conjunction with OSU's development of            
              a "Museum of Biological Diversity", a renovated facility to house              
              its biological collections.  The OSU insect collection, with about             
              3.5 million specimens and over 2500 primary types, is the 14th                 
              largest in North America and fifth largest among those at                      
              U.S. universities.  Geographic coverage is worldwide; taxonomic                
              strengths are the Homoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera.              
              The collection, now scattered among five rooms, will be consolidated           
              in the new facility in a climate controlled area that is twice as              
              large as the current collection area, thus allowing for future                 
              growth.  New cabinets will alleviate current crowding, allow for               
              expansion and will replace wooden cabinets, which are inadequate for           
              housing the collection or protecting it against pests.                         
              Institutional commitments include provision of the new collection              
              area and a promise to make a collection manager position permanent             
              after the expiration of the project.  These collections are an                 
              extremely important, international resource for systematic,                    
              biodiversity and ecological studies on arthropods, and play a strong           
              role in the training of students in entomological research.                    
              This project will make the OSU collection more accessible to the               
              scientific community and further its use in research and education             
              on the biology of insects.
