Abstract    :
                   The award will provide partial support for an                             
              International conference to consider questions regarding the                   
              interactions of very high energy cosmic rays with the Earth's                  
              atmosphere.  The focus of the conference will be on all types                  
              of cosmic ray showers observed in a large variety of different                 
              detectors, including photographic emulsions and other                          
              electronic particle detector devices.  Fundamental questions                   
              regarding both astrophysics and particle physics are addressed                 
              by data which are likely to be presented.  In astrophysics,                    
              the sources and the genders of cosmic rays as well as the                      
              acceleration mechanisms resulting in their high energies are                   
              of profound interest.  In particle physics, the nature of the                  
              high energy interactions with the atmosphere are important,                    
              and can be related to data from the world's highest energy                     
              accelerator - the Tevatron collider at Fermilab - from which                   
              data should also be presented at the conference.  The                          
              conference is seventh in a bi-annual series, and is sponsored                  
              by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics                         
              (IUPAP).
