Abstract    :
                   Understanding the reasons for the location and timing of the              
              onset of convective weather is a fundamental research question and             
              important to the forecasting of weather.  Convergence along                    
              mesoscale atmospheric boundaries and topographic effects are                   
              primary mechanisms for convective cloud initiation and development             
              and in determining the distribution of precipitation.  The                     
              availability of data from recent field research experiments and                
              advances in numerical computer model capabilities provide an                   
              opportunity to advance knowledge of these processes.                           
                   The Principal Investigator will use data collected from recent            
              field programs to initialize and verify an advanced atmospheric                
              numerical model.  He will examine the contributions, interactions              
              and sensitivities of the physical processes leading to convective              
              storm development along atmospheric boundaries.  He also will                  
              examine the influence of topography on the development and                     
              organization of clouds and precipitation.
