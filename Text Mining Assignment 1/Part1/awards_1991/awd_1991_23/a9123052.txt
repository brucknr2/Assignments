Abstract    :
                   This study will quantitatively examine the contribution to                
              seed dispersal and seedling establishment of understory shrub                  
              species by fruit-eating birds in a Costa Rican wet lowland                     
              forest.                                                                        
              Detailed data will be collected on the distribution, fruiting                  
              phenology and seed germination and seedling establishment                      
              requirements of two species of shrubby Melastomatacea and of                   
              Rubiaceae, both dominant families in the understory at the site.               
                                                                                             
              These data will be combined with dietary and behavioral data of                
              three species of understory frugivorous birds into a model to                  
              quantify seedling establishment of each plant species as a result              
                                                                                             
              of dispersal by each bird species.  Populations of the four shrub              
                                                                                             
              species will be studied using standard measurement and phenology               
                                                                                             
              methods, and also through quantification of light environments by              
                                                                                             
              hemispherical canopy photographs and field germination and                     
              seedling                                                                       
              survival trials.  Bird populations will be studied by direct                   
              observation of color-banded birds, fecal sample analysis, and                  
              radio-tracking individuals of each species throughout the year.                
                                                                                             
              The combination of plant and bird data into a mathematical model               
                                                                                             
              represents the first time that this approach has been applied to               
                                                                                             
              a lowland understory system.  Because of the difficulty or                     
              impossibility of following the fates of individual seeds                       
              dispersed                                                                      
              from an understory plant, this model will provide a powerful tool              
                                                                                             
              for quantifying interactions between understory plants and
