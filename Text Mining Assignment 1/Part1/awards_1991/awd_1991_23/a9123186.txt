Abstract    :
              Theoretical work and software simulation indicate the potential to             
              use light to change transistor threshold values.  By this technique            
              a circuit can be placed into a mode ready for testing, with all                
              switching devices activated to the same voltage level.  In this                
              research, the logical and electrical behavior of MOS transistors               
              as the optical effect changes threshold values is being studied.               
              Also being studied are changes in the electrical properties of                 
              switching devices (inverters and transmission gates) due to optical            
              effects.  Experiments on fabricated devices to determine if a                  
              stable optical threshold control can be designed are being                     
              performed.  Also being investigated are methods of detecting the               
              presence of defects through changes in signals at the output lines.
