Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports Professor Nancy Kleckner of                                
              Harvard College and her graduate student, Ruth                                 
              Padmore, M.D., to collaborate in molecular                                     
              biology research with Professor Christa Heyting                                
              and others of the Department of Genetics of the                                
              Agricultural University of Wageningen, The                                     
              Netherlands.  Both of these laboratories are                                   
              interested in understanding the mechanisms of                                  
              and relationships between chromosome pairing and                               
              recombination during meiosis.  However the two                                 
              laboratories have used very different approaches                               
              and very different organisms for their analysis,                               
              yeast and rats.  The overall scientific goal of                                
              the collaboration is a comparative analysis of                                 
              the processes of interest in the two organisms.                                
              The complementary skills of the two research                                   
              groups in yeast molecular genetics and mammalian                               
              cell biology and cytogenetics should accelerate                                
              progress in both laboratories.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction.                                  
              One of the most important aspects of meiosis is                                
              the pairing of and recombination between                                       
              homologous chromosomes.  The general goal of                                   
              this collaboration is a functional comparison of                               
              these processes in yeast and higher eukaryotes.                                
              Most work on the genetics of meiosis has been                                  
              done with yeast, while most work on the cytology                               
              of meiosis is done with mammals.  It is                                        
              important but difficult to relate the two lines                                
              of research.
