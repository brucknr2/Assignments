Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is clear that massively parallel computers offer the best path              
              to the supercomputers of the future.  Unfortunately, they are                  
              very difficult to program efficiently due to the lack of compiler              
              support for the high level languages that exist.  The research                 
              undertaken in this proposal will focus on one such language,                   
              Fortran 90, with the intent of providing techniques to enhance                 
              compilation for distributed memory computers.  Fortran 90 offers               
              two advantages:  a rich set of array operations that enable the                
              programmer to address complex applications, and a language that,               
              as an extension of Fortran 77, is familiar to the broad                        
              scientific community.  The research will focus on three key                    
              compilation problems:  automatic array alignment, parameterized                
              data layout, and generation of collective communications.                      
              Emphasis will be placed on the development of general principles               
              of compilation and the generation of efficient code.
