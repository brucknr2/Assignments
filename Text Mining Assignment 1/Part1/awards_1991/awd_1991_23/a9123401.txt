Abstract    :
              This is an award to support a project to study issues in                       
              public awareness that impact on components of the urban                        
              infrastructure that are concerned with water supply and                        
              distribution, wastewater collection and treatment, and                         
              management of stormwater.  Special emphasis in this                            
              project is on those components of the urban infrastructure                     
              that impact directly on environmental and public health in                     
              contrast to a similar project being conducted with support                     
              from the Structures and Building Systems Program in the                        
              Engineering Directorate's Division of Mechanical and                           
              Structural Systems that will concentrate on structures                         
              such as roads, bridges and buildings.                                          
                                                                                             
              Results of this project are expected to provide a basis                        
              for determination of research needs that may be utilized                       
              for program planning purposes.  The three undergraduate                        
              students who will be working on this project are:  James                       
              A. Dowd II, James Geiger, and Deborah M. Sana.
