Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his research on the              
              quantitative aspects of geometric convexity. In particular he                  
              will study the Brunn-Minkowski theory of mixed volumes which is                
              at the core of quantitative convexity.                                         
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              integral geometry. The geometry of a set may often be analyzed                 
              and described by a decomposition of the set into slices. The                   
              geometry of the slices is often fairly simple and easy to                      
              describe. The main difficulty in the analysis is usually the                   
              reconstruction of the underlying geometric features of the entire              
              set from the geometry of the slices. One well known application                
              of this area of mathematics is the CAT scan.
