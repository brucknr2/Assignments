Abstract    :
              Shragowitz         In this research fuzzy logic is being applied to reasoning 
              about problems of VLSI physical design and printed circuit boards  (PCB).  This
              includes identification of important factors for  each problem, selection of
              linguistic variables, formulation of  the membership functions for linguistic
              values in fuzzy sets and  formulation of the decision rules.  A fuzzy logic
              model of  timing-driven placement, where area, timing, and routability may 
              become conflicting goals is being developed.  This model  incorporates timing
              analysis and prediction, especially pre-  layout prediction of path and net
              criticality, and weight  functions for nets in computation of timing bounds.  A
              second  fuzzy logic model for placement of cells on a VLSI chip in the 
              presence of conflicting goals is being developed.  The model is  being adapted
              to PCB placement, taking into account parameters  such as connectivity, timing,
              transmission line effects,  routability, and thermal impact.    Experiments
              with the  algorithms on benchmark circuits are being performed.
