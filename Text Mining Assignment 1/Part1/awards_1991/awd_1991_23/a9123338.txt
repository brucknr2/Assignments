Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award from the U.S.- Argentina Cooperative                                
              Science Program supports research in chemistry                                 
              to be conducted by Dr. Harold A. Scheraga of                                   
              Cornell University and Dr. Jorge Vilas of the                                  
              Institute of Applied Mathematics (IMASL),                                      
              National Research Council of Argentina                                         
              (CONICET), Argentina.  The main goal of the work                               
              is to understand the physical origin of the                                    
              relationship between the amino-acid sequence and                               
              the stability of alpha-helices in small peptides                               
              at different pH's and temperatures.                                            
                                                                                             
              The project will combine two approaches, namely                                
              molecular mechanics calculations and statistical                               
              mechanics theory.  Statistical mechanics                                       
              incorporates the information obtained by                                       
              molecular mechanics in order to predict the most                               
              stable conformations of both new copolypeptide                                 
              sequences and more complex systems.  The                                       
              numerous experimental observations on short                                    
              peptides that are available from both NMR and CD                               
              measurements  will be used in concert with the                                 
              proposed analysis to provide an understanding of                               
              the factors leading to helix stability, and a                                  
              reliable test of the empirical potentials used                                 
              to describe peptides and proteins. The project                                 
              involves two established experts in the field of                               
              molecular and statistical mechanics.  ***//
