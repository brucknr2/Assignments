Abstract    :
              This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project is in                
              the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                
              subfield of bioanalysis.  It is jointly supported by the Division              
              of Chemistry and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive             
              Research (EPSCoR) Office.  During the tenure of this three-year                
              continuing grant, Professor Asouzu and his students will develop               
              and study enzyme immunoassay methods and immunosensors.  The                   
              incorporation of avidin, streptavidin, biotin, and their enzyme                
              and antibody conjugates into immunoassays and immunosensor design              
              will be evaluated.  Enzymes and antibodies will be used in both                
              their solubilized and immobilized forms.  Enzyme immunoassay                   
              techniques will be combined with flow injection analysis and                   
              amperometric detection to develop a multi-antigen immunoassay                  
              method.                                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              This project includes a well-conceived, multi-step paradigm for                
              introducing undergraduate students, including freshmen, to                     
              applications of enzymes and enzyme kinetic methods for                         
              bioanalysis.  The research is expected not only to lead to new                 
              developments in this rapidly expanding field, but also to                      
              contribute strongly to the research and training infrastructure of             
              Troy State University and enable Professor Asouzu, a minority                  
              investigator, to initiate a competitive research program.
