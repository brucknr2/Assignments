Abstract    :
              This project is the continuation of an investigation of the                    
              transport of chemical trace elements and species from source                   
              regions through the atmosphere to the Greenland ice sheet.  Its                
              goal is to provide information for the interpretation of the trace             
              element distribution in a long ice core being obtained through the             
              Greenland Ice Sheet Program (GISP-2) drilling effort.  The ice core            
              is expected to provide a detailed record spanning 200,000 years.               
                                                                                             
              The project has three specific objectives: (1) the identification              
              of source regions and atmospheric pathways for the chemical                    
              constituents reaching the drill site, including the possible                   
              changes in air mass characteristics during transit, (2) the study              
              of the wet and dry deposition mechanisms and rates of incorporation            
              of chemical species into precipitating snow, and (3) the                       
              investigation of post-depositional changes in snow chemistry and of            
              the redistribution of species within the snowpack.  Field work                 
              consists of the collecting of air, aerosol, precipitation, and                 
              deposited snow samples, which will be analyzed for various anions              
              and cations, trace elements, carbon compounds, and trace gases.  A             
              special atmospheric camp, to ensure that samples will be                       
              uncontaminated by the drilling, is being maintained as part of the             
              GISP-2 program.
