Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                    This grant will support the computerization of the amphibian            
              reptile collection at the American Museum of Natural History                   
              (292,000 catalogued specimens) using MUSE, a collection database               
              originally designed with NSF support.  The AMNH herpetological                 
              collection ranks third or fourth in the world in number of                     
              specimens, taxonomic breadth (6000 species; over 520 holotypes)                
              and global geographic coverage.  Other holdings include frozen                 
              tissues, toxins, chromosome and histological preparations, and                 
              tape recordings of anuran vocalizations.   The collection is                   
              heavily used in teaching and research on biodiversity and                      
              environmental biology and is one the most important in the world               
              for systematic studies on amphibians and reptiles.                             
              Computerization will greatly increase the accessibility of                     
              collections and associated research data to research biologists.
