Abstract    :
              Regulation of mRNA translation constitutes an important aspect                 
              in the control of gene expression mammalian cells.  Most                       
              examples of translational control involve modulation of the                    
              initiation phase of protein synthesis.  Two kinds of initiation                
              events can be distinguished either of which may be regulated: 1)               
              initiation on polysomes, thereby maintaining a full complement                 
              of ribosomes on the mRNAs; and 2) initiation on messenger                      
              ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles, thereby mobilizing non-                    
              active mRNAs into active polysomes.  The latter event is                       
              poorly understand, yet its regulation is encountered                           
              frequently.  The PIs propose to characterize proteins that bind                
              to mRNP particles and that mask their activiies.  One such                     
              protein of 50 kDa has been purified in Pushchino, and its                      
              mechanism of action as a translational inhibitor will be                       
              probed.  Its site of binding to mRNAs will be determined, and                  
              the inhibited step of protein synthesis will be identified.                    
              They also plan to clone its cDNA and determine the effect of                   
              overexpression in transfected mammalian cells.  Preliminary                    
              evidence from Puschino suggests that the 50 kDa protein may                    
              itself be regulated by an "activator"; the "activator" will                    
              be purified and characterized.  These studies rely on classical                
              biochemical techniques of protein purification and chemistry                   
              presently used in both Davis and Puschino, employ in vitro                     
              cell-free translatiion systems, some highly fractionated and                   
              reconstituted with purified initiatiion factors from Davis, and                
              employ state-of-the-art transfection methods.                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              The project is designed to shed light on the basic molecular                   
              mechanisms of how mRNP particles are activated and inhibited                   
              for translation, and thus should help elucidate this major                     
              poorly understood area of gene regulation.
