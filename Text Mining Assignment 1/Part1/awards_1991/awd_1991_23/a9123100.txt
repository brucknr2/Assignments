Abstract    :
              This project involves the extension of Data Envelopment Analysis               
              (DEA) to situations involving stochastic inputs.  DEA is a                     
              techniques for combining variables which differ in their scale                 
              properties in order to produce decision functions.  DEA has been               
              applied to a wide range of processes including manufacturing                   
              productivity, audit of managerial performance, choice and                      
              location of unique facilities, hospital efficiency, branch bank                
              management, financial management, and marketing/sales efficiency.              
              The stochastic extensions of DEA are computationally intensive                 
              and computer software will be developed and tested to enable                   
              practical application of the procedures.
