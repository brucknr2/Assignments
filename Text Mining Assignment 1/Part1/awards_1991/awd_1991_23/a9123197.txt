Abstract    :
              Adsorption microcalorimetry is used to study the surface                       
              thermodynamics of supported platinum and platinum/tin                          
              catalysts for reactions of importance to the reformulation of                  
              gasoline, specifically dehydrogenation and isomerization of                    
              light paraffins.  Probe molecules are selected to study the                    
              chemical bonding properties of the surface for adsorbates                      
              relevant to the catalytic reactions of interest.  The                          
              enthalpic and entropic changes associated with the                             
              interactions of these probe molecules with surfaces are                        
              measured.  The surface thermodynamic data are compared with                    
              reaction kinetic data from steady-state studies, isotopic                      
              tracing, and temperature-programed desorption to explore                       
              correlations between surface thermodynamics and surface                        
              kinetics.  Relationships between surface thermodynamics and                    
              catalyst structure are also examined.                                          
                                                                                             
              This project is a major contribution to the data base on                       
              surface thermodynamics.  It also provides a good test of the                   
              utility of such data in catalyst design.  The test system                      
              employed has immediate implications in meeting the new                         
              standards under the Clean Air Act.
