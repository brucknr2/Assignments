Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting a project directed by Dr.                     
              Scheiner to investigate excited state proton transfer                          
              reactions.  Ab initio quantum mechanical methods are being used                
              to determine the potential functions of the excited states of                  
              some model systems and then a system containing an intra-                      
              molecular hydrogen bond.  Reaction rates and deuterium isotope                 
              effects are being computed.                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Proton transfer reactions involved in many enzyme-catalyzed                    
              biological processes have been extensively investigated by both                
              theoretical and experimental methods, but little is yet known                  
              regarding the nature of similar reactions between excited                      
              molecular states.  The potential energy surface of such excited                
              states may differ radically from that of the ground state and                  
              quite different kinetic behavior may follow.  Such systems are                 
              being investigated in the current project.
