Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The origin of the Antarctic radiolarian fauna and the extent to                
              which climate has influenced their evolution will be investigated.             
              To do this, the PI will extend previous investigations to high                 
              southern latitudes to detect Cenozoic high-latitude lineages.                  
              Also, she will investigate and document the evolutionary processes,            
              conduct high-resolution morphometric studies on radiolarian                    
              lineages, and construct an integrated high-low latitude taxonomy               
              and biostratigraphy.
