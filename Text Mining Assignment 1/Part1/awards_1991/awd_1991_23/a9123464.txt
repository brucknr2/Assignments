Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in                 
              communications and network security between Yvo Desmedt of the                 
              University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee and Michael Burmmester and                  
              Frederick Piper of the University of London.  The project is                   
              concerned with the possibility of communicating unintended secret              
              messages in multi-sender and multi-receiver networks.  The                     
              objective is to design secure communications and network systems               
              to protect against abuses in cryptographic protocols.  Dr. Desmedt             
              brings to this collaboration his background in theoretical computer            
              science and his understanding of practical issues in communication             
              network systems.  His recent research, in cooperation with the                 
              British investigators, has shown that a geometric approach to these            
              problems could be useful for developing abuse-free cryptosystems               
              and subliminal free authentication communication channels.  British            
              expertise in finite geometry and applications to multi-user network            
              security complements Dr. Desmedt's background.                                 
                                                                                             
              Multi-user network security is likely to grow in importance with               
              the development of large voice and data networks and their                     
              worldwide availability.  Information security and protection of                
              privacy are important issues in this area.  This project offers an             
              innovative geometric approach and possible solutions to these                  
              problems.
