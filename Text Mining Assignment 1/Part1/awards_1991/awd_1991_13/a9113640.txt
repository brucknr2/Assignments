Abstract    :
              This award supports a visit by Dr. Myron Charles Baker of                      
              Colorado State University to the University of Western                         
              Australia to work with Dr. Michael S. Johnson on behavioral                    
              and genetic components of the process by which new species                     
              are created in birds.  Behavioral studies of song recognition                  
              by several species of Australian birds (the Fairy Wren multi-                  
              species complex) will be carried out by playback                               
              experimentation in natural populations.  These results will                    
              form the basis for further investigations of features of the                   
              reproductive communication used in mate choice and will                        
              provide understanding of the differing degrees of divergence                   
              among the several species and subspecies.  The researchers                     
              will conduct genetic studies as an extension of an ongoing                     
              research program in North America.  Tissue samples from two                    
              closely-related species of buntings, and their hybrids, will                   
              be taken by Dr. Baker to a biochemical systematics laboratory                  
              at the University of Western Australia to be examined with                     
              enzyme and molecular techniques.  The results will address                     
              the question of the nature of gene exchange in a pair of                       
              species that may be in the process of completing their                         
              isolation as a new species.
