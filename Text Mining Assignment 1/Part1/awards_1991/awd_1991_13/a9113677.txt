Abstract    :
              This Grant for Exploratory Research in the Inorganic,                          
              Bioinorganic and Organometallic Program is awarded to Dr.                      
              Kristin B. Mertes of the Chemistry Department, University of                   
              Kansas, for work on metalloproteins.  Some of the work will be                 
              conducted at the California Institute of Technology.  A                        
              polyammonium macrocycle containing a 24-member ring will be                    
              used as a template for attaching peptide chains.  These chains                 
              consist of 14 residues and are expected to form in the desired                 
              motif, the 4-alpha-helical bundle.  Bimetallic centers of                      
              copper or manganese will be incorporated into the                              
              metalloproteins.  A luminescent ruthenium complex will be                      
              reacted with the imidazole of a terminal histidine, and a                      
              flash-quench technique will be used to investigate long-range                  
              electron transfer rates between ruthenium and the bimetallic                   
              centers.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              This project will study long-range electron transfer in a                      
              synthetic protein of known topology.  Since control of the                     
              topology of synthetic proteins is possible, this project will                  
              test the feasibility of investigating long-range electron                      
              transfer in polypeptides as a function of shape and distance.                  
              Since electron transfer of this sort is crucial to many                        
              biochemical reactions, this project is potentially relevant to                 
              the design of enzymes.
