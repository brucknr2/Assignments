Abstract    :
              While there is much conjecture regarding how jurors sort through               
              and order information in hearing evidence and making decisions,                
              there is only limited knowledge about what actually occurs and why.            
              Some of the best work that has sought to unravel how people reason             
              posits a story model to explain how jurors' judgments are reached.             
              To date, based on experimental study, the story model has generated            
              a compelling theory about how jurors understand evidence and make              
              decisions prior to deliberation in juries.  In contrast to additive            
              and algebraic models that posit that jurors add or average                     
              information to arrive at their decisions, the story model                      
              emphasizes explanation-based components of juror comprehension and             
              reasoning.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Dr. Pennington, who along with Dr. Hastie has pioneered the story              
              model, is now embarked on this next stage of the research.  The                
              current experimental program aims (1) to specify the process                   
              components of the theory by examining the inferences made during               
              the comprehension of evidence and the factors that influence which             
              inferences are made at what points in the comprehension process;               
              (2) to determine the relationship and interaction between                      
              processing stages proposed in the model--story construction,                   
              verdict learning, and story clarification--which have been assumed             
              to occur sequentially but might occur in a more repetitive cycling             
              fashion; and (3) to establish the robustness and boundaries of the             
              story model through the use of case materials less immediately                 
              susceptible to story construction.  The experiments are each labor-            
              intensive studies that use sophisticated methods to analyze the                
              micro processes of  decisionmaking.  The combined program should               
              advance our basic understanding of jury decisionmaking and of other            
              types of legal judgments such as accounts of disputes, litigant                
              perceptions of events, and attorney and judicial decisionmaking.               
              Also, this research should add to our general knowledge about the              
              cognitive mechanisms that mediate social processes and decisions.
