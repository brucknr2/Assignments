Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Tanko will                 
              examine the mechanism of decay of several cyclopropyl ketyl                    
              anions. In particular, questions that surround one potential                   
              mode of decomposition, i.e., a mechanism that proceeds via                     
              rapid and irreversible cyclopropane ring opening, will be                      
              addressed in this study. The potential use of these radical                    
              anion systems as "clocks" to measure the rates of competing                    
              bimolecular processes will be explored. Finally, potential                     
              applications of radical anions reactions to organic synthesis                  
              will be studied.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              Single electron transfer (SET) provides an important reaction                  
              pathway in organic chemistry. The species that are produced via                
              SET processes are called "radical anions". Their intermediacy                  
              in such reactions can be inferred by the appearance of                         
              rearranged products. Dr. Tanko has devised methodology for                     
              studying radical anion intermediates and for utilizing these                   
              intermediates as mechanistic probes to obtain detailed                         
              information about the mechanisms of competing reactions. In                    
              addition to their inherent mechanistic interest, radical anion                 
              reactions can be used to promote reactions that are likely to                  
              be useful for synthesizing structural units of important                       
              natural products.
