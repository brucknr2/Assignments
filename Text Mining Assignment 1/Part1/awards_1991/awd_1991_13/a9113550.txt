Abstract    :
              This study involves polymers which form glasses.  The techniques of            
              absolute volume dilatometry, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, and            
              Langmuir monolayer trough studies will be used to investigate glass            
              forming polymers.  Dilatometry and Differential Scanning                       
              Calorimetry will be used to examine the bulk glasses.  This will               
              involve isobaric temperature scans as well as volume recovery                  
              isotherms.  The same polymers will then be spread on a Langmuir                
              trough to form a glass-like structure at a free surface.  The                  
              glass-like monolayers will be studied using analogous experiments              
              to the bulk studies.  Measurements will include surface area vs                
              time isotherms at constant applied surface pressure and surface                
              area vs temperature studies at constant applied surface pressure.              
              The properties of polymer glasses confined to a surface are                    
              expected to be useful in a molecular interpretation of the glassy              
              state.
