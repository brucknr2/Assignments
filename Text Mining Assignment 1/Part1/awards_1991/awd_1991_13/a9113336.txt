Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During the first phase of this Small Business Research project,                
              ARACOR demonstrated the feasibility of the concept of using                    
              x-ray transmission anode films mounted on diamond substrates                   
              to enhance the brightness of x-ray sources.                                    
                                                                                             
              Phase II research will include: (i) the design, fabrication and                
              evaluation of select metal film/diamond heatsink structures to                 
              determine their performance under the protracted thermal and                   
              radiological stress of an intense microfocal x-ray source                      
              electron beam; (ii) studies to understand failure mechanisms,                  
              such as film delamination, diamond fracture, and radiation                     
              damage; and (iii) reliability and performance comparison tests of              
              the ARACOR reflection configuration targets relative to                        
              convential microfocus reflection targets.                                      
                                                                                             
              It is expected that the results of this research, if successful,               
              will have enormous impact on the international market for                      
              industrial x-ray imaging systems.
