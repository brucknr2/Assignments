Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides funds that will aid in the purchase of                     
              equipment to be used for research and training by a group of                   
              outstanding faculty at the University of Vermont.  The faculty's               
              research centers on studies of the evolutionary ecology of                     
              structured populations.  The general classes of questions                      
              addressed by the group include:  1) the ecological causes of                   
              population structure; 2) the effect of the structure on                        
              microevolutionary dynamics; 3) the (population) patterns to be                 
              expected in nature as a result of these dynamics.                              
              The interrelation of environment and evolution has been of                     
              interest since the earliest theories of evolution were proposed.               
              The role of population structure, as opposed to the simple size                
              of populations, has a relatively poorly understood role in the                 
              dynamics of evolution.  Studies of such structure require the                  
              analysis of characteristics of the DNA and protein of individual               
              members of animal and plant populations at the molecular level.                
              The equipment purchased with the aid of this award will be of                  
              benefit to faculty and student research in defining such                       
              characteristics.
