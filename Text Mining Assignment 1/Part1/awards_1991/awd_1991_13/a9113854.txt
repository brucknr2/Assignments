Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The relationship between democracy, markets, and economic growth               
              remains poorly understood by scholars despite the critical                     
              importance of these concepts both in social science theory and in              
              contemporary times.  Scholarly understanding of these concepts and             
              their relationships requires a combination of theoretical                      
              virtuosity, historical knowledge and methodological skill which few            
              possess.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This research training workshop will provide intensive training in             
              democratic theory and comparative methodologies to promising young             
              and mid-career scholars.  The workshops will conducted by some of              
              the leading scholars in the field whose diverse backgrounds and                
              interests will provide a rich learning environment for                         
              participants.  In addition to the training activities a principal              
              goal of the workshops is to assist participants in developing                  
              research ideas and proposals which might compete for NSF support               
              in the future.
