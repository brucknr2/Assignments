Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to evaluate the concept                      
              of using plasma torches that can effectively be operated in                    
              situ in a cased borehole surrounded by a geo-material                          
              medium. The plasma torch would be lowered to the bottom of                     
              a small diameter, cased borehole. By raising and operating                     
              the torch at progressively higher levels the borehole                          
              casing is rapidly melted opposite the plasma flame, and a                      
              column of soil (and/or a mixture of soil & waste) is heated                    
              and converted into a stabilized vertical mass. Successive                      
              (or simultaneous) operations in adjacent boreholes,                            
              properly spaced, would likewise stabilize an entire region.
