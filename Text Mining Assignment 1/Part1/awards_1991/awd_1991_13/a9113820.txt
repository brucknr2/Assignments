Abstract    :
              Since the late 1940s, the violent upheavals in the developing world            
              have generated a flood of political refugees variously estimated               
              as between 40 and 75 million people.  While politically induced                
              migrations have occurred throughout human history, the number of               
              political refugees appears to have reached an historical peak.                 
              This flow of refugees has important legal dimensions as this                   
              migration seems rooted in the increasing interdependence of the                
              world and the globalization of social and ethnic conflicts.                    
                                                                                             
              Dr. Jenkins seeks to address this issue through studying refugee               
              flows across a wide sample of national boundaries between 1955 and             
              1990.  The core of this work is a cross-national quantitative                  
              analysis of the social and political sources of the world-wide                 
              explosion in the number of political refugees.  Drawing on time                
              series and lagged-panel regression, the analysis will investigate              
              various hypotheses pertaining to the globalization of social                   
              conflicts that have been advanced to account for the growth and                
              intensity of the refugee problem.  By constructing an annualized               
              account of the initiation, intensity, and duration of refugee                  
              flows, the research will be able to illuminate the sources of civil            
              instability and the effects of instability, wars, famines, and                 
              facilitative conditions on refugee migrations.                                 
                                                                                             
              This study will substantially advance our understanding of the                 
              causes of refugee migration over the past several decades.  The                
              effort to construct and evaluate annual data on refugee migration              
              and populations for 152 countries for 35 years will be a valuable              
              scientific contribution in and of itself as is the development of              
              this data resource.  As important, however, is the relationship of             
              this project to recent theoretical developments.  In recent years,             
              theoretical attention has focused on refugee producing situations              
              and away from conceptualizing refugee migrations as idiosyncratic.             
              This work constitutes the first major test of such theoretical                 
              ideas.
