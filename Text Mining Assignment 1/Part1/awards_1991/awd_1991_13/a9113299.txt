Abstract    :
                   The PI plans to develop analytical methods for gaseous                    
              dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylsulfone (DMSO2) and to                    
              conduct exploratory measurements at a nearby coastal site.  His                
              objectives are to (1) use isotopic dilution to improve precision               
              and circumvent problems due to reactions in the trap and                       
              variability in sampling and analysis efficiencies, (2) desorb                  
              with supercritical fluid carbon dioxide to simplify the                        
              extraction process thus allowing automation, (3) improve                       
              detection limits to 0.3 pptv for 3 minute samples using a                      
              quadrupole mass spectrometer as a detector, and (4) evaluate                   
              manifold background levels by adding zero air directly to the                  
              manifold.
