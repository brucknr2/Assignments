Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation                
              to study the properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, and                   
              sea-ice on a transect between Murmansk, USSR and Nome, Alaska.                 
              There are few published measurements of biomass or production                  
              from most shelf and basin regions of the Arctic Ocean.  This                   
              project is one of four that will evaluate biological processes in              
              the Arctic Ocean during the cruise.  This research will measure                
              the distribution, abundance and rates of carbon incorporation by               
              phytoplankton in geographically diverse regions of the Arctic                  
              Ocean.  It will examine the factors regulating rates of                        
              production and the partitioning between exportable and total                   
              production large spatial scales.
