Abstract    :
              This project will continue and elaborate an extensive electron                 
              spin resonance (ESR) dating program directed toward age                        
              determination of significant sites in Europe, western Asia and                 
              southern Africa which yield important hominid skeletal remains                 
              and/or occupation occurrences reflecting varied adaptations and                
              behaviors of Pleistocene (or still older) hominid populations.                 
              This ESR dating program at McMaster University (Hamilton,                      
              Ontario) is the only such operation of its kind in North America.              
              Age determination of Pleistocene hominid skeletal samples and of               
              residues of occupation sites is critical to diverse on-going                   
              investigations directed at the elucidation of aspects of hominid               
              evolutionary biology and phylogenesis, past cultural adaptations,              
              inter-site correlations and the evolution of past environmental                
              circumstances in temporally-delineated frameworks.                             
                                                                                             
              Due to the abundance of bone/dental material in archaeological                 
              and paleontological sites the ESR method is particularly                       
              applicable to many important Pleistocene occurrences, and for                  
              ages up to several million years ago.  The precision of the                    
              method is approximately %3 - %5.  The method has been                          
              increasingly successfully applied by this laboratory at a                      
              diversity of Middle and Upper Pleistocene situations in Europe                 
              and western Asia and, preliminarily, in southern Africa, and                   
              provides an important resource for US archaeologists.
