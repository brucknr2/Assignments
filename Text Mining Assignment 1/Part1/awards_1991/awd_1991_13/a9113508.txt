Abstract    :
                       The history of atmospheric circulation is an important                
              element of paleoclimatology and the best reconstructions of                    
              atmospheric circulation come from analyzing the aeolian sediments              
              found in deep sea cores. This proposal requests support to use a               
              series of new piston cores to reconstruct the history of oceanic               
              and atmospheric circulation in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.  The              
              scientific goals of this study are to: 1) reconstruct the history              
              of northern hemisphere trade winds for the Pleistocene; 2)                     
              determine the relationship between climate change and                          
              productivity in the equatorial Pacific; and 3) determine the                   
              nature of orbital forcing and climatic-oceanic response in this                
              region.  This research is important because it will provide                    
              documentation of the response of the atmosphere to changes in                  
              climatic forcing, documentation of the response of the oceans to               
              changes in atmospheric circulation, and important data bases to                
              test the sensitivity of atmospheric General Circulation Models.
