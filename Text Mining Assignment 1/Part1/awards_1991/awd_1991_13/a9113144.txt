Abstract    :
                   This grant to the University of Texas at Austin provides                  
              for start-up equipment and expenses for an experiment designed                 
              to measure the mass of neutrinos from the beta decay of                        
              tritium.  The experiment will be carried out using an electron                 
              lens spectrometer of unique design.  The upper limit on the                    
              mass of tritium beta decay neutrinos to be attained in this                    
              experiment is expected to be below 5 eV.
