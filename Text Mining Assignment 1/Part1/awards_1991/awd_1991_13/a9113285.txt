Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports Dr. Donald Winget and others (including                    
              graduate students) of the University of Texas at Austin to                     
              collaborate in astrophysics research with Dr. Michel Breger and his            
              group at the Institute of Astronomy, University of Vienna.  The                
              two research groups have been operating two independent                        
              international telescope networks for measuring features of stars of            
              very different ages:  the Delta Scuti Network (Austria) and the                
              Whole Earth Telescope Network (Texas).  The networks are                       
              similar in their goal of completely resolving the brightness                   
              variations of complex pulsating stars into their component                     
              frequencies for seismological study of stellar interiors.  However             
              the networks are currently completely different and complementary              
              in the frequency domains that they cover.  The goal of the                     
              collaboration proposed for support here is to integrate the two                
              networks and software, personnel, and analytical methods.  The                 
              participants will then be able to measure simultaneously several               
              selected stars in extreme states of stellar evolution.                         
                                                                                             
              The work that provides the basis for this proposal has broken new              
              ground in the field of stellar physics through studies of the Sun.             
              The techniques and approach being employed have opened a whole                 
              new level of study of stellar dynamics and evolution, by probing               
              the internal structure of stars using networks of observations and             
              applying seismological theory.  The expanded collaboration offers a            
              unique opportunity to advance this research.
