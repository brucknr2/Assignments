Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year award supports collaborative research between                    
              Louise E. Anderson, University of Illinois at Chicago, and Gote                
              Johansson from the University of Lund in Sweden.  The objectives               
              of this study are to explore the interactions between plant enzymes            
              in chloroplasts using phase partitioning and to examine the effects            
              of modulators on enzyme partitioning.                                          
                                                                                             
              These experiments will contribute to our understanding of carbon               
              dioxide fixation during photosynthesis and of enzyme-enzyme                    
              interactions.  Disruption of these enzyme-enzyme interactions could            
              be important in analyzing the stressful effects of salt, drought,              
              flooding, and pollutants on plant photosynthesis.  Dr. Anderson and            
              Dr. Johansson will jointly conduct experiments and analyze the                 
              data.  This project will benefit from their complementary strengths,           
              specifically, Dr. Anderson's extensive background on enzyme-                   
              enzyme interactions and metabolism, and Dr. Johansson's expertise              
              in phase partitioning.
