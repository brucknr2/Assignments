Abstract    :
              The inherently parallel nature and high speed of optics, combined              
              with the recent technological advancements in optical logic,                   
              storage and interconnect devices are raising hopes for practical               
              realization of highly parallel optical computing systems.  This                
              research explores the application of optics to symbolic computing              
              using the Content-addressable Memory (CAM) model.  It covers                   
              algorithm development, architectural design and experimental                   
              demonstration.  The approach consists of examining the                         
              computational requirement of symbolic computing tasks, and                     
              implementing them as directly as possible, thereby as efficiently              
              as possible, using the parallelism and high speed of optical                   
              systems.
