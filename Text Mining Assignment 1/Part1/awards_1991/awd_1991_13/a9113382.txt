Abstract    :
              It is proposed to develop computer simulations                                 
              of two optical systems based on solitons.  The                                 
              first is a long-distance communication system,                                 
              and the second is a node in an ultra-fast ring                                 
              network.  The system simulation codes will be                                  
              built in a modular way so that scientifically                                  
              interesting and technologically useful results can                             
              be extracted at every stage of their                                           
              development.  Development scenarios and the                                    
              scientific questions which will be addressed are                               
              described in the proposal.  The value of the                                   
              proposed work lies both in the codes developed                                 
              which will be made generally available to                                      
              members of the scientific community, and in the                                
              scientific issues which we intend to resolve.                                  
              Our work will be characterized by close                                        
              cooperation with appropriate experimentalists.
