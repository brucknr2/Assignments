Abstract    :
              This award provides funds that will aid in the acquisition of                  
              computer equipment and software by an outstanding group of                     
              biochemists and organic chemists at Brandeis University.  The                  
              instrumentation will be used to aid in the research training of                
              graduate students working in the emerging area of bioorganic                   
              chemistry.                                                                     
              Increasingly, organic chemists and biochemists have come to                    
              realize that their disciplines have much to learn from and offer               
              to each other.  At Brandeis, such cross fertilization occurs in                
              the context of research programs in areas as diverse as the study              
              of enzyme mechanisms, synthesis of natural products and                        
              pharmaceuticals, molecular recognition, and the role of solvent                
              molecules in chemical reactions.  Work in these areas depends                  
              heavily of the use of computers for analysis and interpretation                
              of experimental data, and, as well, the formulation of new lines               
              of inquiry.  The equipment acquired through this award will                    
              insure that the training of a new generation of investigators                  
              will proceed in an environment with adequate state of the art                  
              computational facilities.
