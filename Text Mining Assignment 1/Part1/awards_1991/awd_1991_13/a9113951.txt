Abstract    :
              This grant funds a workshop on artificial Intelligence (AI)                    
              Methodology, held at the University of Massachusetts on June 2                 
              through June 4, 1991.  The purpose of the workshop is to assess                
              the current stat of AI methodology and discuss specific                        
              methodological improvements.  Especial attention is given to the               
              relation of AI theory to empirical research, and the soundness of              
              the state of the art methods in generating hypotheses,                         
              predictions, experiments and in allowing replication of results.               
              Approximately 25 scholars in the field of AI are invited to                    
              participate in this workshop. The workshop output is a volume of               
              edited papers on a range of methodological issues that is                      
              published in the form of a book.
