Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of carbon-carbon                 
              bond making processes that use organophosphorus moieties to                    
              control stereochemistry. Design of the auxiliaries strives to                  
              maximize chirality transfer while allowing recycling of the                    
              chiral auxiliaries.  Activation of cyclic dioxaphosphoranes by                 
              site-selective complexation with silyl cations will afford                     
              substituted 1,2-diols with high regio- and stereospecificity.                  
              Control of acyclic stereochemistry using a phosphoryl group in                 
              concert with the Mukaiyama-Michael reaction is planned and the                 
              unique metallation/alkylation chemistry of spirooxyphosphoranes                
              will be probed for both theoretical as well as synthetic gain.

              With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Slayton A. Evans of the                         
              Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina,                   
              Chapel hill.  Professor Evans will focus his work on projects                  
              that center on the design of new and versatile stereoselective                 
              carbon-carbon bond making strategies all of which use                          
              organophosphorus moieties to control the stereochemical course                 
              of the reactions.
