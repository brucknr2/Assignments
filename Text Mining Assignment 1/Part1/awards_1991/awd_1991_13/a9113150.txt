Abstract    :
              One of the outstanding frontiers of contemporary stellar evolution             
              theory is that brief period of binary star evolution known as the              
              "common envelope phase."  Prior to this phase, orbiting stars are              
              attracted closer and closer to one another by the exchange of mass             
              between them as one of them, then a "red giant" expands until the              
              two stars coalesce, becoming a common "star" within which two                  
              nuclei orbit.   It is thought that the common envelope is                      
              eventually ejected, leaving behind two distinct stars once again.              
              The Principal Investigator (PI) intends to build on previous NSF-              
              supported work on the origins of common envelope systems and now               
              plans to study the mechanism(s) by which the envelope can be                   
              expelled.  His models will include effects of circulation and                  
              cooling (recombination of H, He atoms) of an envelope matter                   
              through extensive two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations.  This              
              project is expected to give additional understanding to the                    
              formation of low mass x-ray binaries and closely orbiting neutron              
              stars and pulsars, and is thus of interest to a potentially wide               
              segment of the astronomical community.
