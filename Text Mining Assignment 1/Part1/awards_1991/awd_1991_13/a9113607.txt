Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will establish a Research Training Group in Language                
              Acquisition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The                 
              faculty group includes 19 members of two departments: that of                  
              Linguistics and Philosophy, and that of Brain and Cognitive                    
              Science.  The RTG will establish a new, 5 year graduate program                
              with elements drawn from the curricula of both departments.  The               
              funds awarded will provide stipends for graduate students,                     
              equipment needed for the training program, and limited travel                  
              funds and specialized technical assistance for the trainees.                   
                                                                                             
              An central focus of research in both linguistics and in cognition              
              has been understanding how the ability to use language develops                
              in humans, both historically and individually.  Related questions              
              involve the representation of language in the brain, and the                   
              mechanism by which such representation is computed or manipulated              
              by the brain.  Separate progress in our understanding of the                   
              structure of languages, and of the structure and function of the               
              brain and of the other organs involved in speech has set the                   
              stage for significant multidisciplinary research that synthesizes              
              the experimental approaches and results of traditional                         
              linguistics, of psycholinguistics and of computational science.                
              The training provided by this program will provide students will               
              the varied backgrounds and skills needed to do this kind of                    
              research.
