Abstract    :
                   The design of forming processes, particularly those involving             
              aluminum alloys, is the focus of the research of this collaborative            
              project between the University and industry.  The work will attempt            
              to utilize the complementary aspects of backward-tracing algorithms            
              and the ideal forming theory based on the minimum plastic work path            
              concepts. The design sensitivity calculations will be used as the              
              vehicle for relating one to the other.  A unified manufacturing                
              design strategy that attempts to optimize simultaneously the                   
              geometric and material specifications for the preform, as well as              
              the temporal and spatial characteristics of the process parameters,            
              is the immediate goal of this research.                                        
                   The design strategy will be applied to the design of real-life            
              forming processes, and the  results will be experimentally                     
              verified.  The design strategy will eventually be extended to                  
              include issues of product design as well.  This will allow the                 
              realization of an long-term goal of concurrent, rather than                    
              sequential, design of formed products and forming processes.
