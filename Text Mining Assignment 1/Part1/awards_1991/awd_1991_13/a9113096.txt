Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Gauging the extent of human genetic diversity has long been one of             
              the goals of physical anthropology.  During the 1960s and 1970s                
              tens of thousands of blood (and other tissue) samples were gathered            
              by geneticists and physical anthropologists from a wide variety of             
              native peoples.  At the time, most research on genetic variability             
              centered on the red cell enzymes and to a lesser extent serum                  
              proteins.  The nucleated white cells were viewed as useless and                
              generally discarded.  With them however, information at the DNA                
              level was discarded, which could now be very useful given modern               
              molecular biological techniques.   Stoneking and Weiss propose to              
              develop techniques, largely relying on a new technique called PCR,             
              to generate data at the genetic level from the few remaining white             
              cells which each sample likely contains.  Given that there are                 
              still tens of thousands of red cell samples in freezer around the              
              world, large amounts of information on genetic variability may be              
              unlocked if they are successful.  This is an especially important              
              project as many of the human groups are rapidly disappearing as                
              genetic and cultural entities.
