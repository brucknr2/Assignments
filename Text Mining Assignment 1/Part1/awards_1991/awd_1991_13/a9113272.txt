Abstract    :
              The project will lead to an understanding of the mass spectral                 
              fragmentation patterns associated with metal ion binding to                    
              proteins.  The work will concentrate on gas-phase studies of                   
              cationic and anionic complexes between peptides and alkaline                   
              earth and transition metal (II) ions.   The mechanisms of the                  
              fragmentation reactions will be studied so that information                    
              about the location of the metal ion in the fragmenting complex                 
              can be obtained.  Fragmentations of complexes between the metal                
              ions and particular amino acid sequences that are known to be                  
              specific metal-ion binding sites will be investigated.  The                    
              fragmentation pattern of specially designed peptides will be                   
              probed with a view to forming specific intramolecular chelates                 
              with metal ions.  The work promises to increase our fundamental                
              understanding of the fragmentation of large biomolecular ions                  
              and metal-peptide complexes.

              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on the use of mass spectrometry to study the                
              gas-phase chemistry of ionic complexes between peptides and                    
              metal ions.  The project promises to increase our understanding                
              of how metal ions bind to peptides, which is key to the                        
              behavior of these important components of living systems.
