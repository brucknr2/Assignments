Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to carry out fundamental                 
              research to develop a sequential methodology for system design                 
              evaluation.  This research combines the robust design                          
              concepts of Taguchi's design dependent parameter models with a                 
              system  optimization process resulting in a novel and innovative               
              approach to system sensitivity analysis.  The expected product is              
              the development of an efficient methodology to  assist in the                  
              implementation of concurrent engineering during the early system               
              design stage.  Integration of the methodology with Computer Aided              
               Engineering/Computer Aided Design tools will also be explored.                
                                                                                             
                   This research is expected to impact the development and design            
              of complex systems, both commercial and public sector, while also              
              influencing some aspects of strategic planning.
