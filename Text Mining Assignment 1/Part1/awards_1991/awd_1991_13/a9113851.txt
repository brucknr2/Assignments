Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic                      
              environment and its role in global change promoted by NSF's                    
              Arctic System Science Program.  It is a three year project                     
              to investigate equilibrium arctic climates simulated by                        
              state-of-the-art computer models for the global atmosphere,                    
              the Arctic Ocean and arctic sea ice.  A sequence of                            
              simulations and analyses will be performed with uncoupled,                     
              partially coupled, and fully coupled model systems.  This                      
              research effort will use existing data sets to simulate the                    
              present-day arctic climate and the climate of an enhanced                      
              greenhouse scenario.  Processes and feedbacks intrinsic to                     
              the Arctic, and neglected or poorly resolved in previous                       
              studies, will be evaluated in detail.
