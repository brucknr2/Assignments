Abstract    :
                   The PI's prior work on an essential problem in geophysical                
              fluid dynamics showed that a randomly turbulent mean flow can self-            
              organize into slowly varying zonal jets with flanking patches of               
              high-frequency smaller scale eddies ("storm tracks") under certain             
              conditions. The principal requirement is that the fluid contain                
              vertical and horizontal shears of flow and temperature differences             
              that combine to provide a particular type of instability often                 
              found in real atmospheres and oceans. This realistic behaviour                 
              developed, and was maintained, in a model with a highly idealized              
              set of theoretical restrictions. His proposed strategy is to gene-             
              rate a small suite of less restricted, but still highly abstract,              
              models by judicious removal of carefully selected simplifications.             
              These would be chosen to illuminate the specific model properties              
              responsible for producing these realistic features as well as for              
              limiting their degree of verisimilitude when compared with                     
              planetary-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulations. Another                  
              stated purpose is to test the robustness of the verisimilitude                 
              already achieved, and to demonstrate that this degree of realism is            
              not an artifact of the mathematical simplifications imposed in                 
              earlier models. Such stepwise building of basic understanding will             
              contribute to future advances in extended-range forecasting and                
              climate modelling.
