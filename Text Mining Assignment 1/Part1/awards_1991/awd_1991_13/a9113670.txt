                   This award provides partial support for the third annual                  
              SUNYA Topology conference held over the Columbus Day weekend,                  
              1991.  The conference focusses on combinatorial group theory and               
              low dimensional topology.  The invited speakers are Steve                      
              Gersten, Elia Rips, Joan Birman, Thomas Farrell, Allen Hatcher                 
              and James McCool.
