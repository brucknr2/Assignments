Abstract    :
              The proposed research entails the development and evaluation of                
              techniques for analyzing time series generated by nonlinear                    
              systems.  The algorithms which result will be compared to existing             
              filtering techniques using test data generated by numerically                  
              integrating systems of well-characterized, chaotic, nonlinear,                 
              first order, ordinary differential equations.  Rissanen's                      
              information-theoretic technique will be used to compare models                 
              generated by a variety of techniques.  As new techniques are                   
              developed, they will be applied to real data derived from speech               
              recognition experiments, hydrodynamic experiments, and coherent                
              solid state laser arrays.
