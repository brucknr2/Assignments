Abstract    :
              The Math/Science Network is a non-profit membership organization               
              of educators, scientists, engineers, mathematicians, parents,                  
              community leaders, and government and corporate representatives                
              whose mission is to promote the continuing development in                      
              mathematics and science of all people, with particular emphasis on             
              the needs of women and girls.  The Network is holding a two-day                
              Workshop for Expanding Your Horizons (EYH), day long conferences               
              for girls, coordinators.  The objectives of the Workshop are:                  
              establish direct communication between coordinators throughout the             
              country;  to encourage each coordinator to act as mentor to a new              
              conference site; to teach coordinators how to develop broad-based              
              community support;  to identify the kinds of help EYH coordinators             
              need; and to strengthen EYH coordinators' planning skills.
