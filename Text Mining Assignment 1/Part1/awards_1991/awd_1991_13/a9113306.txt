Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports collaborative research between                  
              Rosemary F. G. Wyse, Johns Hopkins University, and Gerard                      
              Gilmore, the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge University in the               
              United Kingdom. The objectives are to help determine the                       
              characteristics, structure and chemical evolution of the Milky Way             
              Galaxy.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The study of galaxy formation is crucial to obtaining knowledge                
              about the physics of the origin of structure in the Universe and to            
              an understanding of our Milky Way Galaxy.  The Milky Way                       
              remains the ideal galaxy for this study because of its proximity and           
              the abundance of available, detailed data.  These data are essential           
              for the testing and development of theories on galaxy formation and            
              for an understanding of the origins and different structure of other           
              galaxies.  The project involves the acquisition and analysis of a              
              very large number of stellar spectra and the development of a                  
              theoretical model in collaboration with British astronomer Gerard              
              Gilmore.  It is a well-balanced collaboration enhanced by the                  
              complementary expertise of the investigators and their respective              
              backgrounds in theory and observational astronomy.
