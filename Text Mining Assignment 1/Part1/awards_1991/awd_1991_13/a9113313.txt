Abstract    :
                The aim of this research is to determine the three-dimensional               
              structure of the native intact eukaryotic flagellum and of the                 
              major components participating in its motion.  This will be done by            
              reconstruction from low dose electron micrographs of hydrated,                 
              unfixed, unstained, unshadowed, intact flagella, trapped in their              
              native state by ultra-rapid freezing in thin layers of amorphous               
              ice.                                                                           
                                                                                             
              Many of the movements and rearrangements that occur within cells               
              utlize microtubule-based motors.  Imprtant examples include the                
              movement of chromosomes during cell division, and the transport of             
              materials from the cell body of neurons to their distant termini.              
              Little is known of the mechanism of any microtubule-based motile               
              process, even in the case of its most highly organized                         
              manifestation, eukaryotic flagella.   At present, the structure of             
              these microtubule based motors is not known well enough to suport              
              hypotheses about possible mechanisms.  This research will greatly              
              extend our knowledge of ciliary and flagellar structure and provide            
              an insight into the mechanisms of their movement, as well as the               
              structural basis for other microtubule dependent movement such as              
              chromosome separation and vesicle transport in nerve.
