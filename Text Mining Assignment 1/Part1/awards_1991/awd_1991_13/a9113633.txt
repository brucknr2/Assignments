Abstract    :
              The inherent passivity property of mechanical systems has long                 
              been recognized and exploited for stabilization, and applications              
              of this property appear in several contexts including robot and                
              spacecraft stabilization.  The underlying assumption is that                   
              every degree of freedom for such systems is directly actuated.                 
              However, when this assumption is violated, the passivity property              
              is less useful.  Earlier work has demonstrated that under a mild               
              stabilizability and detectability condition, the inherent                      
              passivity in a class of under-actuated systems remains very                    
              useful in the stabilization of such systems.  This project's                   
              intent is to further develop this approach.  Particular attention              
              will be paid to specific applications to common classes of                     
              flexible structures, including flexibly jointed robots, flexible               
              links, serially connected flexible bodies, and rigid bodies with               
              flexible appendages.  The theoretical results will be validated                
              on an existing laboratory experimental facility.***   //
