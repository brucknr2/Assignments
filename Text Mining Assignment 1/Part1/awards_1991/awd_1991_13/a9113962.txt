Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to             
              study the properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice and              
              biology in the Northeast Water (NEW) Polynya, which occurs near                
              northeastern Greenland, in order to gain an integrated                         
              understanding of Arctic shelf-slope processes.  This element of                
              the NEW program will provide necessary physical observations for               
              description of the dynamical processes contributing to the creation            
              and maintenance of the polynya as well as its water-mass structure.            
              This element of the program will contribute to the                             
              biological/chemical, mooring, and modelling efforts within the                 
              program.
