Abstract    :
                Increasing the Minority Scientist Pool is a three-year                       
              project (1991-1994) which consists of an intensive academic                    
              support program coupled with an early  research experience.                    
              It is designed to involve 15 minority students each year in an                 
              undergraduate program that leads to a career in the laboratory                 
              sciences.  Eight project students will major in chemistry, six                 
              in biology, and one in physics.  While enrolled in a degree-                   
              seeking program, project students will be involved in an                       
              academic support system which includes counseling, tutoring,                   
              study groups, support classes and cultural enhancing                           
              activities.  All students will be assigned to mentors who will                 
              engage them in a summer research project at the end of the                     
              first academic year.  During the remainder of the project                      
              years, mentors will engage project students in research                        
              projects during the academic years and summers.  The progress                  
              of project students will be closely monitored throughout the                   
              project.
