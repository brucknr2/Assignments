Abstract    :
                   It is planned to develop coherent phase models of Langmuir                
              waves turbulence driven by field aligned electron beams in the                 
              moderately magnetized lower auroral region and compare the                     
              numerically determined time-dependent solutions of these                       
              equations in two and three spatial dimensions with current                     
              rockets and planned satellite high time resolution measurements                
              of Langmuir turbulence.  ***
