Abstract    :
              The University of Washington will provide and coordinate support for           
              scientific activities of the New North Pacific Marine Science                  
              Organization (PICES) and the Regional Sub-Commission for the Western           
              Pacific (WESTPAC) of Unesco's Intergovernmental Oceanographic                  
              Commission (IOC).  The foci of this effort will be, for PICES:                 
              planning and organization of a PICES scientific workshop tentatively           
              planned for late 1991 and funding for participation of U.S.                    
              scientists in this workshop; participation of U.S. scientists in               
              PICES Governing Council meetings and related activities; and                   
              communications, secretarial assistance, travel, and documentation              
              costs for the Chairman pro tem of PICES; and, for WESTPAC, planning            
              of the Second WESTPAC Symposium in December 1991 and funding of                
              participation of U.S. scientists in the Symposium; and participation           
              of U.S. scientists in WESTPAC working groups and task teams.
