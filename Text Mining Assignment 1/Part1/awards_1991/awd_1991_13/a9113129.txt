Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this global climate project by                        
              Dr. Stephen Cox, Colorado State University and Dr.                             
              George S. Golitsyn, Institute of Atmospheric Physics,                          
              Academy of Sciences, Moscow, is to develop a joint US-                         
              Russia cloud-radiation research study with a three-fold                        
              purpose:  1) to plan and accomplish phases of the FIRE                         
              experiment investigating cloud and radiation problems;                         
              2) to use observing systems/platforms to study cirrus                          
              cloud systems and marine stratocumulus systems; and 3)                         
              to follow up field research by working to improve                              
              boundary layer modeling expertise.  The Russian                                
              researchers propose to have several US scientists                              
              participate in the FIRE ASTEX (Atlantic Stratocumulus                          
              Experiment) via the research vessel Academician                                
              Kurchatov.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of                                 
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                             
              researchers in the U.S. and Russia to combine                                  
              complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of                             
              strong mutual interest and competence in the field of                          
              basic scientific research on the basis of equality,                            
              reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
