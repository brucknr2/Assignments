Abstract    :
              This proposal describes a research plan to develop a                           
              time-domain based theory for the characterization of                           
              minimax controllers for linear and nonlinear                                   
              finite-dimensional systems with norm-bounded and                               
              partially stochastic uncertainties, and for the analysis                       
              of their robustness with regard to modeling                                    
              inaccuracies and order reduction.  A further topic of                          
              study will be the characterization of robust controllers                       
              for a (parametrized) family of plants and under                                
              multiple criteria.  The general approach to be adopted                         
              in this study is that of dynamic or differential game                          
              theory, which provides the most natural setting for                            
              these worst-case design problems, in both discrete and                         
              continuous time, and under different types of                                  
              measurement schemes.  For each class of problems, a                            
              relationship will be established between the worst-case                        
              controller performance and the upper value of a                                
              particular zero-sum dynamic game, which will facilitate                        
              a further robustness analysis in terms of admissibility,                       
              and sensitivity to unmodeled fast plant dynamics and                           
              weak subsystem coupling.  The game-theoretic                                   
              approach will also allow for multiple performance                              
              criteria and partial stochastic modeling.  Research                            
              efforts along the lines described in the proposal should                       
              lead to major advances in the methodology and design                           
              of worst-case controllers for various types of systems, as                     
              well as to some new fundamental results in the theory                          
              of dynamic games.
