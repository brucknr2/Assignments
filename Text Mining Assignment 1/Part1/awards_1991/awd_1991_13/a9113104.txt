Abstract    :
              New expertise and capabilities in the area of magnetic measurements            
              will be developed to compliment the existing Mossbauer program in              
              amorphous rare earth alloys at Franklin and Marshall College.                  
              Magnetic measurements will be made in collaboration with scientists            
              in the Superconductor and Magnetic Measurements Group at the                   
              National Institute of Standards and Technology, Boulder, Colorado.             
              It is proposed to add other magnetic measurement capabilities to               
              the existing laboratory at Franklin and Marshall, which will                   
              enhance the PI's skill in the area of magnetism, introduce                     
              undergraduates to new experimental techniques, and aid in her                  
              career development.
