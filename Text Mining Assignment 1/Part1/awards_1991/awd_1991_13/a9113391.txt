Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Indianapolis requests support from NSF for                   
              connection of its campus network to NSFNET.  They will contract                
              with INet at Indiana University to provide a medium speed (56                  
              thousand bits per second) connection to the NSFNET, a high speed               
              (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network.                  
                                                                                             
              The University needs greater functionality and network speed to                
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.***//
