Abstract    :
                   Allegheny College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via              
              a 56,000 bits per second line through the PREPNET med-level                    
              network.  The connection enhances collaborations of campus                     
              scientists with colleagues at other institutions, and allows access            
              to libraries and other remote facilities throughout the internet.              
              This award funds part of the costs for two years.
