Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ohio State University requests support from NSF for connection of              
              Heidelberg University, Antioch University, and Ohio Wesleyan                   
              University to the Ohio Academic Resources Network (OARnet) which               
              is the NSF mid-level network that serves the State of Ohio.  A                 
              primary goal of OARnet is to facilitate collaborative projects                 
              and sharing of resources between instutuion, including those                   
              outside the state.                                                             
                                                                                             
              OARnet will provide operations management and information                      
              services and it will give the three universities a connection to               
              the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)                    
              National Backbone network.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The universities need greater functionality and network speed to               
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore                   
              annovative educational resources.***
