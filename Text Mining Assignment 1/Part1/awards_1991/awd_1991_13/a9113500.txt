Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project aims to identify the insulator surface properties, at             
              the microscopic level, that control the electron multiplication                
              process leading to surface breakdown under electric excitation.                
              The surface properties of single crystal (defect free) and                     
              polycrystalline alumina (99.9% Al2O3) will be systematically                   
              altered                                                                        
              by mechanical, thermal, and chemical treatments.  Different                    
              treatments are intended to modify, in a deliberate and controlled              
              manner, such surface physical and chemical properties as a                     
              microdamage, residual stress, surface dielectric constant,                     
              oxidation state, surface potential, and density of localized                   
              (defect) levels in the band gap.  Phase I consists of three                    
              subsections:  (a) Mechanical treatment, (b) Thermal treatment, and             
              (c) Surface annealing.  Phase II will consist of (d) Chemical                  
              treatment, and (e) Surface cleaning.

              This project is a comprehensive study of high voltage flashover                
              phenomena, which have high merits in scientific contents.  The                 
              planned materials variables are based on preliminary work, and can             
              be expected to yield significant results.  The results can be                  
              useful to the electrical equipment and electronic industries.  They            
              should extend the understanding of surface discharge processes, not            
              only for vacuum gaps but also for general gas insulation problems.
