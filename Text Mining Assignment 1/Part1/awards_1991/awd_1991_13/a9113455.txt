Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop a                                                
              neural network based algorithm for                                             
              controlling eye and limb movements.                                            
              The algorithm will assume that                                                 
              different actuators (such as the                                               
              limb and the eye), in spite of                                                 
              their differences, share some basic                                            
              biological strategies in generating                                            
              appropriate movements to motor                                                 
              commands.  The proposed strategies                                             
              will be based on currently emerging                                            
              knowledge in neurophysiology, a                                                
              novel approach to guide the design                                             
              of artificial control systems.  If                                             
              successful, the research will not                                              
              only provide improved understanding                                            
              of natural motor control, but it                                               
              may also provide anew methodology                                              
              for designing artificial control                                               
              systems.  Such methodology would be                                            
              of great potential utility in                                                  
              robotics and in the design of                                                  
              control systems to aid the                                                     
              physically disabled.
