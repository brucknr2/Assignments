Abstract    :
                   Little systems software for distributed memory multicomputers is          
              portable to other multicomputers; as a result, users must pay as much          
              attention to the attributes of the hardware they use as to their               
              research.  Also, researchers working on different multicomputer                
              hardware can rarely share applications software.  In this setting, NSF         
              can take an active role in catalyzing the evolution of multicomputer           
              systems software.                                                              
                  During a year starting September 1, 1991, the Ohio Supercomputer           
              Center will port a portable operating system foundation, named                 
              Trollius, to multicomputers based on fast, leading microprocessors,            
              such as the Intel i860 and Transputer.  Multicomputers made by several         
              vendors will thus run compatible systems software.  Trollius is a non-         
              proprietary, "open" operating system for distributed memory parallel           
              computers.                                                                     
                   Small groups conducting scientific research are frequently the            
              end users who will benefit from having Trollius on their computer              
              systems.  Research areas pursued at current Trollius sites include             
              computer algorithms development, parallel processing research, and             
              computational mechanics.  The project will increase the useful                 
              lifetime of software developed by research projects and will expand            
              the use and usability of multicomputers in the U.S.
