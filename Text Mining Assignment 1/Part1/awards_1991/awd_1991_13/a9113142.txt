Abstract    :
              Three projects are planned, combining the numerical solution of                
              partial differential equations with bifurcation-theoretic                      
              analysis.  First, a simplified model of the Belousov-Zhabotinski               
              reaction, designed for computational speed, is to be studied.                  
                                                                                             
              Second, a new numerical method has been developed for temporal                 
              integration of large stiff systems.  This method achieves                      
              stability without matrix inversion by instead exponentiating a                 
              small (Krylov) matrix.  The method will be modified to solve the               
              Navier-Stokes equations and its properties will be analyzed                    
              theoretically.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Third, an existing numerical code which solves the Boussinesq                  
              equations of Rayleigh-Benard convection in a cylindrical                       
              geometry, will be used to study the breaking of axisymmetry, the               
              effects of rapid rotation, and the validity of two-dimensional                 
              model equations for pattern formation.                                         
                                                                                             
              Numerical solutions of partial differential equations are                      
              important both in their own right and in applications to a wide                
              variety of physical science and engineering applications.
