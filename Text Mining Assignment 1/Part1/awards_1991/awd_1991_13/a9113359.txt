Abstract    :
                   Professor Baumgartner will work in combinatorial set theory,              
              on questions connected to the theory of forcing and generic sets.              
              Areas of research include problems in the partition calculus                   
              involving properties of omega-3 assuming CH, focusing on                       
              properties provable in ZFC+CH together with the necessarily                    
              attendant independence questions; related problems on partition                
              ordinals, polarized partition relations and partition relations                
              for sets; problems on the sizes of closed unbounded sets; and                  
              problems on "cardinal invariants" connected both with measure and              
              category theory and with the theory of quadratic spaces.                       
                   Set theory lies at the foundation of all mathematics.                     
              Important questions concern the axioms that underly all number                 
              systems, algebra, geometry and analysis,  Are certain axioms                   
              necessary?  Are they irrelevant in certain contexts?                           
              Particularly significant in this regard is the Continuum                       
              Hypothesis (CH).  Understanding its role in mathematics has                    
              inspired some of the most profound investigations of the 20th                  
              century.
