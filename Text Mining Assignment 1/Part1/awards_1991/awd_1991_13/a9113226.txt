Abstract    :
              Abstractions are the basis for most of the ways that programmers look          
              at their programs, data, and execution.  Most of these abstractions            
              have a visual component.  This work envisions a system that will allow         
              programmers to rapidly define abstractions and their accompanying              
              visualizations.  Such a system would have immediate applications to            
              programming environments, data bases, parallel programming, and                
              education.  This project will investigate what it means to design such         
              a system and to explore many of the underlying problems that must be           
              solved before such a system can become a reality.  In conjunction with         
              other research projects, it will lead to an abstraction-based                  
              visualization environment to experiment with various solutions to              
              these problems and to evaluate the underlying concepts.
