Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific                              
              investigation to study the properties of the Arctic ocean,                     
              atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast Water (NEW)                   
              Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order                    
              to gain an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope                      
              processes.  This element of the NEW program will study the                     
              physical oceanography and circulation of the NEW polynya                       
              using closely-spaced CTD stations, Acoustic Doppler Current                    
              Profiler and current meter moorings.  Current meter moorings                   
              will be used during the initial four week research program                     
              and then redeployed for year-long measurements.  The                           
              moorings will be recovered during the second field research                    
              period.  The data from these instruments will be used to                       
              determine whether Atlantic Intermediate Water arrives in the                   
              polynya via the polynya trough system to supply heat to melt                   
              ice and to assess the importance of the flow fields to                         
              biological productivity.
