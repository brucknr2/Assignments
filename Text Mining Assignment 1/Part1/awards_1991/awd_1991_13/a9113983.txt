Abstract    :
                   This award is in the joint engineering/computer information               
              science engineering ENG/CISE research thrust in Intelligent                    
              Material Handling Systems.  The objective is to develop an                     
              intelligent system for the dynamic control of automated guided                 
              vehicle systems.  The system examines events occurring on the shop             
              floor and reasons about those events using a selective attention               
              mechanism.  The system will be developed and tested with                       
              substantial industrial collaboration in the automotive sector.                 
                   One of the greatest hurdles to overcome in the pursuit of                 
              fully automated manufacturing is the lack of "understanding" of a              
              global view of the shop floor on the part of the computer.  This               
              research effort represents an attempt to break down this barrier.              
              The direct interface with a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility            
              enhances the technology transfer potential of the effort and its               
              applicability to other academic and industrial settings.
