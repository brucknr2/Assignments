Abstract    :
              In this program various devices based on the                                   
              AlGaSb material system for optical source and                                  
              detector applications will be studied.  Various                                
              (Al,Ga)Sb based on photodetectors structures                                   
              including MSM (metal-semiconductor-metal),                                     
              PIN, SAGM (Separate absorption graded and                                      
              multiplication), etc., will be fabricated and                                  
              characterized.  In this area preliminary results                               
              have been very encouraging.  Record breakdown                                  
              voltages (6V) for molecular beam epitaxial                                     
              (MBE) grown PIN diodes without surface                                         
              passivation have already been obtained, and it                                 
              is expected that significant progress will be                                  
              made by pursuing a more comprehensive                                          
              program.  In addition to detectors, GaSb/AlSb                                  
              quantum well optical modulators and quantum                                    
              well lasers will be studied along with the                                     
              integration of PIN and MSM detectors with the                                  
              n- and p-channel FETs based on                                                 
              AlSb/InAs/GaSb.                                                                
              The optimal MBE conditions for the material                                    
              growth will be established through reflection                                  
              high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and                                   
              Auger electron spectroscopy.  The structural                                   
              properties of the materials will be characterized                              
              by x-ray diffraction.  The electrical and optical                              
              properties will be characterized Hall                                          
              measurements and photoluminescence.  Finally,                                  
              GaSb MSM, PIN, avalanche and SAGM                                              
              photodetectors will be fabricated and                                          
              characterized.
