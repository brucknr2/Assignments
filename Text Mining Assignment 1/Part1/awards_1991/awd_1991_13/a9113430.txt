Abstract    :
                The proposed program is designed to strengthen the                           
              existing Masters Degree Program in Applied Mathematics at                      
              Hampton University, to increase the interaction of faculty                     
              members with undergraduate students, to support the                            
              research activities of junior level faculty, to provide a                      
              solid foundation of research activities within the                             
              department to help progress to the goal of instituting a                       
              strong Ph.D. program in Applied Mathematics, and to allow                      
              for increased access to professional activities for minority                   
              students and faculty members.
