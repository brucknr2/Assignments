Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Clark Chapman at the Planetary Science Institute will implement            
              an observing program to obtain spectrophotometric colors on a set              
              of approximately 100 main-belt asteroids in the 2-20 km diameter               
              size range.  These data will enable him to identify taxonomic types            
              of these asteroids and will thus provide a statistically                       
              significant sample of the distribution of types that exist among               
              small main-belt asteroids.  Dr. Chapman will compare the                       
              distribution of types for small asteroids with those of larger                 
              asteroids and will use the results to address several fundamental              
              science questions about asteroids.  Among these are: (i) Are there             
              parent bodies for the ordinary chondrite meteorites among the small            
              main-belt asteroids? (ii) are there significant numbers of small               
              olivine-rich asteroids? (iii) Does the size distribution of small              
              S-type asteroids flatten at sizes less than 20 km diameter?                    
                                                                                             
              Dr. Chapman will acquire Charge Coupled Device observations in                 
              eight filters in the wavelength range of 0.35 micron to 1.1 micron             
              using 1m and 2m telescopes.  An important part of this program is              
              to establish faint standard stars in the eight-color system located            
              at regular intervals along the ecliptic plane.  Dr. Chapman will               
              also obtain rotation periods and lightcurve amplitudes of a subset             
              of the asteroids observed.
