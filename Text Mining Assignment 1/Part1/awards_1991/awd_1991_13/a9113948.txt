Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Three one-month time series of detailed profiles of temperature,               
              salinity and currents will be collected in the upper 300 m of the              
              Western Pacific Warm Pool as part of the Intensive Observation                 
              Period (IOP) of the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean             
              Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) taking place in late               
              1992- early 1993. Supporting measurements of rainfall, solar                   
              radiation, surface wind, air temperature, as well as light                     
              attenuation and in-situ fluorescence will be conducted to estimate             
              the heat and momentum fluxes through the mixed layer in response to            
              westerly wind bursts and rain squalls.
