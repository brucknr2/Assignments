Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Institutes of Health, Agency for International                    
              Development and National Science Foundation will sponsor a                     
              workshop on "Drug Development, Biodiversity and Economic Growth."              
              The workshop will convene governmental leaders and scientists                  
              from developing countries, representatives from the                            
              pharmaceutical industry, and agency personnel to discuss the                   
              valuation and preservation of biological diversity.  One                       
              mechanism for assigning value to naturally occurring organisms                 
              is the screening of plants and animals for medically useful                    
              chemicals; the workshop attendees will evaluate current screening              
              activities, discuss the need to also gather information about the              
              traditional uses of plants and animals by indigenous peoples, and              
              recommend ways in which the three sponsoring agencies can work                 
              together to support the inventorying and preservation of                       
              biological diversity in developing countries.
