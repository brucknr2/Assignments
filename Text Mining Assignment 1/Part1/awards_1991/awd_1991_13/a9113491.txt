Abstract    :
              This award funds the first year of a three year continuing grant.              
              A number of basic scientific issues remain to be addressed in                  
              order to facililtate the wide use of neural networks in control                
              systems.  This research focuses on trainable state estimation for              
              neural networks in order to deal with effects of plant and sensor              
              noise and incomplete availability of state measurments.  It will               
              also explore neural network implementation of a self-tuning                    
              regulator for adapting a controller to track changes in a                      
              nonlinear plant; techniques for controller weight initialization               
              that can decrease network training time and also reduce the                    
              probability of convergence of the weights to undersirable local                
              minima; and adaptation of networks for navigational obstacle                   
              avoidance to robotic manipulator obstacles avoidance.
