Abstract    :
                   This project studies the climate effects of the conversion                
              of the Amazon forest to a grassland, using simulations with the                
              NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM) and simple analyses for the                 
              surface parametrizations.  Emphasis is on the hydrological cycle,              
              in particular precipitation and evapotranspiration and inferred                
              runoff.  Besides the full deforestation scenario, short numerical              
              simulations will be used to reveal the relative importance of                  
              changes in albedo, surface roughness, and surface longwave                     
              emission.  The problem studied is used as an example to yield a                
              better understanding of mechanisms operating in a climate model                
              coupled to a land process model.   This study is important                     
              because the increased understanding derived from it will be used               
              to determine  needs for further improvement in the land component              
              of climate models.                                                             
                   This research is funded under the Climate Modeling, Analysis              
              and Prediction (CMAP) initiative of the Global Change Research                 
              Program.
