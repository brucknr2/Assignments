Abstract    :
              Hybrid von Neumann-dataflow architectures are an attempt to combine            
              hardware support for synchronization and latency hiding with von               
              Neumann features such as register files, instruction and data                  
              caches, RISC style instruction pipelining and vector data                      
              structures.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The success of a hybrid architecture design lies in its ability to             
              provide a balance between the dataflow and von Neumann features                
              that will optimize its performance.  This research provides both               
              quantitative and qualitative analysis of these features to                     
              determine such a balance.  In the first step, a quantitative                   
              evaluation of the relative extent of the various forms of locality             
              is performed.  Secondly, the architectural features, pertaining to             
              processor design and storage model, that can exploit these forms               
              of locality are determined.  The impact of these features on                   
              performance, code generation strategies and instruction set design             
              is evaluated.  Based on a given processor and machine architecture,            
              code partitioning and structure allocation strategies are                      
              determined and evaluated.  The hybrid dataflow model is evaluated              
              using a parameterizable, discrete event driven, register transfer              
              level dataflow machine simulator.
