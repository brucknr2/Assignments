Abstract    :
              HOL is a general theorem proving system developed at the University of         
              Cambridge.  Developed as a mechanization of a higher-order logic, HOL          
              is now being used in a variety of applications ranging from hardware           
              design verification to reasoning about communication protocols.  The           
              purpose of this workshop is to bring together the HOL user community           
              to exchange ideas about the future directions for HOL.  The                    
              workshop topics include:  progress in integrating HOL into more                
              traditional design and development environments; scrutiny of HOL from          
              logicians expert in higher-order logics; application of HOL as a               
              formal methods tool in verification.
