Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a project to design, fabricate and test two new-concept                
              aerosol inlets for use on aircraft, as part of a state-of-the-art,             
              aircraft based aerosol sampling system.  The major difference                  
              between these new inlets and commonly-used conventional isokinetic             
              inlets is the development and use of active wall filtration.  The              
              "active" walls of the inlets are completely covered with a shaped              
              filter substrate, and particles which hit these covered walls                  
              should be easily and efficiently captured.  Turbulent deposition in            
              the nozzle resulting from non-laminar flow, high airstream                     
              velocities and misalignment with the flow streamlines is not                   
              considered a major problem with these inlets.  In fact, wall                   
              filtration may prove to be the preferred method of aerosol capture.            
              A series of wind tunnel and aircraft experiments are proposed to               
              answer this and other questions.  Thus, aerosol "wall losses" which            
              plagued earlier sampling efforts may become a thing of the past.               
                                                                                             
              These inlets are a major portion of a new aircraft sampling system             
              we are in the process of developing.  Funding is requested from NSF            
              only for the design, building and testing of the inlets; other                 
              funding has been sought and acquired for the development of the                
              remaining portions of the aircraft sampling system.
