Abstract    :
                   The funds from this award will be used to support the                     
              Eleventh Annual Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on                   
              Differential Equations to be held in October of 1991 at                        
              Mississippi State University.  The topics for discussion at the                
              conference cover a number of important areas of differential                   
              equations:  ordinary and partial differential equations, integral              
              and functional differential equations, and applications of these               
              classes of equations to problems in physics and biology.                       
                   The purpose of this conference is to promote research and                 
              education in the theory and application of differential                        
              equations.  The conference will provide a forum for researchers                
              in the southeast and atlantic regions to exchange ideas with each              
              other and with colleagues from around the country and the world.               
              In addition, the conference will give graduate students and                    
              recent Ph.D.'s the opportunity to present their work, meet other               
              researchers, and learn about the latest results in their field.
