Abstract    :
              Linear partial differential operators or linear delay                          
              time systems are effective models for many physical                            
              phenomena.  Perturbations of these systems can often                           
              be modelled by white noise.  Typically these models                            
              have unknown parameters and the systems must be                                
              controlled so there is the problem of stochastic                               
              adaptive control for linear, stochastic distributed                            
              parameter systems.  In many distributed systems                                
              there is boundary control.  In this proposal some                              
              problems of adaptive control for linear, stochastic                            
              distributed parameter systems with boundary control                            
              are described for investigation.  Apparently no results                        
              are available on this topic.  The problem of stochastic                        
              adaptive control for these systems include the                                 
              exhibition of a consistent family of estimates of the                          
              unknown parameters, the continuity of the solution of                          
              a Riccati equation with respect to parameters, a                               
              generalization of the Ito formula and the verification                         
              of the self-optimizing property of a family of adaptive                        
              controls.  Furthermore the initiation of an                                    
              investigation of adaptive control for stochastic                               
              semilinear parabolic equations is proposed.
