Abstract    :
                   The objective of this internship project is to develop an                 
              efficient Just-In-Time production system in collaboration with a               
              leading manufacturer of agricultural equipment.  Objectives of                 
              the project include the analysis and development of a hybrid                   
              push/pull system for parts usage and integration of material                   
              handling equipment.                                                            
                   The manufacturing facility under study employs extensive use              
              of materials handling equipment and state-of-the-art automation                
              and robotics.  The results of the study will shed considerable                 
              insight into the effectiveness of Just-In-Time approaches in                   
              environments of this nature.
