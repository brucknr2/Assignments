Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary purpose of this Dissertation Improvement Proposal is               
              to clarify some of the factors affecting the appearance of early               
              modern humans.  Currently this is a major point of contention in               
              anthropology for some feel that modern humans arose quite                      
              recently while others attribute much greater antiquity to our                  
              species.  The student proposes to gather measurements on crania                
              from the Middle Pleistocene, the early and middle Upper                        
              Pleistocene and the late Upper Pleistocene; the key time periods               
              involved in this debate.  The data will then be analyzed by a                  
              variety of algorithms in order to test the competing theories                  
              about modern human origins.
