Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides funds to establish a multi-institutional                   
              Research Training Group in Evolutionary Primatology.  The faculty              
              group includes 20 evolutionary and behavioral biologists at five               
              institutions in New York City: the American Museum of Natural                  
              History, City University of New York, Columbia University, New                 
              York University and The New York Zoological Society.  The funds                
              awarded will provide stipends for graduate students and                        
              postdoctoral trainees, and will defray part of the cost of the                 
              trainees' research.  In addition, funds will be used to purchase               
              specialized research equipment to be used by trainees and to                   
              bring investigators from other research and academic institutions              
              to give research seminars and in some cases, to participate in                 
              longer term training activities.                                               
                                                                                             
              Evolutionary primatology draws its theory, methods and empirical               
              data from many areas within the biological sciences,                           
              anthropology, and geology.  The research programs of the                       
              participating faculty focus on human and non-human primates from               
              the perspectives of morphology, paleontology, systematics,                     
              molecular and population genetics, behavior, ecology, and                      
              conservation biology.  Thus the training provided by this group                
              will equip students with the broad background necessary for                    
              integrative studies in this challenging and interesting area.
