Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific                              
              investigation to study the properties of the Arctic ocean,                     
              atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast Water (NEW)                   
              Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order                    
              to gain an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope                      
              processes.  This element of the NEW program will provide                       
              complimentary data to studies evaluating the magnitude and                     
              spacial-temporal variation of phytoplankton and zooplankton                    
              biomass and taxa, primary and new productivity and its                         
              environmental controls, as well as associated parameters                       
              related to the impact NEW on water masses and shelf                            
              processes.
