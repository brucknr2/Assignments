Abstract    :
                   The P.I. plans to conduct field studies focused on (a) the                
              biosphere-atmosphere exchange of carbonyl sulfide (COS) and                    
              carbon disulfide (CS2) over continental areas, and (b) the                     
              photochemical oxidation of dimethylsulfide (CH2SCH3, DMS) in the               
              marine troposphere.  Both processes are important components of                
              the biogeochemical sulfur cycle with potentially large                         
              implications for global climate regulation.  Exchange rates of                 
              COS, CS2, and carbon dioxide (CO2) between plants (and soils) and              
              the atmosphere will be measured on a diurnal and seasonal basis                
              in different natural environments including a loblolly pine                    
              forest, an oak-hickory forest, and different agricultural biomes               
              with various types of crops (wheat, corn, soybeans, sorghum).  A               
              combination of different methods will be used including the                    
              gradient flux technique and enclosure chambers (using ambient air              
              or sulfur-spiked zero air as sweep gas).  Studies of the chemical              
              transformation of DMS over coastal and open ocean waters will                  
              also be made on a diurnal and seasonal basis.  A major part of                 
              this program will consist of collaborative measurements involving              
              new, highly sensitive techniques for continuous real-time                      
              detection of DMS, major oxidants such as the hydroxy (OH) and                  
              hydroperoxy radicals (HO2), and the major DMS oxidation products               
              dimethysulfoxide (DMSO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and gas phase                   
              methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and sulfuric acid.  The goal is to                  
              enhance our understanding of the atmospheric cycles of COS, CS2,               
              and DMS, in response to biological and meteorological factors.
