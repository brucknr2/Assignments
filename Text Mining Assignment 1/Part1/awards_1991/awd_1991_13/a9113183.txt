Abstract    :
                 Professor William Klemperer is supported by a grant from the                
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for structural and                     
              dynamical characterization of molecular complexes, high                        
              temperature species, and molecules in highly excited                           
              vibrational states.  The goal of these studies is to explore                   
              the nature of the intermolecular potential surfaces and the                    
              dynamics on these surfaces.  The dynamics of dissociation of                   
              weakly bonded species excited far above their dissociation                     
              energy will be determined by overtone excitation, the                          
              dissociation products being characterized with respect to                      
              polarization, angular, and frequency distribution of                           
              fluorescence.  The geometric and electronic structure of                       
              molecules for which there appears to be a severe mixing of                     
              nuclear and electronic motion  will be studied by molecular                    
              beam methods.  Rotational spectra of high temperature species                  
              will be obtained using molecular beam electric resonance with                  
              seeded beam sources.

              The geometric structure, electronic structure, and dissociation                
              of molecules in the collisionless environment of a molecular                   
              beam will provide information on the nature of the interactions                
              between molecules.
