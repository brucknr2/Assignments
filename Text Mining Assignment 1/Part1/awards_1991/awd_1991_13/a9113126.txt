Abstract    :
                   South Carolina State College requests support from NSF for                
              connection of their campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the                 
              midlevel network located in the southeastern United States.  It                
              will provide operations management and information services and                
              it will give South Carolina State College a 56 thousand bits per               
              second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million                
              bits per second) National Backbone network.                                    
                   The University needs greater functionality and network speed              
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
