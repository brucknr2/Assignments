Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Willamette University is establishing a connection to NSFNET via               
              a 56,000 bits per second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level               
              network.  The connection enhances collaborations of campus                     
              scientists with colleagues at other institutions, and allows                   
              access to libraries and other remote facilities throughout the                 
              internet.  This award funds part of the costs for one year.***
