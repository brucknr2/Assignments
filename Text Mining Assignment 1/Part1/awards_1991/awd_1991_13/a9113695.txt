Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the dynamics of dense                           
              x-pinch and z-pinch plasmas produced by                                        
              submicrosecond pulsed power generators.  An x-                                 
              pinch consists of at least two fine wires stretched                            
              between output electrodes of a high power pulser                               
              such that they cross and touch in the form of an X.                            
              Powered by 400-500kA, 80ns current pulses, the                                 
              resulting plasma is a very intense, submillimeter                              
              source of soft x-rays (starting with metal wires) or                           
              neutrons (starting with deuterated polyethylene                                
              fibers).  The objective of this study is to understand                         
              the dynamics of x-pinch plasmas so that possible                               
              applications (e.g., to microlithography, imaging of                            
              living cells and determining the spatial resolution of                         
              a neutron detector) can be intelligently evaluated.  To                        
              accomplish this effectively, a pulser designed                                 
              specifically to power the x-pinch will be built, and                           
              dense x-pinch plasmas (as well as the simpler z-                               
              pinches for comparison) will be studied with 1ns time                          
              and 0.1mm space resolution using optical and x-ray                             
              diagnostic techniques.  Soft x-ray measurements will                           
              be used to probe the dense core plasma, and                                    
              interferometry and Faraday rotation measurements                               
              will probe the surrounding region.  The purpose of                             
              these measurements is to determine the mass density                            
              and current density distributions as a function f time.                        
              From these quantities, the various phenomena                                   
              observed in x-pinch (and z-pinch) implosions can be                            
              understood.
