Abstract    :
                   This project provides continuing support for a series of                  
              Interdisciplinary Conferences in Applied Mathematics conducted by              
              the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).  The                
              conferences are designed to bring together mathematical scientists,            
              engineers, and other scientists who are developing and applying new            
              mathematical concepts, methods, and algorithms.  The primary                   
              objective of the conferences is to encourage fruitful interaction              
              among the creators and users of the mathematical sciences and                  
              thereby contribute to understanding of the mathematical sciences               
              and their applications to the solution of significant problems in              
              industry and society.  A second objective is to encourage the                  
              participation of students, women, and minority groups in this                  
              interaction.  The conferences under the previous award were                    
              particularly successful in this respect - nearly 18% of the                    
              attendees were students and 10% of the attendees were women -                  
              although SIAM recognizes that much more can be done in these areas.            
              The award supports four conferences per year for three years.
