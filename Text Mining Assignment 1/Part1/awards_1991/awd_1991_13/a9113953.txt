Abstract    :
              There has been great progress recently in the                                  
              creation of artificial three-dimensional dielectric                            
              structures which are to photon waves as                                        
              semiconductor crystals are to electron waves.  That is,                        
              these photonic crystals have a photonic bandgap, a                             
              band of frequencies in which electromagnetic waves                             
              are forbidden, irrespective of propagation direction in                        
              space.  A face-centered-cubic photonic crystal has                             
              recently been introduced, fabricated, and studied                              
              experimentally and theoretically.  The experimental                            
              findings for the photonic band structure and for the                           
              attenuation length within the band gap are in                                  
              excellent agreement with our calculated results.                               
              Photonic bandgap materials inhibit the spontaneous                             
              absorption and emission of photons of the                                      
              frequencies concerned and have many potential                                  
              applications in device physics.  Examples are zero-                            
              threshold semiconductor lasers, highly efficient                               
              heterojunction bipolar transistors and highly reliable                         
              light-emitted-diodes.  Moreover, very compact high-                            
              Q resonators can be made with these materials for                              
              applications from millimeter to ultraviolet                                    
              wavelengths by introducing defects into the structure.                         
              We will continue to search for photonic band gap                               
              materials with specific photonic band gap structures                           
              tailored to particular applications.  We will also                             
              calculate the effects of these materials on a variety of                       
              optical, atomic and chemical processes.
