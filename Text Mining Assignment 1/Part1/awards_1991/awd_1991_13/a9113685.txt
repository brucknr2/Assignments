Abstract    :
              This project supports the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropologist from Southern Methodist University studying the                 
              use of pharmaceuticals in urban Pakistan.  The project will                    
              provide ethnographic information about people purchasing and                   
              using pharmaceuticals.  Using participant observation, and                     
              structured as well as unstructured interviews with consumers and               
              pharmacists the project will study the marketing, distributing,                
              interpretation and uses of biomedical pharmaceuticals.  The                    
              research will enhance our knowledge of the medical belief system               
              and the resultant treatment-seeking process which will help                    
              researchers, health care providers, and policy makers to better                
              understand the basis for health care decisions and the use, and                
              misuse, or pharmaceuticals.                                                    
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the "folk medicine" of                      
              pharmaceuticals is very little studied, at the same time that the              
              world's population is urbanizing at a fast pace, and                           
              multinational corporations are providing pharmaceuticals all over              
              the world in retail outlets with no prescription control.                      
              Understand one case study of urban pharmaceutical use will be                  
              valuable indicating areas of potential concern as well as                      
              benefit.
