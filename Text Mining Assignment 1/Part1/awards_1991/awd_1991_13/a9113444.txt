Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will establish a Research Training Group in                         
              Cytoskeleton Biology at the University of Minnesota.  The faculty              
              group includes members of the departments of Cell Biology and                  
              Neuroanatomy, Genetics and Cell Biology, Biochemistry, and Plant               
              Biology.  The funds awarded will provide stipends for graduate                 
              students and postdoctoral trainees, will support research                      
              participation by undergraduate students and high school students,              
              and will defray part of the cost of the trainees' research.  In                
              addition, funds will be used to purchase specialized research                  
              equipment to be used by trainees and to bring investigators from               
              other research and academic institutions to the campus for                     
              seminars and bi-annual symposia.  University resources will                    
              augment the funds provided by NSF in most of these categories.                 
                                                                                             
              The cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells contains a dynamic, fibrous              
              network of actin filaments, microtubules and intermediate                      
              filaments that participate in virtually every aspect of cellular               
              form and function.  Because of the cytoskeleton's ubiquity and                 
              its role in cellular processes as diverse as gene expression,                  
              cell replication and division, and cell movement, studies of the               
              cytoskeleton provide an excellent focus for multidisciplinary                  
              training in at the forefront of modern biology.
