Abstract    :
                   The project plans to carry out a joint project between                    
              the university and an industrial steel company.  It has been                   
              observed that the production of hot rolled shapes is presently                 
              limited to moderately difficult materials and to dimensions that               
              are limited to size complexity and desired tolerances.                         
                   The objective of this program is to develop an isothermal                 
              capability for the production of round bars and shapes with a view             
              to achieving reduced section thickness in shaped bars, to achieve              
              better detail definition, improve the metallurgical structure, and             
              increase the size, shape and range of alloys.  The process                     
              modelling part of the program will use the latest techniques in                
              both analytical and physical modeling.
