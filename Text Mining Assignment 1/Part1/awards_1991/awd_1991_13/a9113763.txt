Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project convenes an international                                         
              conference on computational stochastic                                         
              mechanics in the fall of 1991.  The goal of                                    
              the conference is to bring together the two                                    
              distinct fields of computational mechanics                                     
              and stochastic processes and to facilitate                                     
              their applications in areas where uncertainty                                  
              and system complexity prevail.  In earthquake                                  
              engineering many problems are dominated by                                     
              factors which are uncertain, functions which                                   
              are non deterministic, or materials systems                                    
              which are too complex to model by                                              
              conventional mathematical means.  Stochastic                                   
              processes theories when combined with                                          
              advanced computational methods offer an                                        
              effective approach to the solutions of such                                    
              problems.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The conference will provide a unique                                           
              opportunity for exchanging ideas on the                                        
              current status of computational methods as                                     
              applied to stochastic methods and for                                          
              identifying future research needs.
