Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The research explores the availability and usefulness of                       
              linguistic cues to verb meaning that might help the child learner              
              to choose among the multitude of hypotheses consistent with                    
              observation of world events.  This approach, known as syntactic                
              bootstrapping, involves the use of syntactic information about                 
              verbs to constrain inferences about their meaning.  One line of                
              research looks at the judgments of adult speakers of English to                
              ask what inferences from syntax to semantics are supported by the              
              language.  Subjects will make judgments of semantic similarity                 
              between verbs, building up a picture of semantic relatedness                   
              within a set of verbs.  Other subjects will judge sentences for                
              acceptability, providing information about the structural                      
              properties of the same verbs.  Statistical comparisons of these                
              two data sets will determine whether various syntactic                         
              distinctions among verbs match semantic differences.  A second                 
              line of research explores what children know about syntax/meaning              
              relations, and whether they will make form-to-meaning inferences               
              in interpreting novel verbs.  Preschoolers are shown video-taped               
              scenes, and asked to interpret a nonsense verb used to describe                
              them.  The question of interest here is whether their                          
              interpretations of the same scene change depending on the                      
              sentence structure in which the nonsense verb is presented.
