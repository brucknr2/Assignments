Abstract    :
              A three-day workshop on automated reasoning is proposed.  The workshop         
              will be held at Argonne National Laboratory on June 3-5, l991 and will         
              be coordinated by Argonne National Laboratory and by the Institute for         
              New Generation Computer Technology (ICOT) of Japan.  The objective is          
              to provide an open forum for discussion between American and Japanese          
              researchers on current achievements and recent advances in automated           
              reasoning.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The workshop will feature presentations on such topics as classical            
              automated theorem proving, rewriting systems, prolog technology,               
              special-purpose reasoning methods, and open problems.  Participants            
              will also be given ample time for informal and open discussions.               
              After the workshop is over, joint research projects will be                    
              undertaken.  Thus, the workshop will have a long-term benefit of               
              promoting scientific advances in a spirit of healthy cooperation.
