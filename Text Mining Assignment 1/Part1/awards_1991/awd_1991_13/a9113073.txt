Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal seeks funds to acquire a research                           
              microscipe,computer, and digitizer to continue research into                   
              siliceous microfossils. The equipment will be used initailly                   
              for a shore-based study associated with Ocean Drilling Program                 
              Leg 138 to the east Pacific to study silcoflagellates and minor                
              microorganism groups. Emphasis on the research project will be                 
              onchanges in silicoflagellate skeletal morphology during the                   
              Miocene and Plisocene, which will be compared to changes in the                
              surrounding environment. Research on other siliceous                           
              microfossil groups, such as sponge spicules, will be conducted                 
              by undergraduate students under the principle                                  
              investigator'ssupervision.
