Abstract    :
                   Persistent, stable and shallow domes of cold air dammed to the            
              west by the eastern slopes of the southern Appalachian mountains               
              are a common mesoscale feature in the late fall and winter. Because            
              of the neighboring, much warmer Atlantic waters to the east, this              
              cold air damming is a major factor in distinguishing forecasts of              
              rain from those of the more dangerous frozen precipitation forms               
              (snow, sleet, freezing drizzle and rain). When it is present and               
              persistent it also favors the rapid genesis and intensification of             
              coastal winter storms. Unfortunately, inadequate resolution of the             
              observational, analysis and forecast systems, as well as a lack of             
              theoretical understanding, have caused poor forecasts of these                 
              events. Similar phenomena also occur along Colorado's Front Range,             
              affecting the distribution of heavy snow in the Denver-Fort Collins            
              urban corridor, and have been documented on other mountain slopes              
              around the world. Xu's goal is to improve our understanding of cold            
              air damming and to develop quantitative criteria for the diagnosis             
              and short term forecasting of its consequences.  He is an                      
              outstanding younger investigator and is recognized as one of the               
              leading group of theoretical hydrodynamicists considering concrete             
              weather forecasting problems.
