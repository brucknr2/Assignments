Abstract    :
                   In 1975, the International Union of Pure and Applied                      
              Chemistry Began the planning for the first of a series of                      
              conferences dedicated to discussion and study of urgent problems               
              facing the world on which chemistry has a direct bearing.  The                 
              conferences have come to be known as the "CHEMRAWN" conferences,               
              the acronym for  CHEMical Research Applied to World Needs.  This               
              grant provides partial support of the seventh conference in the                
              series, titled "World Conference on the Chemistry of the                       
              Atmosphere: Its Impact on Global Change".  It is dedicated to                  
              examining global threats to the environment and discussing the                 
              role chemistry may play in alleviating or eradicating such                     
              threats.  The conference will be co-sponsored by the                           
              International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and the                      
              American Chemical Society.                                                     
                   CHEMRAWN VII will be held in Baltimore, Maryland in December              
              of 1991.
