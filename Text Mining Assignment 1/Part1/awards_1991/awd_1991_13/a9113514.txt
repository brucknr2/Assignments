Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal coordinated by James V. Beck, Michigan State                     
              University and Oleg M. Alifanov, Moscow Aviation Institute                     
              sponsors a workshop on inverse problems in heat transfer.                      
              Nine American researchers from diverse universities will                       
              join the Russian group in East Lansing, Michigan in June                       
              1992.  Some French researchers may join them under                             
              separate funding.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Inverse problems in heat transfer provide an essential                         
              link between advanced experiments and analysis (including                      
              finite difference/element methods).  Several joint                             
              projects might result that could be applied to the study                       
              of ablation, combustion of solids, cooking of meat and                         
              other foods, bioengineering heat transfer investigations,                      
              processing of thermoset composite materials, and                               
              manufacturing and machining processes, to name only a few.                     
              Most of the proposed workshop participants attended a                          
              conference September 1990 in the USSR and a joint paper is                     
              currently in progress.  The proposed workshop has the                          
              potential of multiplying the individual and national                           
              efforts in inverse problems in heat transfer, which are                        
              important links between experiments and analysis.                              
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the United States and Russia to combine complementary                          
              efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual                             
              interest and competence in the field of basic scientific                       
              research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and                            
              mutuality of benefit.
