Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to develop a computer-                   
              integrated statistical process control (SPC) system for an                     
              electronic circuit board production line that uses surface mount               
              technology.  The system will consist of a database connected to an             
              on-line bar-code data acquisition network, an SPC analysis package             
              and an expert system for identification and diagnosis of quality               
              problems.                                                                      
                   The project will explore technological advances related to                
              surface mount technology for industrial applications with the                  
              potential for enhancing collaborative efforts between the                      
              university and related industrial firms.
