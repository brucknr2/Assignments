Abstract    :
              Methods for the use of monocyclic arene radical anions, such as                
              those of benzene, toluene, and mesitylene, in organometallic                   
              synthesis will be developed.  These are extraordinarily potent                 
              reductants, which are capable of converting all known d- and                   
              f-block transition metal ions to zero or lower valent arene                    
              complexes.  The recent availability in this laboratory of a                    
              variety of zerovalent group 4 carbonyls provides an opportunity                
              to explore the chemistry of these elements in previously                       
              unknown oxidation states.  The objectives will be to explore                   
              the chemical, electrochemical, and structural properties of                    
              these compounds as well as analogous group 5 carbonyls and to                  
              determine whether these new materials will be useful reagents                  
              in inorganic, organometallic, or organic synthesis.  Possible                  
              extension of this research to the group 3 elements Sc, Y, and                  
              Lu, for which no carbonyls are presently known, will be an                     
              important component of the research.

              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                    
              metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. John E. Ellis                  
              of the University of Minnesota will continue to develop methods                
              for the preparation of early transition metals in highly                       
              reduced oxidation states.  The chemical, electrochemical, and                  
              structural properties of these compounds will be explored.                     
              These highly reduced metal ions may prove to be useful reagents                
              in inorganic, organometallic, and organic synthesis.
