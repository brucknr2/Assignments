Abstract    :
              This award is in the joint ENG/CISE research thrust in                         
              Intelligent Material Handling Systems.  This research effort                   
              studies mobile manipulation for material handling, in the form of              
              integrated control of a mobile platform and robotic arm.  Such an              
              integrated system can offer major advances in material handling,               
              providing a wide range of new capabilities for such systems.                   
              This includes the ability to function in a partially modelled                  
              environment, the ability to carry out a diverse set of                         
              operational tasks relevant to material handling, and the ability               
              to carry out those tasks in real time.  The highly                             
              interdisciplinary research team brings together a wide-ranging                 
              collection of enabling technologies including system                           
              architecture, robotic modeling, sensing, navigational planning,                
              reactive control, micromanipulation, and others.  The involvement              
              of Georgia Tech's existing Materials Handling Research Center                  
              will provide an appropriate venue for both testing of ideas and                
              facilitation of technology transfer to interested industrial                   
              partners.
