Abstract    :
              Tajima proposes to continue the research on the solar-terrestrial              
              plasma processes on the following topics.  They are: transport                 
              coefficients in the geomagnetic tail plasma due to stochastic                  
              collisionless orbits and its relation to the substorm mechanism                
              and energetics of the magnetosphere - solar wind; (ii) the                     
              mechanism of the flare triggering via emergent magnetic flux                   
              tubes due to magnetic buoyancy from the photosphere into the                   
              coronal network fields; and (iii) the energetics, morphology, and              
              underlying dynamics of flux tubes in the solar atmosphere and the              
              convective zone, absorption of p-waves by the flux tubes of                    
              sunspots.                                                                      
              Sophisticated computer simulation will give insight into these                 
              problems and resolutions will be brought to some of the observed               
              phenomena of the substorm trigger and particle energization,                   
              flare triggerings, emerging flux region (EFR) phenomena, and                   
              sunspot absorption of sound waves.
