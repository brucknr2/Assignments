Abstract    :
              This proposal requests continuing support for a broad spectrum of              
              modeling activities concentrating on the high speed transport of               
              polar into the magnetosphere and on ionosphere-plasmasphere                    
              coupling.  Specifically, support is requested for the following                
              major research areas:                                                          
              1.  The use our hydrodynamic three ion species (H+,He+,O+) polar               
              wind model to reproduce observations of the classical polar wind               
              under changing geophysical conditions with special attention to                
              modeling the He+ dominated transient outflows.  Individual polar               
              wind and upwelling ions events will be also modeled and compared               
              the observations.  These comparisons will be done in cooperation               
              with Drs. M. Blanc, M.O. Chandler, J.M. Grebowsky, and T.E. Moore.             
              2.  Further studies of the ionosphere-plasmasphere system with our             
              ionosphere to conjugate ionosphere model.  Specific studies include            
              the investigation of solar cycle and seasonal variations in                    
              plasmaspheric parameters, the effects of variations in atmospheric             
              neutral hydrogen on plasmaspheric densities and modeling the                   
              effects of substorms on the coupled ionosphere-plasmasphere system.            
              3.  A multispecies model will be developed based on a gyrotropic               
              twenty moment approximation.  The coupled time-dependent 20 moment             
              transport equations will be solved with a second order accurate                
              (both space and time) Godunov-type upwind differencing technique               
              with dimensional splitting.  The numerical scheme itself is being              
              developed with the support of the NASA Space Physics Theory                    
              Program; however, its application to polar wind and plasmaspheric              
              flows is to be carried out in the framework of this proposal.
