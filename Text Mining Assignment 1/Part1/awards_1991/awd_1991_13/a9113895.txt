Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Spectral methods have been widely applied for transient and                    
              turbulent flows.  However their scope of application has been                  
              seriously limited by their inability to treat discontinuous                    
              problems and problems on nonsmooth domains.  This project                      
              intends to reduce these two restrictions of spectral methods.                  
              Oscillation-free uniform high order spectral methods to simulate               
              chemically reacting flows, especially the detonation waves and                 
              the transition from deflagration to detonation (DDT) will be                   
              designed.  To ease the domain restrictions, spectral methods and               
              the p- and the h-p version of the finite element methods will be               
              combined.  Then the combined method will be applied to general                 
              elliptic equations on nonsmooth domains and the results will be                
              used to simulate flows in irregular channels.  These methods will              
              be implemented on high performance computers.
