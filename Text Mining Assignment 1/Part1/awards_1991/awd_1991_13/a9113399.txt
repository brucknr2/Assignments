Abstract    :
                   This project initiates the first year of a five-year                      
              continuing award to the University of Cincinnati to join with the              
              University of Arkansas and Florida Atlantic University in merging              
              with the Georgia Institute of Technology's Industry/University                 
              Cooperative Research Center for Material Handling.                             
                   The university has developed the company support to be added              
              to the Center's industry base.  The research projects approved by              
              the new consolidated Industry Advisory Board for the University of             
              Cincinnati are "Decision Support System for the Design Packing and             
              Palletizing", "Simulation Generator for Material Handling Systems"             
              and "Evaluation and Enhancement of Fresh Fruit Material Handling,              
              Transport, and Storage."                                                       
                   A minority woman undergraduate is augmenting the Center's                 
              research program by studying "Palletizing Simulation."                         
                   The researchers are recognized experts in their fields and                
              have the capability and facilities to participate in the new merged            
              Center.                                                                        
                   The Program Manager recommends the University of Cincinnati               
              be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing                
              grant.  An Additional $3998 is recommended from the Women,                     
              Minorities, and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program.              
                   Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                  
              and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review            
              the progress of the Center on a number of criteria, including the              
              following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                    
              interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to                 
              which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                 
              robust research program is developing.  If the review is                       
              satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend support of the               
              next period of this continuing grant.
