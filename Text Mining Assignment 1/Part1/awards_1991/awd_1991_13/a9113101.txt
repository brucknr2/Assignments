Abstract    :
                   ACCESS will bring together, in scientific discussion and                  
              interaction, atmospheric chemistry doctoral candidates soon to                 
              receive their degrees, recent Ph.D.s, and funding agency                       
              representatives.  The colloquium will provide the opportunity to               
              forge future professional relationships, and the entire                        
              atmospheric science community will benefit by becoming more aware              
              of innovations in atmospheric chemistry through these                          
              researchers' efforts.  The colloquium will be held at MIT in                   
              Cambridge, Massachusetts, 13-15 June 1991 in conjunction with the              
              1991 Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry to be                 
              held in New Hampton, New Hampshire, 17-21 June 1991.
