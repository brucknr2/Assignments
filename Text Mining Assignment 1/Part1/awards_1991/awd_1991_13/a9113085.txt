Abstract    :
                   Dr. Nancy Marcus is Director of the Florida State University              
              Marine Laboratory on the Gulf of Mexico.  Dr. Marcus plans to                  
              improve the general research capabilities of the Lab by                        
              installing a small generator for emergency back-up electrical                  
              power, renovation and expansion of the seawater system that                    
              supplies the Lab, and replacement of the back-up generator aboard              
              the Research Vessel Nectes.                                                    
                  The proposed improvements to the seawater system will expand               
              the Lab's research capacity by adding facilities for rearing and               
              maintaining specimens, and for conducting controlled-environment               
              experiments.  The ship-board generator is an essential safety                  
              feature, providing back-up power for lights and instrumentation.               
              The back-up generator at the Lab will protect investigators from               
              power failures that can ruin experiments in controlled                         
              environment chambers and destroy living organisms that require                 
              circulating water.
