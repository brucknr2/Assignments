Abstract    :
                   This grant addresses the very serious, national problem                   
              of mentoring for women and minorities in the computer                          
              sciences.  Although it is recognized that different problems                   
              are faced by women and minorities, the PI has deliberately                     
              designed a project which attacks the shared issues.  The PI                    
              is chair of the committee on the Status of Women and                           
              Minorities (CSWM) of the ACM and she will direct a project                     
              team in the design of guidelines and training materials for                    
              the mentoring of junior professionals by senior professionals                  
              in the computer sciences.  In addition to developing specific                  
              mentoring materials the PI will conduct a mentoring workshop,                  
              initiate pilot projects, perform follow-up analysis, and                       
              disseminate results.
