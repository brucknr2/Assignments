Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The development of the expression of definite versus indefinite                
              reference in Finnish, a language which lacks articles, will be                 
              studied by examining narrative data collected from 3-, 4-, 5-,                 
              7-, and 10-year-old native Finnish-speaking children and adults.               
              This data will be compared to similar data from speakers of                    
              article-bearing languages (English, German, and Spanish), as well              
              as one non-ariticle-bearing language (Turkish), to determine how               
              and the degree to which Finnish, a Language which expresses                    
              definiteness in a variety of ways, influences the child's                      
              acquisition and use of this semantic/pragmatic category.  In                   
              comparing the acquisition of article-bearing and non-article-                  
              bearing languages, this research will also provide further                     
              insight into the basic Operating Principles that children bring                
              to the acquisition task.  This research also begins to fill the                
              gap of discourse-oriented studies on the acquisition of Finnish,               
              focussing on a much larger age range than previously dealt with                
              as well.
