Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Brookings Panel on Economic Activity aims to focus                         
              macroeconomic research on problems confronting the U.S. economy.               
              The Panel strives to fulfill this purpose by generating,                       
              discussing, and publishing high quality, relevant and timely                   
              research of macroeconomic significance.  Its first commitment is               
              to produce quality research, and the Panel's method of operation               
              is designed with that goal foremost in mind.  Its published                    
              research undergoes a much more intensive process of review,                    
              criticism, discussion and editing than conventional journals can               
              provide.  In this process and in the section of topics and authors,            
              the directors of the Panel are aided by the Panel Advisers, a group            
              of experts spanning a broad range of philosophical views and                   
              methodological preferences.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The Panel does not pursue highly abstract and purely theoretical               
              modeling of economic relationships which cannot be treated against             
              data and actual experience.  But subject to that constraint, its               
              notion of relevance is broad.  It includes research to explore                 
              fundamental characteristics of the economy and how it responds to              
              policy, as well as more applied research aimed at clarifying and               
              quantifying economic relationships.  It is concerned with issues               
              affecting economic performance broadly, including areas such as                
              long-run growth, global interdependence, and energy policy, as well            
              as the range of issues associated with business cycles and economic            
              stabilization.
