Abstract    :
                   Professor Saulson will initiate a program of research in                  
              experimental gravitational physics concerning mechanical                       
              thermal noise.  This effort is quite timely, since the                         
              spectrum of thermal noise of the test mass pendulums will                      
              likely be the limit of sensitivity of interferometric                          
              gravitational wave detectors, such as the proposed LIGO.                       
                   Saulson's research program will have three main areas of                  
              emphasis.  One will be a direct measurement of the thermal                     
              noise power spectrum in a test system that is damped by                        
              internal losses.  A second area will be a set of tests of                      
              possible pendulum flexure materials.  Finally, he will check                   
              proposed suspension designs for LIGO to verify that they show                  
              the expected low levels of losses.  Applications to other                      
              gravitational experiments will also be explored.
