Abstract    :
                   The overall objective of the proposed California Minority                 
              Graduate Forum is to increase the number of minority students                  
              from Southern California who eventually enroll in graduate                     
              school.  The Forum is being held for approximately 500 juniors,                
              seniors and master's minority students throughout Southern                     
              California who have indicated an interest in attending graduate                
              schools.  We have a commitment and from the participating                      
              colleges and universities that half of these students will be                  
              from disciplines which the National Science Foundation                         
              traditionally supports.  Students interested in going to                       
              professional school such as law or medicine will not be allowed                
              to participate. Representatives from 100 graduate schools                      
              throughout the United States will participate and the students                 
              will be able to discuss opportunities for graduate study with                  
              these individuals.  Several workshops will be given on topics                  
              ranging from financial aid to taking the GRE examination.                      
              Details on how to prepare for the exam as well as specific                     
              test-taking strategies will be discussed in the workshops.                     
              There will also be some motivational speeches by minority                      
              faculty role models and minority students who are currently in                 
              doctoral programs.  Representatives from NSF will also be                      
              invited to speak or participate in the forum panels and                        
              workshop.
