Abstract    :
              This project continues a study of type systems for the  -calculus and          
              functional programming languages.  The emphasis is on type-                    
              reconstruction problems.  Algebraic characterizations of type-                 
              reconstruction problems give rise to new and more general forms of             
              unification, often with applications in other areas of computer                
              science.  Together with type-reconstruction problems, the expressive           
              powers of the formalisms considered are to be compared and calibrated.         
              Principal topics include:  generalized type structures (especially             
              polymorphism, coercions, existential types), decision procedures for           
              unification problems and their complexity, programming features                
              characterized by complexity classes.
