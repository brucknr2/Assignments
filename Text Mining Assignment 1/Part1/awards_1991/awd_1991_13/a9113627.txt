Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is to support the activities of the Technical                      
              Committee on Centrifuge Testing of the International                           
              Society for Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering                          
              (ISSMFE).  Geotechnical centrifuges are used for                               
              experiments on earth structures.                                               
                                                                                             
              This international committee was formed in 1981, its                           
              purpose being: 1) to promote cooperation and the exchange                      
              of information on centrifuge testing and instrumentation; 2)                   
              to encourage the exploration of the potential of centrifuge                    
              testing in disaster reduction studies, in particular as a                      
              contribution to the International Decade of Natural Disaster                   
              Reduction (IDNDR); and 3) to organize an international                         
              conference approximately every 5 years.  The next                              
              conference is being held at the University of Colorado in                      
              Boulder, June 13-14, 1991.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This action is to provide partial support for the                              
              "International Conference: Centrifuge 1991" in Boulder,                        
              Colorado, June 13-14, 1991; as well as the activities of the                   
              committee in organizing this conference, and in planning the                   
              next series of regional and international conferences on                       
              centrifuge modeling.
