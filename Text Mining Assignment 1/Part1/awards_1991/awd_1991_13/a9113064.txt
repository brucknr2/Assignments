Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with two interdependent problems in                  
              discourse processing.  The first is to develop an explicit                     
              dclarative representation of referring relations to be used in the             
              generation and understanding of discourse anaphors. The goal is to             
              account for the mutually constraining effects of linguistic form               
              and the dynamically updated discourse mode. The second is to                   
              determine how to identify the distinct discourseactions that                   
              comprise a discourse, and how to relate these actions in a                     
              dynamically constructed hierarchical model of intentional                      
              structure.
