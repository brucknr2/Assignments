Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Sensory transduction is the initial step of stimulus                           
              reception in sensory systems, in which the capture of energy of a              
              stimulus (such as a light, sound, touch, or chemical) is                       
              converted into a neural signal to be sent to the brain.  This                  
              symposium will focus on the molecular mechanisms of sensory                    
              transduction, on the initial events in the receptor cells.  The                
              issues of stimulus sensitivity, discrimination, amplification,                 
              and adaptation will be covered for a several different sensory                 
              systems, by a multidisciplinary group of speakers and                          
              participants.  This conference and the publication of the                      
              symposium volume will have an important impact across this                     
              currently very active field of sensory research in neuroscience.
