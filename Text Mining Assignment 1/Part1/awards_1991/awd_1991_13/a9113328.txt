Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                  
              Training Group in Positive Political Economy.  The faculty group               
              is composed of 12 distinguished Political Scientists and                       
              Economists from the Government and Economics Departments and the               
              Kennedy School at Harvard University and from the Political                    
              Science and Economics Departments of the Massachusetts Institute               
              of Technology.  The funds will provide stipends for graduate                   
              students and postdoctoral trainees, purchase computers needed for              
              trainee research, aid with costs of trainee recruitment and                    
              provide part-time secretarial assistance.  Institutional                       
              commitments will aid in purchase of equipment and in other                     
              aspects of the group's                                                         
              efforts.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Addressing issues and problems at the interface of political                   
              science and of economics, research in positive political                       
              economics shows, in general, how observed differences among                    
              institutions affect political and economic outcomes in various                 
              social, economic, and political systems, and how the institutions              
              themselves change and develop in response to individual and                    
              collective beliefs.  More rigorous than traditional political                  
              science and more concerned with nonmarket institutions than                    
              traditional economics, positive political economics focuses on                 
              how political and economic institutions constrain, direct and                  
              reflect individual behavior in attempting to explain social                    
              outcomes such as production, resource allocation and public                    
              policy.
