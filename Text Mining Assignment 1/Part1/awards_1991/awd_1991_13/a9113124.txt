Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on processes and                          
              systems that produce multivariate data and are subject to                      
              changes in performance, some of which are upsetting and                        
              that may be avoided or better dealt with if they could be                      
              anticipated.  The statistical method for classifying upset                     
              conditions termed "discriminate upset prediction" involves                     
              use of current measurements as predictors of future                            
              conditions rather than using them only to characterizing                       
              the current state.  The discriminate upset prediction                          
              process involves finding the parameter or parameters that                      
              best characterize a future upset condition and which may                       
              therefore serve to activate responsive measures to avoid                       
              the upset.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Preliminary feasibility studies involving a suspended                          
              growth biological wastewater treatment process and the                         
              operation of a waste disposal facility have been                               
              conducted.  The possibility of being able to predict a                         
              future upset in a process operating normally by examining                      
              current operating records would be of great value in                           
              assuring consistent and reliable operation of facilities                       
              that affect environmental quality.  Results from this                          
              research may be applied in engineering design relating to                      
              the operation of treatment processes for water and                             
              wastewater treatment, other environmental engineering                          
              applications and manufacturing, in general.
