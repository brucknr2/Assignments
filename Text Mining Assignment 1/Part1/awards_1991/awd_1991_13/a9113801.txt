Abstract    :
                   This project is in the area of manufacturing processes to                 
              develop a long-term research collaboration between the University              
              and a leading United States printer and manufacturer of printing               
              equipment.  The training part of the project is aimed at                       
              acquiring an in-dept knowledge of heat-set web offset lithography              
              and the scientific and engineering issues involved in the design               
              and manufacture of printing equipment, in particular ovens and                 
              chill roll stands.  In the second phase of the project                         
              preliminary research will be initiated with the goal                           
              characterizing the process parameters.  This work will attempt to              
              understand the complex heating and cooling processes in the web                
              as well as the stability of web motion as it moves through the                 
              press.                                                                         
                   The ultimate goal is to identify the key scientific problems              
              that need to be solved in order to alleviate the condensate                    
              streaking problem that currently limits high quality high speed                
              printing.  On site experiments will be explored under realistic                
              press operating conditions to acquire a basic understanding of                 
              the dynamic flow of heat, moisture and solvent in the web as well              
              as to verify preliminary modelling efforts.
