Abstract    :
                   The investigator studies two models for the cardiac                       
              conduction system.  In connection with these models he                         
              investigates the existence of travelling wave solutions and                    
              studies the stability and bifurcations of the waves.  He seeks a               
              simplified version of the Beeler-Reuter model for mammalian                    
              ventricular fibers that retains qualitative significance while                 
              provoking analytical insight, and plans comparisons between the                
              full and the simplified model.  Both analytical and computational              
              tools will be employed in the project.                                         
                   Mathematical models such as these have been useful in                     
              studying the behavior of the heart.  The research of this project              
              may contribute to better understanding of heart electrodynamics                
              and heartbeat abnormalities.
