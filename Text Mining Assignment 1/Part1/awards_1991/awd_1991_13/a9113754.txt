Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific                              
              investigation to study the properties of the Arctic ocean,                     
              atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast Water (NEW)                   
              Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order                    
              to gain an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope                      
              processes.  This element of the NEW program will evaluate                      
              the magnitude and spacial-temporal variation of                                
              phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and taxa, primary and                    
              new productivity and its environmental controls, as well as                    
              associated parameters related to the impact NEW on water                       
              masses and shelf processes.
