Abstract    :
                   Kalamzoo College requests support from NSF for connection of              
              its campus network to NSFNET.  MERIT is the midlevel network                   
              located in the state of Michigan that will provide operations and              
              network information services.  It will give Kalamazoo College a                
              56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high                   
              speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone                     
              network.                                                                       
                   The College needs greater functionality and network speed to              
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
