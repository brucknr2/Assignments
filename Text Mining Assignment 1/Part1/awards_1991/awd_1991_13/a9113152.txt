Abstract    :
              This project deals with fundamental, microscopic aspects of the                
              wetting and spreading of fluids on solid surfaces.  Understanding              
              and controlling these phenomena pose both scientific questions and             
              technological problems.  Static and dynamic phenomena will be                  
              probed on both the macroscopic and microscopic scales using                    
              optical, x-ray and neutron techniques.  One goal is to understand              
              the behavior of macroscopic contact angles and their dependence on             
              properties of the materials involved.  A further goal is to                    
              understand the origins of the macroscopic behavior with the                    
              microscopic structures and dynamics of fluids confined by the                  
              interfaces at and near the contact line, the point where the fluid             
              body ends at the solid surface.  Results of the proposed research              
              will improve the understanding of fundamental wetting phenomena and            
              will add to the needed scientific basis needed for engineering                 
              advanced materials and technological processes dominated by wetting            
              and spreading.
