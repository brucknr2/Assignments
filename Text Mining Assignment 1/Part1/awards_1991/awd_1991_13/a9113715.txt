Abstract    :
              This project will explore methods for developing efficient parallel            
              multiplatform array algorithms and implementations.  The research              
              will mainly focus on decomposition in preparation for the solution of          
              a number of important problems in computational linear algebra.  The           
              decomposition will be implemented on a variety of SIMD and MIMD                
              machines, both with and without shared memory, under various                   
              interconnection schemes.  Formal methods based on a functional                 
              language with arrays for deriving/developing array algorithms.
