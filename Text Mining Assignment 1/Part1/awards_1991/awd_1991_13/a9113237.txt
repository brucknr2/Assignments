Abstract    :
                   The K-alpha spectra of nickel, copper and zinc will be                    
              studied using state-of-the-art resolution available from a                     
              monolithic double crystal spectrometer.  The objective is to                   
              measure the K x-ray lines with enough resolution to characterize               
              the effects of multiplet splitting which are believed to result                
              from perturbations by outer shell vacancies.  The resulting data               
              will make possible improved atomic structure calculations, and                 
              provide improved understanding of inter-electron dynamics.
