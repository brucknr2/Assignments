Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is intended to measure the segment adsorption profile            
              for a polymer physadsorbed to an interface from dilute solution.               
              It will concentrate on the most simple case, that of a neutral                 
              homopolymer adsorbed to a neutral, smooth surface.  This is                    
              idealized in the laboratory by the study of polymer adsorption from            
              a dilute solution to the solution/air interface.  The methods to be            
              employed for the study are:  X-ray Evanescent Wave Induced                     
              Fluorescence (XEWIF) and surface tensiometry on polymer solutions;             
              These techniques measure the profile at the level of the segment               
              size and the macroscopic (thermodynamic) scale.  The studies will              
              use fractionated poly(dimethylsiloxane) and measure its adsorption             
              from solutions in toluene (good solvent).  These experiments are               
              intended to test the limits of mean-field theories and demonstrate             
              the relative importance of fluctuations on the final density                   
              profile.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This research initiation grant will test experimentally various                
              theories of polymer adsorption, which are important in adhesion,               
              coatings, and other applications.
