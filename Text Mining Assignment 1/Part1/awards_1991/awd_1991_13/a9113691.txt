Abstract    :
              We are requesting for a differential scanning calorimeter (                    
              DSC) equipped with extended temperature range (220C), an                       
              external cooling unit, data collection and analysis system                     
              and software and reusable cells.   This is the only DSC with                   
              the requisite sensitivity and temperature range offered.                       
                                                                                             
              The acquisition of this instrument will permit the P.I.'s to                   
              analyze the thermal denaturation characteristics of enzymes                    
              from thermophilic and superthermophillic organisms, to study                   
              the molecular mechanism of thermal denaturation of small                       
              proteins of know structure, to analyze thermodynamic basis                     
              of action of a protease inhibitor of physiological                             
              significance and to explore the significance of subunit and                    
              domain interactions in producing activity in an enzyme.                        
              These studies will extend our knowledge of the structural                      
              basis of thermal stability in proteins and activity in                         
              enzymes.
