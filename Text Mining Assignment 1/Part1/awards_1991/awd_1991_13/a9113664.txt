Abstract    :
                   This ongoing research program is concerned with some of the               
              physical processes and structures that occur in thin electrical                
              current sheets and plasma boundary layers in the Earth's                       
              magnetosphere, with special emphasis on the magnetopause.  This                
              current sheet forms the outer boundary of the magnetosphere and                
              separates it from the rapidly streaming solar wind.  The proposed              
              research is centered in three areas.  The first of these is                    
              concerned with the development and testing of data-analysis                    
              methods for single-spacecraft data that can be used to examine                 
              the two-dimensional or three-dimensional structure of the                      
              magnetopause itself as well as the geometry of bulges, or                      
              deformations of the magnetopause, caused by magnetic flux                      
              connection across the current layer (so-called FTEs) or by                     
              dynamic-pressure pulses in the solar wind.  The data to be used                
              in this part of the study were obtained by the AMPTE/IRM                       
              spacecraft.  The second area concerns the development of analytic              
              and numerical models of one-dimensional current sheets                         
              representing so-called intermediate shocks which are dissipative               
              and rotational discontinuities, which are nondissipative.  Both                
              of these types of magnetic and plasma structures have been                     
              proposed to represent the magnetopause during periods of magnetic              
              field reconnection.  The third area of study is the reconnection               
              process itself and the manner in which it may be initiated and                 
              grow in the region near the subsolar magnetopause.  Analytical                 
              theory, as well as numerical simulation methods will be employed.
