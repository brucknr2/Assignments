Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a Phase II proposal.  In Phase I, PI established the              
              feasibility of, and wrote programs for data retrieval.  The                    
              programs make public health data, including teenage pregnancy                  
              data, collected by the State of California accessible to resear-               
              chers using standard SPSS and SAS analytic packages.  Phase II                 
              proposal is to continue developing the retrieval and archiving                 
              packages, to make them operate more efficiently, to develop                    
              search and retrieval software, and to create documentation and                 
              user manuals.  They document a variety of follow-on funding,                   
              contracts, and agreements.
