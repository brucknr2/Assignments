Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research proposed here is aimed at enhancing significantly                 
              the range of chemical systems that can be studied by bringing                  
              together - in a single research team - the most advanced quantum               
              theoretical and computational scattering methods with the most                 
              advanced numerical algorithms for solving the kinds of                         
              mathematical problems that are at the core of these scattering                 
              methods.  The goal is to establish a working interface between                 
              recent advances in numerical algorithms and corresponding                      
              breakthroughs in high-performance computing whereby newly                      
              developed and efficient numerical methods are integrated with                  
              existing scattering codes with the resulting programs tailored to              
              be executed with maximum efficiency on distributed memory MIMD-                
              type supercomputers, such as a Hypercube.  The plan is to develop              
              sufficiently powerful approaches that we will be able to carry                 
              out benchmark studies on the role of long-lived complexes (i.e.,               
              quantum resonances) in chemical reactions involving a high                     
              density of state.
