Abstract    :
              This project concerns the application of two theoretical                       
              tools-successive linear combination algorithms and blossoming-                 
              to a variety of curve and surface schemes in CAGD (computer                    
              aided geometric design).  A successive linear combination                      
              algorithm is any algorithm that proceeds by taking successive                  
              linear combinations of (usually) pairs of points or vectors.                   
              Examples include the de Boor algorithm and Boehm's knot                        
              insertion algorithm.  Blossoming is the technique of                           
              associating with a polynomial curve or surface a multivariate                  
              multiaffine symmetric polynomial that contains information                     
              about the curve or surface.  The two tools are related, and                    
              have been applied previously to Bezier and B-spline curves and                 
              surfaces with great success.  Here these tools will be applied                 
              to many of the other curve and surface types-such as rational                  
              B-spline, Catmull-Rom, Chebyshev, and multivariate spline                      
              schemes-that are of interest to CAGD.  Successful application                  
              of these tools will result in derivation of new algorithms and                 
              new properties for these schemes, development of new surface                   
              schemes, simplification and unification of parts of the theory                 
              of CAGD, and ultimately in better practical tools for design                   
              and manufacture using freeform curves and surfaces.
