Abstract    :
              This project involves the formation of strained rings                          
              containing both alkoxy and arylphosphonium salt functional                     
              groups so that their utility in a tandem ring expansion-Wittig                 
              reaction can be assessed.  The alkoxycyclopropyl and cyclobutyl                
              phosphonium salts will be prepared from beta-oxophosphonium                    
              salt derivatives.  Formation of these substituted strained                     
              rings has not been reported, so an efficient method leading to                 
              their synthesis is of clear value.  In addition, their                         
              preparation will lend new insights into the reactivity and                     
              applications of the beta-oxophosphonium salts, which are                       
              themselves important Witting reaction precursors.  Finally, the                
              study of the ring cleavage of these strained rings followed by                 
              a subsequent Witting reaction will determine whether this                      
              method will be suitable for development in more complex systems.

              reactions leading to medium-sized rings which are common in a                  
              large number of natural products.
