Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Southeastern Louisiana University is establishing a connection to              
              NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line through the SURANET                   
              mid-level network.  The connection enhances collaborations of                  
              campus scientists with colleagues at other institutions, and                   
              allows access to libraries and other remote facilities throughout              
              the internet.  This award funds part of the costs for two                      
              years.***//
