Abstract    :
                   FUSE (Fordham University Science                                          
              Experience) ia a program aimed at increasing                                   
              access to and retention of underrepresented                                    
              minority students in science.  In its first                                    
              year the program will recruit 12 promising                                     
              students:  six entering freshmen, four                                         
              entering sophomores, two entering juniors and                                  
              zero entering seniors.  The key elements of                                    
              the program include the following:  early                                      
              socialization of students in a mentored                                        
              research experience with teacher-scholars who                                  
              are experienced in mentoring undergraduate,                                    
              especially minority, students in research;                                     
              networking and academic enrichment experiences                                 
              including informal discussions with minority                                   
              scientists; academic support services                                          
              including advising.  Each aspect of the                                        
              program will emphasize the importance of                                       
              networking, but the core of the proposed                                       
              program is early intervention with a focus on                                  
              the research experience.  Each student will                                    
              have the opportunity to select a faculty                                       
              mentor from the areas of cell and molecular                                    
              biology, cell physiology, cellular                                             
              biochemistry or photochemistry.  FUSE students                                 
              will work closely with faculty mentors on                                      
              individual research projects and are                                           
              encouraged to prepare presentations of their                                   
              research at local and national scientific                                      
              meetings.
