Abstract    :
                   Computational group theory is an interdisciplinary field                  
              which involves the use of groups to solve problems in computer                 
              science and mathematics.  At least three communities have                      
              strongly influenced this field: (1) the theoretical computer                   
              science community through studies of the complexity of                         
              computation with groups and their connections with the complexity              
              of combinatorial isomorphism or search problems; (2) the symbolic              
              algebra/computer algebra communities, which have built large                   
              integrated software packages and have developed CPU efficient                  
              algorithms for group theoretic computations; and (3) the group                 
              theory community through continued progress on understanding the               
              structure of groups, most notably the classification of finite                 
              simple groups.                                                                 
                   This project will support the DIMACS (Center for Discrete                 
              Mathematics and Computer Science) Workshop on Groups and                       
              Computation to be held October 7-10, 1991 at Rutgers University.               
              Research on computational group theory currently appears in                    
              diverse forums in both mathematics and computer science.  This                 
              reflects the role of groups as fundamental mathematical objects                
              with a wide range of applicability.  This workshop will bring                  
              together researchers in theoretical computer science, computer                 
              algebra, and group theory to discuss group-theoretic algorithms                
              for both serial and parallel computer architectures.
