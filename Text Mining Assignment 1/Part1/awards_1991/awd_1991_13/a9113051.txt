Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                For most newborn mammals the most important sense is that of                
              smell, to guide critical behavior such as suckling.  This project              
              will use anatomical methods to determine at what age chemical                  
              stimuli in the nasal cavity become effective by reaching nasal                 
              nerve cells, and determine when those nerve cells establish                    
              appropriate connections with target cells in the brain.  These                 
              studies will be important for producing an atlas of the olfactory              
              part of the brain during olfactory development, for clarifying                 
              how changes in chemosensory surfaces may relate to functional                  
              changes in olfaction, and the RUI component involving                          
              undergraduates in research assures an impact on scientific                     
              education.
