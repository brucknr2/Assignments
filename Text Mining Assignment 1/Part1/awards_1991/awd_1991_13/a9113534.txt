Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his research in                  
              probability in infinite dimensional spaces, particularly on                    
              convergence of empirical processes indexed over general classes of             
              functions and their applications in statistics.  He will consider              
              uniform and universal classes of functions for different limit                 
              theorems, the parametric and the non-parametric bootstrap, U-                  
              processes and differentiable functionals with the general aim of               
              increasing the applicability of modern empirical process theory.               
              He will also continue to study the characterization and limit                  
              theory of max infinitely divisible and max stable processes, and               
              random sets.
