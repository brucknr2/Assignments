Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on the occurrence of                      
              chelating agents in surface waters and the role they play                      
              in determining the quality of natural surface waters.  The                     
              investigator plans to obtain direct experimental data on                       
              the role played by phytochelatins, newly discovered, water                     
              soluble, metal sequestering compounds, naturally occurring                     
              in phytoplankton that may provide the dominant source of                       
              strong chelating agents in natural waters that in turn                         
              influence water quality.  Following development and                            
              application of the analytical techniques, the project will                     
              involve field studies of sources and sinks of chelating                        
              agents, and systematic determination of their                                  
              thermodynamic and kinetic properties.                                          
                                                                                             
              Results of this project are expected to provide a basis                        
              for determining the role of natural chelating agents in                        
              affecting the fate and biological effects of trace metals                      
              such as copper, zinc and cadmium in natural waters.                            
              Knowledge of this may have a significant effect on                             
              engineering design and location of wastewater treatment                        
              facilities to minimize their undesirable impact on water                       
              quality such as initiation of algal blooms.
