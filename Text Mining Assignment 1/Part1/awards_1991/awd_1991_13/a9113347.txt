Abstract    :
              This three-year award supports cooperative research between Olli               
              Tuovinen, Ohio State University (OSU) and Borje Lindstrom from                 
              the University of Umea in Sweden.  The objective of the research               
              is to develop a genetic transfer vector system for Thiobacillus                
              ferroooxidans, an autotrophic bacterium which has been used in the             
              recovery of metals by leaching.  Their long-term goal is to develop            
              a genetically improved strain with greater leaching capacity and               
              resistance to toxic metals.  A new strain may also prove useful in             
              the desulfurization of coal.  The development of a gene transfer               
              system for T. ferrooxidans could facilitate these improvements.                
                                                                                             
              The OSU group has expertise in the biotechnology of T.                         
              ferrooxidans and organic sulfur degradation in coal.  The Umea lab             
              is concerned with bioleaching at levated temperatures.  The labs               
              will conduct parallel experiments with different test organisms.               
              The project will benefit from the availability of new test organisms           
              and joint efforts in characterization and analysis.
