Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this research is to assemble a physical map                
              of the Arabidopsis genome.  Mapping will be achieved by linking                
              the entire genome of Arabidopsis thaliana which will ultimately                
              consist of a fully overlapping collection of clones encompassing               
              the 5 linkage groups.  The genome linking using YAC (yeast                     
              artificial chromosome) clones to contig hybridization is listed                
              as the highest priority activity in the long-range plan for the                
              Multinational Coordinated Arabidopsis Genome Research Project.                 
              The physical map will provide easy access to any region of the                 
              genome thereby simplifying the cloning of important loci which                 
              have been identified by mutational analysis.  The probes used in               
              this study will be placed in the national Arabidopsis resource                 
              center and will be made available to the general research                      
              community.
