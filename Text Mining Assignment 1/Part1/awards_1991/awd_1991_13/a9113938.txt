Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic                      
              environment and its role in global change which is promoted                    
              by NSF's Arctic System Science Program.  It is a two year                      
              study to investigate the effect of heat input into the                         
              atmosphere produced from relatively warm water exposed by a                    
              break in polar ice.  The study will use a large-eddy                           
              atmospheric model.  This model explicitly simulates the                        
              convective turbulent eddies that such inhomogeneous heating                    
              creates and does not rely on assumptions of horizontal                         
              homogeneity.  This simulation seeks to bridge the gap                          
              between air-sea-ice coupled models and large-scale primitive                   
              equation models, neither of which can accurately model the                     
              turbulent transfer on such time and space scales.  The heat                    
              transferred upwards from the water will be analyzed to                         
              determine the amount which is recaptured by ice and the                        
              amount and location of that retained by the atmosphere.
