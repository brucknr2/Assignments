              This award provides partial support to the National                            
              Academy of Sciences (NAS) for the initial meeting of a                         
              joint committee of the NAS and the Academy of Sciences of                      
              the U.S.S.R. (ASUSSR) on Science and Technology Policy.                        
              The committee, co-chaired by NAS Vice President James D.                       
              Ebert and ASUSSR Vice President Yuriy A. Osipyan, will                         
              provide a nongovernmental, high-level forum for discussion                     
              of policy issues of mutual interest in the areas of                            
              research infrastructures (technical personnel, research-                       
              industry linkages, roles of states/republics, big/small                        
              science balance) and innovation in applied research and                        
              development (government role in creating incentives,                           
              internationalization of industrial technology, public                          
              financing of industrial research in the transition to                          
              market economy, military-civilian technology relationships).                   
              The results of the discussion will be summarized in                            
              published form.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              the understanding of science policy issues in the United                       
              States and the U.S.S.R. by enabling leading specialists to                     
              discuss issues of mutual interest on the basis of equality,                    
              reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
