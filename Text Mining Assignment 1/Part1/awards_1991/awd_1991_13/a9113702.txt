Abstract    :
              The objective of this Phase II proposal is to explore                          
              the development of a new, low-cost, high-reliability,                          
              high-definition prototype three-color projection                               
              display system.  The proposed Membrane Projection                              
              Display (MPD) system consists of three electron-                               
              beam-addressed Membrane Light Modulators (e-                                   
              MLMs) that are read out in reflection with the red,                            
              green, and blue components of a single high-                                   
              brightness lamp.  The e-MLM makes use of Optron's                              
              proprietary high-density, multi-conductor Charge                               
              Transfer Plate (CTP) which acts as a supporting                                
              substrate for the membrane.  The CTP, which                                    
              consists of a dense array of longitudinally-oriented                           
              conducting pins embedded in a wafer of insulating                              
              material, enables the electron-gun-deposited charge                            
              distribution to electrostatically deform the highly                            
              reflective metallized membrane which is stretched                              
              over wells etched into the CTP.  Schlieren filtering of                        
              the light reflected from the three e-MLMs yields an                            
              intense, high-contrast-ratio image that is projected                           
              with an achromatic imaging system onto a high-gain                             
              screen.  High brightness and multi-color image                                 
              registration are achieved by use of the zero-order                             
              readout beams.  The e-MLM offers flickerless                                   
              operation, is computer controlled, and offers the                              
              possibility of mixing different display formats (e.g.,                         
              graphics, text, standard video images) on the same                             
              screen simultaneously, and in real-time.  The MPD                              
              system to be developed in this program will have a                             
              75-mm diameter active area that will contain 1,000 x                           
              1,000 pixels, offer 60Hz framing rate, and projection                          
              into a 40o field of view with 2000 lumens at the                               
              screen.
