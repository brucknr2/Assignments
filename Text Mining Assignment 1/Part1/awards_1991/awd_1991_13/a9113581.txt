Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              and the Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program will                
              help the Department of Chemistry at the University of Kentucky                 
              acquire a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer console                
              and probes which will be used in research investigations in the                
              following areas of Chemistry.                                                  
                                                                                             
              1)  NMR Studies of Metallacumulenes and Carbide Complexes.                     
                                                                                             
              2)  NMR Studies of Water Transport Across Erythrocyte Membranes.               
                                                                                             
              3)  The Influence of Local Fields on Protein Reactivity.                       
                                                                                             
              4)  Studies on Boron-Nitrogen Compounds.                                       
                                                                                             
              5)  Photoaffinity Probes for Natural Products Binding Tubulin.                 
              % % %                                                                          
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
