Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The primary objective of this US-Hungary Project                               
              Development Visit by Dr. Susan Glenn of the University                         
              of Oklahoma is to support development of a proposal to                         
              study succession and restoration ecology.  The US                              
              researcher proposes to visit Hungary 1) to review and to                       
              identify study sites in Hungary; 2) to become more                             
              familiar with research being conducted by Hungarian                            
              scientists; 3) to collaborate in designing experiments;                        
              4) to better acquaint the Hungarian scientists with                            
              western-style proposals; and 5) to visit the Institute                         
              of Ecology and Botany.  The researchers will plan the                          
              investigation of the effects of small manipulations on                         
              successional pathways.  The researchers plan to set up a                       
              series of parallel experiments in restoration in                               
              Oklahoma, Kansas and Hungary and to analyze successional                       
              and non-successional community dynamics on Konza                               
              Prairie.  The results of such research may aid in                              
              devising methods to increase the rate of succession and                        
              to direct the successional pathway.                                            
                                                                                             
              This project in the field of ecology fulfills the                              
              program objective of facilitating scientific contact for                       
              the purpose of advancing scientific knowledge by                               
              enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern                      
              Europe to combine complementary talents in areas of                            
              strong mutual interest and competence.
