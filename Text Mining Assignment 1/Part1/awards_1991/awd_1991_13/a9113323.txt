Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Bordwell                   
              will develop new methods for estimating the magnitudes of bond                 
              dissociation energies (BDEs). These studies are expected to                    
              provide quantitative estimates of the relative magnitudes of                   
              BDEs and the corresponding radical stabilization energies                      
              (RSEs) for the species that are formed upon homolytic cleavage                 
              of bonds between hydrogen and other atoms. His work will                       
              provide the first quantitative estimates of the relative                       
              magnitudes of RSEs for a large number of radicals. At the same                 
              time, these measurements will serve to extend the                              
              dimethylsulfoxide-based acidity scale, which provides                          
              quantitative measures of anion basicities and, through the                     
              Bronsted equation, their reactivities toward electrophiles.

              Knowledge of the energies, called "bond dissociation energies",                
              that are required to cleave particular chemical bonds is                       
              important to physical-organic chemists who seek to develop                     
              fundamental structure-activity relationships that can be used                  
              to predict the reactivities of individual chemical bonds in a                  
              given molecule toward a particular reagent. This information,                  
              in turn, can be used by synthetic organic chemists in                          
              developing new synthetic strategies.
