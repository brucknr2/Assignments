Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator together with graduate students                
              will work on several statistical problems in genetics and                      
              molecular biology.  Many of the questions concern the different                
              kinds of maps of the human and other genomes.  A number of these               
              maps require statistical methods for their compilations; others                
              have errors and biases which are best quantified and dealt with                
              in statistical terms.  A further class of questions to be                      
              addressed concern the use of molecular data in systematics and in              
              evolutionary theory more generally.  Again statistical models and              
              methods play an important role, both in helping elucidate                      
              phylogenetic relationships, and in expressing the strength of                  
              support data lends to competing theories.  Many of the techniques              
              required for dealing with these questions have aspects which have              
              not featured prominently in Statistics hitherto.
