Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This State-of-the-Art survey award will send Dr. Rameshwar N.                  
              Bhargava, of Philips Laboratories of Briarcliff Manor, New York,               
              to Japan to do an in-depth critical survey of recent Japanese                  
              developments in optical properties of nanocrystals and nanocom-                
              posites of II-VI semiconductors.  Dr. Bhargava will attend the 5th             
              International Conference on II-VI Compounds and then spend three               
              weeks visiting related Japanese industrial and academic research               
              institutions working on the optical properties of nanoclusters                 
              and nanocomposites.
