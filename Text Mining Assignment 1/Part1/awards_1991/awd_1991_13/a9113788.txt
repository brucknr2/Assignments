Abstract    :
                   The general focus of this internship project is to carry out              
              research directed at automating the design and manufacture of                  
              dies.  In particular, a parametric design and manufacturing                    
              system will be developed that takes as an input the CAD model of               
              a stamped part (e.g., and automobile outer panel) and produces                 
              the design of die components required for its manufacture.                     
                   The design and manufacture of dies is a problem central to                
              reducing the concept to customer time for a variety of industrial              
              products.  The results of this research are expected to directly               
              impact the competitiveness of United States manufacturing                      
              industries.
