Abstract    :
                   This award will enable a faculty member to work in close                  
              cooperation with a local industry to develop a theoretical                     
              understanding of brushing, which is a secondary metal-cutting                  
              operation.  Studies of the process will be conducted to establish              
              relationships between process parameters and tool related                      
              parameters such as brush life, brush filament damage, etc.                     
              Optimum brush characteristics such as filament stiffness,                      
              geometry and fabrication technique will also be explored.                      
                   This will enable the introduction of a greater degree of                  
              automation in the brushing process and optimization in order to                
              reduce costs and increase the efficiency of secondary finishing                
              operations.  It will enable the United States manufacturing                    
              enterprise to be more competitive, since secondary finishing is                
              critical in many manufacturing operations.
