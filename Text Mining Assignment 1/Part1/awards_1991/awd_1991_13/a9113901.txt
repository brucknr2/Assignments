Abstract    :
                   The objective of this internship project is to develop a                  
              computer model that will analyze and test cell loading rules within            
              a chemical processing and manufacturing environment.  The                      
              methodology is driven by a schedule-based materials requirement                
              planning process (SB-MRP) to generate finite capacity schedules as             
              opposed to rough-cut capacity planning.                                        
                   The application environment is unique in that this effort will            
              be carried out subsequent to an in-house Just-In-Time effort that              
              focused on waste elimination.  The applicability of SB-MRP as an               
              integration tool should result in useful generalizations for                   
              similar environments.
