Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific                              
              investigation to study the properties of the Arctic ocean,                     
              atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast Water (NEW)                   
              Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order                    
              to gain an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope                      
              processes.  This element of the NEW program will measure                       
              nutrients and chemical tracers including dissolved oxygen,                     
              carbon dioxide, anthropogenic halocarbons (freons) and                         
              natural radionuclides.  These measurements will permit                         
              characterization of key aspects of the physical, biological                    
              and chemical oceanography of the polynya and serve as                          
              important collaborative input to the NEW Program.
