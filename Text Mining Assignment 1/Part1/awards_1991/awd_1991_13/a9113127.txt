Abstract    :
              Although concrete structures are subject to large numbers of load              
              applications during the design lives, often involving stress                   
              reversals, and concrete is known to deteriorate both in strength               
              and stiffness under such repeated load applications, relatively                
              little is known about its fatigue behavior, especially about the               
              damage accumulation in the low-cycle fatigue range.  It is proposed            
              to perform a comprehensive experimental test program to fill this              
              gap in knowledge, by measuring the energy dissipation capacity of              
              concrete with and without fibre reinforcement under uni-and biaxial            
              stress cycles.  The results of this experimental study will                    
              constitute a data base that will permit the development of damage              
              prediction tools and low-cycle fatigue analysis of concrete members            
              subjected to arbitrary load histories.  The proposed research                  
              contains also an analytical component with the objective of                    
              developing a theory to simulate damage accumulation in concrete and            
              to predict the fatigue life for variable-amplitude load histories.             
              As the Palmgren-Miner hypothesis of linear damage accumulation is              
              known to apply neither to metal structures nor to concrete, the                
              experimental data to be obtained shall serve as a basis to                     
              construct a more accurate damage prediction model with which the               
              remaining life of concrete material can be determined.
