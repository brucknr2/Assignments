Abstract    :
                   Careful design of an experiment may yield a more direct as                
              well as a more efficient and precise analysis at the experiment's              
              completion; this research gives mathematical constructions for                 
              optimal designs in several important experimental situations.                  
              Optimal repeated measurements designs can be used whenever                     
              sequences of observations are made on each experimental unit or                
              whenever a collective analysis of curves is planned.  For the                  
              many circumstances where the greatest source of uncertainty lies               
              in the initial choice of model, designs will be constructed which              
              are robust against deviations from a postulated model. For                     
              situations in which some highly desirable observations are                     
              impossible or excessively costly, criteria and algorithms will be              
              developed using combinatorial and optimization theories for                    
              choice among "near-optimal"  designs.
