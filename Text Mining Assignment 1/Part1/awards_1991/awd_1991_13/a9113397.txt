Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor DeLeon will develop a                        
              reaction rate theory for molecular isomerization, molecular                    
              dissociation and bimolecular reactions. The fundamental idea                   
              governing this unified reaction rate theory is the concept of                  
              cylindrical manifolds embedded in phase space.  Based on this                  
              concept, Professor DeLeon will develop a reaction rate theory                  
              with two principal features: (1) the theory accurately predicts                
              population decays and rate constants, (2) the theory yields                    
              physical insights and quantitative data on the dynamics of a                   
              chemical reaction. He will also implement the theory in a                      
              simple  manner and thus have a quantitative idea about the                     
              nature of any necessary approximations.

              The theories of nonlinear dynamics that Professor DeLeon will                  
              apply to the investigation of chemical reaction rates will help                
              the experimentalists to better understand the fundamental                      
              molecular processes underlying many important chemical                         
              reactions.
