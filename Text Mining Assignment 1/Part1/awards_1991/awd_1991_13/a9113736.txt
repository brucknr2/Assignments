Abstract    :
                This the the second year base and first year match funding of a              
              five year PYI continuing award                                                 
              complex queries in future database systems  is a major focus of                
              this work.  The applicability of randomized algorithms for query               
              optimization is investigated or several types of database                      
              systems, e.g., relational, object-oriented, and parallel systems.              
              Emphasis is placed on identifying the abstract characteristics of              
              cost functions and data models that determine the effectiveness                
              of such algorithms.  Of special concern is also the propagation                
              of errors in parameters that affect the query optimizer's                      
              decisions.  This research leads to developing techniques for                   
              query optimization in future systems where current technology                  
              is inadequate.  Another focus of this work is the study of                     
              specialized database systems for managing data from scientific                 
              experiments.  The emphasis is on graphical user interfaces and                 
              semantic heterogeneity. Collaborating scientists from many                     
              disciplines provide guidelines for the goals of this effort based              
              on the needs of their laboratories.  This research develops tools              
              that enables such scientists to use database technology                        
              effectively for their experiments.  Although this work is driven               
              by the specific needs of scientific databases, its results can be              
              applied to solve many similar problems faced by next generation                
              database systems in general.
