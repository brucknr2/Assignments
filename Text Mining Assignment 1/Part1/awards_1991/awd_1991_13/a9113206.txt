Abstract    :
              This Minority Research Planning Grant project is supported                     
              through  the Office of Special Projects and the Analytical and                 
              Surface Chemistry Program in Chemistry and involves the use of                 
              layered, sheet-like, clays as selective adsorbants for                         
              separations.  The adsorption process takes place in spaces                     
              between clay plates which act as molecular sieves.  Clays where                
              the aluminosilicate plates are negatively charged and counter                  
              cations of sodium are inserted between the clay layers will be                 
              studied.  The sodium ions can be exchanged by larger cations in                
              order to expand the spacing of the layered clays and create                    
              void volumes where permeation can occur.  Clays that are                       
              modified in this manner will be designed for use in size                       
              exclusion chromatography.

              Minority Research Planning Grants are intended to strengthen                   
              the proposal writing and planning capabilities of new                          
              investigators and to facilitate preliminary studies and other                  
              planning activities related to the research.  This project will                
              involve extensive interaction with senior researchers at                       
              Michigan State University during the formulation of research                   
              ideas and the preparation of the research proposal.
