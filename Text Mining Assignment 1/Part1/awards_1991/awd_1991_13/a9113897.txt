Abstract    :
              Professor Richard M. Noyes is supported by a grant from the                    
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his                
              studies of oscillations and dynamic instabilities in chemical                  
              systems.  In particular, Noyes proposes to perform studies in                  
              the following basic areas: 1) to further the mechanistic                       
              studies of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction; 2) to improve our                
              understanding of the oscillatory oxidation of benzaldehyde; 3)                 
              to study the nucleation of bubbles and transport of molecules                  
              between gas and liquid phases; 4) to extend the theories of                    
              behavior in complex systems; and 5) to study oscillations and                  
              instabilities in biological systems.

              Any chemical system isolated from further inputs of matter or                  
              energy will ultimately decay toward a nonreactive state called                 
              chemical equilibrium.  If light or heat or reactant chemicals                  
              of high energy are constantly added, the system may be kept far                
              from equilibrium and may exhibit exotic behaviors such as                      
              oscillations in composition or bursts of gas evolution.  Noyes'                
              research program is directed to discovering and elucidating                    
              these mechanisms and to learning the conditions responsible for                
              their occurence.  Such studies are intended to learn both how                  
              to prevent undesirable instabilitiers and also how to use                      
              instabilities to accomplish useful purposes.
