Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Understanding of men and women in American society encompasses            
              broad understanding of the attitudes of the diversity of racial and            
              ethnic groups within it.  One important aspect of that                         
              understanding is a knowledge of women's sex roles.  This Minority              
              Research Initiation Planning Grant studies comparatively the sex               
              role attitudes of married and unmarried African American women in              
              order to develop a conceptual framework for examining these                    
              attitudes which takes into consideration the social and historical             
              context of the experiences of African Americans.  Data from a                  
              national cross-sectional study of Black adults and a re-interview              
              subsample of this cross-sectional survey will be analyzed to assess            
              the significant predictors of the married and unmarried women's sex            
              role attitudes.                                                                
                                                                                             
                   This project will enhance our understanding of the factors                
              contributing to the development of attitudes about women's sex                 
              roles.  This project also provides an excellent opportunity for a              
              promising young scholar to lay the foundation for building a more              
              comprehensive model of sex role attitudes than currently exists.
