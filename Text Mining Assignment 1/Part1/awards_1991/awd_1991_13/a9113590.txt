Abstract    :
                   The primary object of this research effort is the                         
              formulation of a theory of sub-Doppler laser cooling that can                  
              be applied to a number of cases of experimental interest.  It                  
              is expected that considerable insight into laser cooling can                   
              be gained by establishing a connection between the underlying                  
              mechanisms responsible for both the very narrow resonances                     
              that can be observed in nonlinear spectroscopy and laser                       
              cooling below the Doppler limit.  It is hoped that the theory                  
              will help to explain existing experimental data and will serve                 
              as a guide for future experiments.
