Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific program to                   
              study the properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, and sea-ice              
              on a transect between Murmansk, USSR and Nome, Alaska.  It will                
              measure variations in temperature and salinity through                         
              Conductivity/Temperature/Depth (CTD) survey, and otherwise                     
              investigate density structure and the water column dynamics,                   
              using Expendable Current Profiler (XCP) measurements.  This                    
              proposal will obtain fundamental information that has never                    
              before been available as well as provide indispensable                         
              collaborative information for a larger biological component of                 
              the science program.  Two Polar Ocean Profiling buoys will be                  
              deployed during the ships transit that will make an existing                   
              network of autonomous buoys complete and that will eventually                  
              allow calculation of the Arctic Ocean water mass volume and its                
              seasonal and interannual variations.
