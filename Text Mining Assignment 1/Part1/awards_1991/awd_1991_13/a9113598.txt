Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will establish a Research Training Group in Linking                 
              Levels of Ecological Organization at the Kellogg Biological                    
              Station of Michigan State University.  The faculty group has 11                
              members drawn from 5 departments.  The funds awarded will provide              
              stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees, will                 
              support research participation by undergraduate students, and                  
              will defray part of the cost of the trainees' research.  In                    
              addition, funds will be used to purchase specialized research                  
              equipment to be used by the trainees, for trainee travel to other              
              institutions for specialized training not available at Michigan                
              State, and to bring investigators from other research and                      
              academic institutions to the Kellogg Station for seminars and                  
              workshops.  University and other resources will augment the funds              
              provided by NSF in most of these categories, and will help extend              
              the program to include the participation of high school students.              
                                                                                             
              The need to train scientists who can synthesize across levels of               
              ecological organization is significant and growing.  If anything,              
              the pressing issues of global change and of maintenance of                     
              biological diversity appear to make such training increasingly                 
              urgent.  This program will provide just such training, taking                  
              advantage of the techniques and concepts of researchers who                    
              address a variety of evolutionary and ecological problems at the               
              level of genes, individual organisms, populations, communities,                
              ecosystems or entire landscapes.
