Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary aim of this research is to investigate the structural              
              properties of fluid surfaces (such as water, methanol, and carbon              
              tetrachloride and their vapors) on length scales varying from                  
              several angstroms to microns.  In addition, investigation will                 
              focus on Langmuir monolayers, thermotropic liquid crystals, and                
              lytropic liquid crystals.  The techniques of x-ray reflectivity and            
              diffraction will be used in this work because no alternative                   
              technique is available to acquire this information.  Graduate                  
              students will conduct their work at the Harvard MRL facility and               
              the Brookhaven National Laboratory.
