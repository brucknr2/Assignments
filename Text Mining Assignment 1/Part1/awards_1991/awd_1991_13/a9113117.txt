Abstract    :
                   This work in theoretical nuclear physics will investigate                 
              a new chiral quark-meson model of the nucleon.  In this model                  
              the chiral meson fields carry a composite structure due to                     
              their generation from quark fields as propagating vacuum                       
              fluctuations.  There is a natural place in the model for an                    
              absolute confining mechanism that does not require an                          
              auxiliary field.
