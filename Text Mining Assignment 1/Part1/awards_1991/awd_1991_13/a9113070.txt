Abstract    :
              This grant will allow the American Society for Engineering                     
              Education (ASEE) to host three representatives of the USSR                     
              Association of Engineering Universities at the ASEE Annual                     
              conference.  ASEE's Executive Director will then travel to the                 
              USSR to meet with the USSR Association of Engineering                          
              Universities.  The purpose of these visits will be to begin                    
              developing the substance of programs specified in an agreement                 
              signed by the two organizations on November 25, 1990 in                        
              Washington, DC.  This agreement provides for the exchange and                  
              cooperation of US/USSR educators for the purpose of furthering                 
              engineering education in both countries.
