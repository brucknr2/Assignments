Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                          
              Organometallic Program in support of the research of Dr. Roger                 
              Willett. The research will address the structural, electronic                  
              spectroscopic, magnetochemical and EPR properties of monomeric,                
              dimeric and higher-order Cu(II), Mn(II) and Ni(II)-halide                      
              complexes. An emphasis will be a study of the variation of the                 
              geometric and electronic structure of the complexes with                       
              temperature, either by phase transitions or by dynamic                         
              Jahn-Teller interactions. The principle experimental techniques                
              utilized will be X-ray diffraction methods, EPR and NMR.

              This research involves the study of certain fundamental                        
              properties and processes in mixed organic/inorganic crystalline                
              materials. Studies will focus on the changes that occur in                     
              these systems as the temperature is varied.  Included are                      
              materials that exhibit continuum properties in the crystalline                 
              phase and that mimic the physical properties of lipids and                     
              other phenomena.
