Abstract    :
                   This award allow the establishment of a regional archival                 
              center for early life history stages of fishes (eggs and larvae)               
              of the Pacific Northwest at the University of Washington.  The                 
              project will consolidate and curate 7 individual collections now               
              at UW (1 at School of Fisheries; 2 at School of Oceanography; 1                
              at Int. Pac. Halibut Comm.) and a t government agencies (3 at                  
              Alaska Fisheries Science Center) in the Seattle area.  The                     
              consolidated collection -- 48,000 lots -- will be the third                    
              largest fish egg and larval holdings in the U.S.  The collection               
              transfers have the written approval and recommendation of the                  
              USNM, the National Marine Fisheries Service of NOAA and the IPHC.              
              The USNM is not in position to accommodate these collections;                  
              but, as required by law, a representative collection of the                    
              holdings at the National Marine Fisheries Service will be made                 
              available to the USNM.  Each of the separate collections will now              
              receive far better curatorial care and more research use in the                
              archival center.  The increased availability of a reorganized,                 
              integrated collection will help fill the demand for larval fish                
              specimens for research and education in ecology, systematics,                  
              embryology and morphology and will also promote ontogenetic                    
              studies.
