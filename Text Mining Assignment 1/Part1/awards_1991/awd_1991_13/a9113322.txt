Abstract    :
                   This award supports upgrading equipment and data                          
              communications lines for MICHNET, a statewide network operating                
              among higher education institutions in the state of Michigan.                  
                   The MICHNET system has been operating since 1973 utilizing                
              X.25 network protocols.  Current traffic volume, however, has                  
              exceeded the capacity of the hardware and software and modern data             
              communications equipment supporting TCP/IP is being installed.                 
              Also, the lines comprising the statewide backbone are being                    
              upgraded to 1.5 million bits per second from the current speed of              
              56,000 bits per second to accommodate the larger volume of traffic.            
                   A primary goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative              
              projects and sharing of resources between institutions, including              
              those outside the state.  MICHNET will provide operations                      
              management and information services and it will give the                       
              participating universities a connection to the NSFNET, a high speed            
              (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network.  The             
              project will also support an upgrade of central site redundant and             
              equipment.                                                                     
                   The universities need greater functionality and network speed             
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail             
              system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.             
              This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore                   
              innovative educational resources.
