Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program explores the basic phenomena that lead to the                     
              development of crystallographic texture during hot deformation of              
              rapidly-quenched neodymium-iron-boron magnets.  Emphasis is placed             
              on two aspects of the texture: (1) the intergranular phases in the             
              magnets, how they differ in magnets made by conventional sintering             
              compared to rapid solidification, and how they depend on the                   
              presence of additional alloying elements such as copper.  High                 
              resolution electron microscopy and Auger spectroscopy are used to              
              explore these topics. (2) Because the driving force for texture                
              formation is believed to be a difference in elastic energy between             
              grains of different orientation under stress, data is needed on the            
              elastic constants above ambient temperatures.  Sintered magnets                
              that are properly oriented are to be measured to determine the                 
              elastic constants parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis as a                
              function of temperature, up to 700 degrees Celsius.

              Texture plays an important role in the properties of magnetic metal            
              alloys.  This research provides important information on the                   
              processing factors controlling texture in an important class of                
              magnet alloys.
