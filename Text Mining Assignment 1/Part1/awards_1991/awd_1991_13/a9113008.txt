Abstract    :
                   This project is collaborative with David D. Yao of Columbia               
              University.  The principal investigators developed the notions of              
              strong stochastic convexity and directional convexity which are                
              sample-path based structural properties essential to the analysis              
              and optimal design of stochastic discrete event systems in general             
              and queueing networks in particular.  This project focuses on                  
              properties relating to structural and policy changes in queueing               
              networks.  To model and understand these changes, notions of                   
              monotonicity and convexity do not apply directly.  New concepts and            
              new machineries along the lines of stochastic rearrangement and                
              stochastic majorization will be developed.  These notions provide              
              mathematical support for "pairwise interchange" arguments that are             
              widely used in scheduling, control, and resource allocation.                   
              Preliminary studies have demonstrated their usefulness and                     
              effectiveness in dealing with structural and policy changes.                   
              Furthermore, these properties are natural extension of stochastic              
              convexity.                                                                     
                   A new, unified hierarchy of (sample-path based) second-order              
              properties in queueing networks appears to be now emerging.                    
              Together, these properties will support the (static) parametric                
              design of queueing networks, and dynamic scheduling and control.
