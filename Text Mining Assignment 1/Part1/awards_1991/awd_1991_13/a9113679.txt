Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research examines the fragmentation of dendrites during                   
              solidification and their subsequent effects on refining the cast               
              microstructure.  Possible mechanisms of dendrite fracture in the               
              semi-liquid/semi-solid state are examined to determine effects of              
              electromagnetic-induced fluid flow and/or mechanical-driven flow on            
              the process.  Modeling of the flow behavior for simple and more                
              complex geometries is planned.  Cast geometries are employed that              
              permit calculation of the interdendritic flow imposed by the force             
              field.  Optimum methods for dendrite breakup are expected to result            
              from the research.

              This research has potential future application in the casting of               
              metal alloys with refined microstructures.  Fine grained castings              
              are expected to have improved mechanical properties over                       
              conventional castings.
