Abstract    :
              This research project addresses an                                             
              important area in automatic                                                    
              control, namely, robust adaptive                                               
              control.  The primary goal is to                                               
              draw a strong analogy between                                                  
              concepts from immunology and                                                   
              concepts from adaptive neurocontrol                                            
              and to use this analogy to enhance                                             
              the current practices in adaptive                                              
              neurocontrol.  Immunology is the

              against external attacks.  The                                                 
              science of immunology has many                                                 
              parallels to the robust adaptive                                               
              control problem.  This project                                                 
              assumes that there is a  match                                                 
              between the concepts of

              match is properly understood, there                                            
              is a great potential for scaling up                                            
              current trends in adaptive

              realization of this match.

              the above areas are proposed to be                                             
              used to test the concepts presented                                            
              in this proposal.  These are: (a)                                              
              adaptive control in man-machine

              will bring out the essential
