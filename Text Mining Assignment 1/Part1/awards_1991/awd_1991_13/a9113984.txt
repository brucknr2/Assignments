Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The recent wave of democratic transitions in Latin America, Eastern            
              and Central Europe, the Pacific Rim and elsewhere is producing                 
              revolutionary changes in the political structures and political                
              life of many nations.  The events have forced social scientists to             
              rethink our ideas about political change and to reconsider the                 
              lessons of earlier academic debates about the social, cultural, and            
              economic contexts in which Democracy can take root.                            
                                                                                             
              This award supports a series of faculty/student workshops that will            
              examine alternative theoretical models as they apply to the lessons            
              of democracy and democratization. The workshop will bring together             
              some of the leading scholars in the field and provide an intense               
              training experience for the next generation of scholars interested             
              in these most important topics.
