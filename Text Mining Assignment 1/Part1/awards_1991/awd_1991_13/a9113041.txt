Abstract    :
              This work investigates the effects of discourse context on                     
              explanations in tutorial settings.  When human tutors engage in                
              dialogue, they freely exploit all aspects of the mutually known                
              context, including the previous discourse.  Utterances that do                 
              not draw on previous discourse seem awkward, unnatural, or even                
              incoherent.  Previous discourse must be taken into account in                  
              order to relate new information effectively to recently conveyed               
              material and to avoid repeating old material that would distract               
              the student from what is new.  Strategies for using the discourse              
              history in generating utterances are of great importance                       
              toresearch in natural language generation for tutorial                         
              applications.  The goal of this work is to produce a                           
              computational model of how tutors exploit the discourse history                
              in instructional settings, and to implement this model in an                   
              intelligent tutoring system that maintains a dialogue history and              
              uses it in planning its explanations.
