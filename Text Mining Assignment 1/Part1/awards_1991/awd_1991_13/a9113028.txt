Abstract    :
                   This project, supported under the "Small Grants for                       
              Exploratory Research" program, is a prelude to a detailed                      
              accurate investigation of single quantum annihilation of                       
              positrons.  A preliminary experiment is planned using the                      
              accelerated positron beam of the Brookhaven National Laboratory                
              Dynamitron facility.  A principal objective is to test a                       
              coincidence technique in the detection of the annihilation                     
              quanta, in an effort to reduce laboratory background count rates.              
              On the basis of these trial runs the feasibility of an expanded                
              experimental program can be assessed.
