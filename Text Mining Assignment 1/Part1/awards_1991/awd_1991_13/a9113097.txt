Abstract    :
              The chemistry of 1,3-silametallacycles of the early transition                 
              metals will be studied in order to increase our understanding                  
              of metal-assisted carbon-carbon bond forming reactions and                     
              intramolecular rearrangements.  Three main areas will be                       
              explored: 1) mechanistic studies of carbon monoxide and iso-                   
              nitrile insertions and rearrangements, 2) the use of these                     
              stabilized metallacyclobutanes to access cationic zirconium                    
              complexes for Ziegler-Natta polymerization, and 3) the develop-                
              ment of synthetic organic methodologies based on metallacyclic                 
              enolates.  Mechanistic, synthetic, structural, and                             
              spectroscopic studies will be augmented with molecular orbital                 
              calculations.                                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                    
              metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Jeffrey L.                     
              Peterson of West Virginia University will use early transition                 
              metals to effect the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds.  The                
              results may have relevance to practical methods of forming more                
              complex and useful organic molecules from cheap, simpler                       
              molecules such as carbon monoxide.
