Abstract    :
                   This project will use meta-analysis to synthesize the                     
              results of independent ecological studies.  Meta-analysis is a                 
              statistical approach that has had a profound impact on the                     
              resolution of longstanding questions in other fields, but has not              
              previously been used in ecology.  The research will extend                     
              existing meta-analysis techniques taken from the social sciences               
              and epidemiology to analyze ecological data and to address                     
              ecological questions.  Methods currently used to synthesize                    
              research results in ecology are logically, conceptually, and                   
              statistically flawed.  Meta-analysis offers a sounder                          
              alternative, but the statistical models available are inadequate               
              for many important tasks in ecology, such as examining                         
              interactions among factors.  The proposed study will develop                   
              meta-analytic statistical models from ecological research (mixed               
              models and factorial designs).  These models will then be used to              
              resolve a specific question, that of the effects of competition                
              in the presence and in the absence of predators.  Meta-analysis                
              can potentially change the way conclusions are drawn from the                  
              outcome of experiments in ecology, and may have a major influence              
              on the way data are collected, analyzed and interpreted in this                
              field.
