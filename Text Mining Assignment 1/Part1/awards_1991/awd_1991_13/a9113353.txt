Abstract    :
                Research equipment will be put in place for new                              
              experimental soil dynamics and earthquake engineering                          
              research.  The resonant column apparatus and the Fast                          
              Fourier Transform (FFT) signal analysis workstation will be                    
              used to evaluate damping of soils using a new nonlinear                        
              technique, and to study the time-dependent nature of dynamic                   
              soil behavior under earthquake excitation conditions.  The                     
              resonant column device is capable of applying both                             
              sinusoidal and random excitation for the purpose of                            
              determining dynamic soil properties.  The FFT workstation                      
              includes a powerful dual-channel FFT spectrum analyzer, a                      
              waveform recorder, a digital oscilloscope, and an IBM-                         
              compatible DOS computer, all integrated in one system.  The                    
              proposed equipment will provide the Civil Engineering                          
              Department with a necessary facility to improve its research                   
              capability.  With the initial involvement of eight minority                    
              students and future involvement of additional minority                         
              students the proposed project will enhance the                                 
              representation of minorities in engineering at the                             
              University of the District of Columbia.
