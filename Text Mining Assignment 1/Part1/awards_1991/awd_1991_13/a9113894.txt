Abstract    :
              This project is for a planning grant to facilitate development of              
              a more extended comparative research project on the process of                 
              adoption in the United States and Sweden.  The project will                    
              investigate the connections between (1) global market processes of             
              economic exploitation (specifically the commodification of poor and            
              Third World children); (2) transnational legal processes of                    
              juridical production and expansion (specifically the expansion of              
              legal ideologies and practices through the activities of legal                 
              practitioners involved in handling adoption); and (3) local                    
              practices, epistemologies, and policies surrounding adoption in the            
              United States and Sweden.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The planning phase of the research will involve interviews with                
              attorneys, social workers, staff, and officials of adoption                    
              agencies and organizations in the United States and Sweden to                  
              explore commonalities and variation in the assumptions informing               
              adoption practice and to develop more formal instruments for                   
              subsequent, extended interviews.  In addition, this phase of the               
              research will involve a review of appropriate literature on                    
              adoption, on legal practitioners, and on the economic, cultural,               
              and political contexts of adoption in each country.                            
                                                                                             
              The research will contribute to our understanding of theories of               
              legal pluralism as the interpenetration of global (world-system)               
              processes with local knowledge and practices.  The approach will               
              set in question the polarity of "official" law and plural social               
              fields by examining the ways global processes both appropriate and             
              are domesticated by "local" and regional processes.
