Abstract    :
                   This proposal describes PREPnet, the Pennsylvania Research                
              and Economic Partnership Network, which presently links thirty-                
              nine colleges, universities, government, and private sector                    
              research and education enterprises to each other and to the                    
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National               
              Backbone network.                                                              
                   PREPnet plans to expand its capacity for connecting                       
              education and research institutions and to extend its services                 
              into new regions of the state.  This should encourage smaller                  
              institutions to take advantage of information resources available              
              on PREPnet itself or through the NSFNET.                                       
                   The items proposed for NSF support include:                               
                   -Expansion of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia network hubs;                   
                   -Creation of a new network hub in State College, PA;                      
                   -Creation of a new network hub in Meadville, PA;                          
                   -Terminal servers for connecting very small member                        
              institutions at a reasonable cost;                                             
                   -Personnel for outreach, marketing, and support of new                    
              members; and                                                                   
                   -Compensation to the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center for                 
              NSFNET gateway and network support services.
