Abstract    :
              This proposal focusses on two conflicting objectives in group                  
              decision making: the technical quality of the decision and the                 
              degree to which the decision is accepted by group members.  It also            
              focusses on the interaction between problem content and the                    
              problem-solving process(i.e., specifically on how group decision               
              making in problems with moral content differs from group decision              
              making in problems without moral content.)  The researchers also               
              propose evaluating group decision making by the degree to which                
              the problem in question is solved and not by the technical quality             
              of the solution.
