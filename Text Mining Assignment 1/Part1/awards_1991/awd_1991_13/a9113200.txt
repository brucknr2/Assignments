Abstract    :
              Dr. Tai-Ping Liu, Stanford University, and Dr. Long-an Ying                    
              of Peking University will collaborate on shock wave theory.                    
              Professor Ying is a leading mathematical scientist in                          
              Beijing.  He has worked on numerical analysis, partial                         
              differential equations and mathematical modeling, and                          
              pioneered the concept of infinite elements in computations.                    
              Recent work has been on the qualitative behavior of combustion                 
              waves and finite difference for hyperbolic partial differential                
              equations.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Collaboration will focus on the behavior of discrete shocks,                   
              the effects of dissipation on combustion waves, and other                      
              issues on the nonlinear stability and instability of nonlinear                 
              waves for hyperbolic and viscous conservation laws.  Professor                 
              Ying's experience in numerical analysis and inviscid combustion                
              waves complement well the PI's interest in dissipations for                    
              conservation laws.
