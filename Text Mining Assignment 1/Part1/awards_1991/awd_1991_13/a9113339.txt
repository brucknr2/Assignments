Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding necessary for the                
              acquisition of an electron microprobe analysis system that will be             
              installed in the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution            
              of Washington. The Carnegie Institution is committed to providing              
              the remaining funds for this acquisition.                                      
                   The electron microprobe system will be used primarily in                  
              research projects by the staff of the Geophysical Laboratory and               
              the neighboring Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. The rapid and             
              quantitative chemical analysis of major elements and many trace                
              elements in solids, with a spatial resolution in the range of                  
              microns, is essential in a wide spectrum of research in                        
              experimental and observational petrology, mineral physics, and                 
              crystallography undertaken at these two campuses of the Carnegie               
              Institution of Washington.
