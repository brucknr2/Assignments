Abstract    :
                   Digital replication is a new, rapid reverse engineering                   
              process for making highly detailed three dimensional electronic                
              models of physical objects through the use of X-Ray Computerized               
              Tomography (CT) scanning.  With current industrial CT technology,              
              Digital Replica of small objects (24 in3) can be generated in a few            
              hours.  The resulting surface model is accurate and captures all               
              part details, but it is not compatible with conventional computer              
              aided design (CAD) modeling systems.  The main objective of this               
              project is to develop CAD interfaces to organize the surface data              
              points into a more structured curve and surface representation,                
              such as the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) form, which can              
              be converted into standard CAD data exchange formats, such as IGES,            
              and PDES standards.                                                            
                   The system will provide a means to rapidly generate CAD models            
              from existing parts for which CAD data is missing or  incomplete.              
              In addition to the analytic representation for curve and surface,              
              the solid model requires the establishment of higher level                     
              geometrical and topological features for describing both                       
              external and internal structural shapes of the solid object.                   
              Features such as holes, slots or pockets, that may be easily                   
              identified in both inspection and manufacturing processes will be              
              used.
