Abstract    :
              This proposal will support the training of graduate students in                
              the areas of mathematics and biology.  The focus of the research               
              area will be the dynamics of heterogeneous ecological and                      
              evolutionary systems, with an emphasis on spatial and temporal                 
              heterogeneity.  The focus will be on deterministic and stochastic              
              models across broad organizational and temporal scales. Students               
              will be expected to gain expertise in either deterministic or                  
              stochastic mathematical techniques, in computational methods and               
              statistics, and in an area of specialization in biology.                       
              Students may major in one of several biological fields, with a                 
              formal minor in a mathematical field or they may major in one of               
              the mathematical fields, while undertaking field or laboratory                 
              research, and satisfying the formal requirement for a biology                  
              minor.  Students will be trained through an integrated program,                
              involving mathematicians, ecologists, and evolutionary biologist               
              with a demonstrated capacity to cross the boundaries between                   
              their disciplines.
