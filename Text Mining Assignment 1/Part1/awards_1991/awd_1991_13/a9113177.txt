Abstract    :
              The use of geosynthetic materials in geotechnical engineering                  
              practice has increased greatly during the past decade.  Today,                 
              geosynthetic materials are used for filtration, drainage,                      
              separation, soil reinforcement, seepage control, and in many                   
              other applications.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this research program is to evaluate the              
              dynamic interface shear properties of different geosynthetic soil              
              systems.  The goals is to obtain needed information on the basic               
              behavior and performance of geosynthetic-soil systems, motivated               
              by applications in earthquake hazard mitigation, such as:  base                
              isolation from earthquake ground shaking, earth slopes reinforced              
              with geotextiles and geogrids, and geomembrane lined canals,                   
              reservoirs, tunnels and hazardous waste containment landfills.                 
              Attention is also addressed to the need for research and                       
              development of a reliable testing procedure for dynamic interface              
              properties.
