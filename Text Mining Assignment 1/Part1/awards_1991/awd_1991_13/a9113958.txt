Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation                
              to study the properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, and                   
              sea-ice on a transect between Murmansk, USSR and Nome, Alaska.                 
              It will measure radiative fluxes and complementary meteorological              
              data, ice type, melt pond coverage, ice concentration, and snow                
              structure.  These data would provide a unique data set that would              
              resolve long standing disputes about the effects of melt pond                  
              cover and other summer season phenomena on radiative fluxes.                   
              These studies of the surface energy budget, atmospheric radiation              
              and sea ice conditions will contribute to areas of research                    
              recognized as high priority within Arctic Ocean-Atmosphere-ice                 
              Interactions component of Arctic System Sciences (ARCSS).
