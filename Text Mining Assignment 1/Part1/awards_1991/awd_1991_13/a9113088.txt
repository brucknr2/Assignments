Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to being together                              
              robust control and algebraic topology.  It is argued that                      
              such robust control issues as structured singular values,                      
              multivariable phase margin, Kharitonov's theorem, etc.                         
              receive their natural and unifying formulation in the                          
              context of algebraic topology, as formulated by                                
              Poincare, Cartan, Eilenberg, and many others.  The                             
              central mathematical issue is whether the mapping of                           
              the high dimensional manifold of structured                                    
              uncertainties into the Nyquist template commutes with                          
              the boundary.  While in the simple Kharitonov case it                          
              does, in the over-whelming majority of situations the                          
              Nyquist mapping does not commute with the boundary.                            
              However, the simplicial approximation theorem                                  
              provides us with an approximate Nyquist map that does                          
              commute with the boundary.  Fast implementation of                             
              the simplicial approximation theorem opens the road to                         
              a variety of fast, "simplicial" algorithms.  Finally,                          
              performing some algebra on the simplicial                                      
              approximation yield the "topography" of the stability                          
              boundary, that can be very complicated.
