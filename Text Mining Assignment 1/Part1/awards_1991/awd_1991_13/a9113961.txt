Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic                      
              environment and its role in global change which is promoted                    
              by NSF's Arctic System Science Program.  It is a three year                    
              pilot study for management of data required for and produced                   
              by the Ocean-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions element of the                        
              ARCSS Program.  The goal of the project is to provide a                        
              central access point for archival and distribution of data                     
              resulting from ARCSS research.  The data management project                    
              will include the following products:                                           
              1) development of a matrix inventory of data required for                      
              process and modeling studies; 2) coordination and                              
              facilitation of data exchange among PIs, including                             
              development of guidelines on data set formats and                              
              documentation for data exchange and archival; 3) development                   
              of plans to interface ARCSS data sets with existing national                   
              and international data centers and research programs; and 4)                   
              presentation to ARCSS Project Management of a plan for                         
              distribution of data directories and key data sets on                          
              appropriate media.
