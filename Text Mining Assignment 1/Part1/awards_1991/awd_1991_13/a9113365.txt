Abstract    :
              The aim of the research is to address the nature of sub-Tg                     
              relaxations in some high-temperature glassy polymers.  The                     
              relaxation behaviors of polycarbonates and other rigid aromatic                
              backbone glassy polymers will be investigated.  The low-temperature            
              relaxation of bisphenol-A polycarbonate has an extensive in-chain              
              cooperative character.  This cooperative motion is thought to be               
              the key to polycarbonate's superior mechanical properties.  The                
              origin of this in-chain cooperativity and the relaxation behavior              
              of other kinds of glassy polymers can be better understood by using            
              tailored molecular architectures together with dynamic mechanical              
              measurements.  Once the origin of cooperative motion is understood,            
              an important question will be answered:  How does the scale of this            
              cooperative motion affect intermolecular interactions?  Dynamic                
              bulk relaxation experiments will be used to address this question.             
              Another question to be answered in the proposed research deals with            
              how the scale of cooperative motion affects the mechanical                     
              properties of the polymer in terms of ductility and brittleness.               
              Through this research, the relationships between molecular                     
              structure, relaxation and mechanical properties will be further                
              clarified and the results can be used as guidelines to design and              
              synthesize new high-temperature ductile polymers with desirable                
              properties.
