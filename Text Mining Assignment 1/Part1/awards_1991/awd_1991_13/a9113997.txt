Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Hungary physics research                      
              project between Dr. Aaron Galonsky of Michigan State                           
              University and Dr. Ferenc Deak of the Central Physics                          
              Institute, Budapest, Hungary, is to study nucleus-nucleus                      
              collisions which produce hot zones.  For low projectile                        
              energies the dominant mode of cooling is neuron emission,                      
              but fragments are occasionally emitted too.  During the                        
              cooling of these zones, changes occur in both the kinetic                      
              energy spectra and the distribution of internal excitation                     
              energy of such fragments.  Using a colinear neutron-                           
              fragment coincidence technique, the researchers plan to                        
              collect experimental information on the dependence of                          
              internal energy on kinetic energy as a means of testing                        
              de-excitation models.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This project in nuclear physics fulfills the program                           
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                     
              combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas                      
              of strong mutual interest and competence.
