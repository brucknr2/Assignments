Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports collaborative research in statistical           
              mechanics between Fa Y. Wu, Northeastern University with Jean-                 
              Marie Maillard, University of Paris.  They will collaborate on                 
              models of critical point phenomena, such as boiling and freezing,              
              and phase transitions.  They will examine the chiral Potts model,              
              gauge transformations, other 3-state vertex models and the theory              
              of transmissivity as applied to these models.  The investigators will          
              focus on exact solutions, but will also utilize numerical approaches           
              and computer simulation, which is important to finding exact                   
              results. Analytical studies and computer simulations will be                   
              performed by Wu and Maillard on massive parallel computers.                    
                                                                                             
              Critical point phenomena and phase transitions are active areas of             
              research in condensed matter theory.  This work also impacts                   
              theoretical physics and applied mathematics.  Dr. Wu is a                      
              theoretician.  He will provide theoretical guidance and analytical             
              expertise.  Dr. Maillard is experienced in computer simulations on             
              the chiral Potts model and other 3-state vertex models.  The project           
              will benefit from their complementary expertise and parallel                   
              computer facilities.
