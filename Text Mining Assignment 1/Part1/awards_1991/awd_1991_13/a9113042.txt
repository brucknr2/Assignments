Abstract    :
              This award supports Lawrence Fagg and several others of the                    
              Catholic University of America (CUA) to collaborate with Achim                 
              Richter and other physicists at the superconducting electron                   
              accelerator facility of the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the                
              Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. Several years ago                 
              the CUA group designed and built what was then the only low                    
              energy 180 degree electron scattering system in the world.  It was             
              installed at the Microtron Facility of the University of Illinois at           
              Urbana-Champaign and operated successfully to obtain data on ten               
              nuclei ranging from Carbon-13 to Gallium-71.  However, in 1990                 
              the Microtron Facility was shut down, terminating a very                       
              productive line of nuclear research.  The CUA group arranged to                
              ship the scattering system to Darmstadt, Germany for installation              
              and use there.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The support provided by this award will enable the CUA group to                
              travel to Germany to complete the installation and testing of the              
              scattering system over the next few months.  Then they will be                 
              able to begin a series of collaborative experiments using the system           
              to study low multipolarity magnetic transitions in several selected            
              nuclei, including Helium-3, Neon-21, and Krypton-86.  The system               
              they built has a unique capability for investigating such transitions          
              as well as ground-state magnetic structure.
