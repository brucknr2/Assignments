Abstract    :
                   Westminster College requests support from NSF for connection              
              of its campus network to WESTnet.  Westnet is the midlevel                     
              network located in the state of Utah which will provide                        
              operations management and information services and it will give                
              Westminster College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to                
              the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)                    
              National Backbone network.                                                     
                   The College needs greater functionality and network speed to              
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
