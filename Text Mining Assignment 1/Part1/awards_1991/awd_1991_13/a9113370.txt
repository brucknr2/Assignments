Abstract    :
              This award funds research on a class of multilayer perceptron-                 
              like neural networks for classification problems.  The algorithm               
              uses linear programming methods to incrementally generate hidden               
              layers in a restricted higher-order perception, which is                       
              trainable in polynomial time.  The research will investigate                   
              extensions of the algorithm to address classification problems                 
              with large training sets, which normally take a long time to                   
              converge.  Behavior of the algorithm will be evaluated on                      
              representative problems from computer vision and robotics.
