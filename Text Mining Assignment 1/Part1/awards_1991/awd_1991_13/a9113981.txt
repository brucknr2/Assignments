Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic                      
              environment and its role in global change which is promoted                    
              by NSF's Arctic System Science Program.  It is a three year                    
              project utilize existing data sets and models in the                           
              evaluation heat and salt transfer at the ice-water interface                   
              and to gain fundamental insights into the roles of leads and                   
              thin ice in these processes.  A model for the distribution                     
              of shortwave energy in ice and lead systems, combined with                     
              models of turbulent transfer in the upper ocean, will be                       
              utilized in the analyses of existing data and to quantify                      
              spatial and temporal variations in the flux of heat energy                     
              from the Arctic OCean to the sea ice within the Arctic                         
              Basin.  Other simulations will explore the relationship                        
              between summer ice conditions and mixed layer temperature,                     
              long-term implications of seasonal variations in the flux of                   
              heat from the ocean to sea ice, and possible situations that                   
              could lead to a disappearance of the arctic ice pack.
