Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study is an investigation of the mechanisms of heat                       
              transfer associated with plume formation occurring during the                  
              interaction of laser radiation with metal targets.  The                        
              primary objective of the study is the development of                           
              techniques which can be used to determine the relative                         
              importance of plume absorption, scattering, and emission on                    
              coupling of laser energy into metal targets.  The methods used                 
              include high speed photography, target temperature                             
              measurement, plume light scattering and transmission                           
              measurements, and calibrated plume emission spectroscopy.  A                   
              pulsed Nd-YAG laser is used as the primary source of incident                  
              laser radiation at flux levels of 105 W/cm2 and greater.                       
              Aluminum and aluminum alloy materials are used as targets.                     
                                                                                             
              Another objective of this study is the investigation of the                    
              role of the assist gas on plume ionization and coupling of                     
              laser energy into the workpiece.  The influence of molecular                   
              oxygen on degree of plume ionization is studied by performing                  
              tests in various atmospheres with and without molecular                        
              oxygen.  The significance of this study is that a clearer                      
              understanding of the heat transfer mechanisms associated with                  
              plume formation is expected to be obtained.  This study will                   
              help accomplish the long term goal of this research program                    
              which is to provide an understanding of heat transfer                          
              mechanisms in laser target interaction so that lasers may be                   
              utilized to their full advantage in materials processing.
