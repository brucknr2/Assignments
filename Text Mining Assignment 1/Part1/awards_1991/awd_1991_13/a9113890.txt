Abstract    :
                   This grant provides partial support for the 1991 Gordon                   
              Research Conference on Nuclear Chemistry, to be held in New                    
              London, New Hampshire, 24-28 June.  In addition to the usual                   
              topics related to nuclear spectroscopy and reactions discussed                 
              in this series of conferences, there will be special sessions                  
              on superdeformation, nuclear astrophysics, and nuclear physics                 
              with radioactive beams.
