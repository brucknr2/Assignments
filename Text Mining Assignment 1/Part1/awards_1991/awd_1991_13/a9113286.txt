Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Waymouth                   
              will investigate the mechanism and stereochemistry of                          
              stereospecific catalysis and cyclopolymerization with Group IV                 
              metallocenes. Specific aims are as follows: (i) to develop                     
              detailed understanding of the mechanism and stereochemistry of                 
              cyclopolymerization with homogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts,                  
              (ii) to exploit the cyclopolymerization methodology to                         
              synthesize a variety of main-chain chiral polymers, and (iii)                  
              to apply mechanistic principles for the design of second                       
              generation metallocene catalysts for olefin hydrogenation,                     
              polymerization, and diolefin cyclization reactions.                            
              %%%                                                                            
              Although Ziegler and Natta announced their discovery of                        
              heterogeneous catalysis nearly 40 years ago, surprisingly                      
              little is known about the mechanism of these reactions. Dr.                    
              Waymouth has developed a new class of soluble catalysts that                   
              offer the potential for gaining new mechanistic insight into                   
              polymerization reactions. It is likely that an increased level                 
              of understanding of polymerization mechanisms will result from                 
              Dr. Waymouth's investigations. This, in turn, is expected to                   
              lead to the development of valuable new synthetic polymers.
