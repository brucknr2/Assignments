Abstract    :
                   A laboratory study of smoke from controlled combustion of a               
              sample of Kuwait crude oil will measure cloud condensation                     
              nucleus/condensation nucleus concentrations and ratios;                        
              composition, particle size and fractal dimensions.  Similiar                   
              analysis will also be undertaken of field samples of smoke                     
              collected by the Meteorological Research Flight in early April.                
              Results will be applied to possible cloud interactions of the                  
              soot to provide a basis to estimate the removal rate by cloud and              
              precipitation and radiation changes.  This study will suggest                  
              priorities for flight measurements to assess the climatic aspects              
              of the Kuwait oil fires.
