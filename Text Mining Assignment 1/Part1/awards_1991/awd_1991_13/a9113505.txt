Abstract    :
              This is a SGER proposal on laser atomization from a liquid                     
              surface, with potential medical applications.  The P.I. will                   
              investigate the feasibility of generating aerosols with                        
              controlled size distribution (between 1 and 5 microns) from                    
              drug solutions used in aerosol therapy, without compromising                   
              the chemical integrity of the solution.  Preliminary studies                   
              indicate that the particles should be in the 1 to 2 micron                     
              size range to maximize the effectiveness of aerosol therapy.                   
              If the aerosol is administered through a ventilation circuit,                  
              only 1 to 3% of the original volume of medication actually                     
              reaches the target site.  The long term objective is                           
              atomization of drugs directly within the large airways of                      
              lungs through the use of a fiber optic delivery system.  The                   
              proposed technique is the object of a U.S. patent claim                        
              "Forming Fine Particles".                                                      
                                                                                             
              The project will establish the validity of the proposed                        
              concept, which may have long-reaching implications in medical                  
              field and may lead to fundamental findings in the area of                      
              generating ultrafine aerosols.
