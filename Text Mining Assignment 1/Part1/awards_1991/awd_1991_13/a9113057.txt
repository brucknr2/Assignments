Abstract    :
              Changing electromagnetic fields affect living                                  
              organisms but the mechanisms of these effects                                  
              are unknown.  This proposal is to examine the                                  
              hypothesis that the fields change the rate of                                  
              calcium diffusion through the cell membranes                                   
              by a mechanism involving cyclotron resonance.                                  
              The approach will be to investigate the                                        
              transport of calcium ions across artificial                                    
              membranes with different characteristics,                                      
              such as porosities and surface charges.  The                                   
              effects of the direction of the field on the                                   
              transport will be also examined.  This work                                    
              may provide important insight into the                                         
              mechanisms by which electromagnetic fields                                     
              affect ion transport.  Knowledge of these                                      
              mechanisms would have applications in both                                     
              medicine (electrically induced tissue                                          
              healing, for example) and industry (such as                                    
              separation technology).
