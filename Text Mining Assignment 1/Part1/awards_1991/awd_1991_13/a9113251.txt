Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nothing is more central to macroeconomics than the attempt to                  
              understand business cycles.  A large fraction of all                           
              macroeconomic research in recent years has been devoted to                     
              exploring the implications of models in which all households and               
              firms form expectations about the future rationally and act in                 
              the pursuit of well-defined objectives, and comparing these                    
              implications to observed facts about business cycles.  The                     
              contribution of this project comes from developing and studying                
              analytically business cycle models that are more consistent                    
              qualitatively and quantitatively with observed facts about                     
              business cycles.                                                               
                                                                                             
              More specifically, the project extends and solves analytically a               
              central set of business cycle models based on Professor Edward                 
              Prescott's Real Business Cycle Model.  The following elements are              
              added to this model:  distortionary taxation, more than one                    
              production sector, changes in the composition of government                    
              spending, more than one type of labor, time-nonseparabilities in               
              the utility, and sluggish price adjustment.  These elements                    
              capture important aspects of economic reality missing in other                 
              models of business cycles.
