Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of interfacial structure and                     
              dynamics.  During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant,              
              Professor Wirth and her students will investigate the dynamics and             
              orientational distributions of guest molecules interacting with                
              covalently bonded, monolayer organic film hosts.  The specific                 
              theme of this work is the control of guest behavior through                    
              structural design of the host monolayer.  An understanding of                  
              guest-host monolayer interactions will facilitate the design of                
              sensors for rapid and specific molecular recognition.  The                     
              particular aspects of host monolayer architecture being                        
              investigated in this project are the development of structurally               
              ordered monolayers, the control of defect shapes in dense                      
              monolayers, and the role of density in covalent, liquid crystal                
              monolayers.  The guest properties of orientation and rotational                
              diffusion dynamics in these host monolayers will be probed by                  
              picosecond fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence microscopy.                
              Professor Wirth and her students will derive corroborative data                
              from scanning tunneling microscopy and ellipsometric and contact               
              angle measurements.

              This research furthers the basic understanding of guest molecules              
              with covalently bound thin film hosts that is essential to the                 
              rational design of sensor devices which have a significant degree              
              of sensitivity and molecular selectivity.
