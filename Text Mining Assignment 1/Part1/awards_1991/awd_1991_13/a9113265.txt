Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Heiles will use the 85-foot telescope at the Hat Creek Radio               
              Observatory to conduct decimeter wavelength studies focussed on the            
              21-cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen.  The studies include                    
              measurement of interstellar magnetic fields using the Zeeman                   
              effect, studies of expanding shells with sensitive observations of             
              the line wings, studies of H-alpha emitting features in the 21-cm              
              line, and extensive mapping of interstellar structures.  Other                 
              interstellar work includes confirmation of a probable detection of             
              the 327 MHz line of neutral deuterium and a search for the 310 MHz             
              lines of deuterated hydroxyl.  Dr. Heiles will also continue an                
              intensive monitoring of the synchrotron emission of the planet                 
              Jupiter to measure the properties of the probable short-term                   
              variability which he may have recently discovered.
