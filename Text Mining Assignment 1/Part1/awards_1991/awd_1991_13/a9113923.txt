Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This U.S.-Bulgaria research project in chemistry                               
              is between Dr. D.M. Roundhill of Tulane                                        
              University and Dr. K. Troev of the Central                                     
              Laboratory for Polymers, Sofia.  The researchers'                              
              previous collaboration has shown that the                                      
              reaction of dialkyl phosphonates (RO)2PHO, with                                
              either amines or metal chlorides results in                                    
              dealkylation of the phosponate, and the formation                              
              of an alkylammonium or metal ion in salt of the                                
              monoalkyl phosponate anion (RO)PHO2.  This                                     
              project will synthesize new alkyl phosponate                                   
              anions for use as plant growth inhibitors and as                               
              catalysts for the synthesis of flame retardant                                 
              polymers.  By alkyl group transfer to an amine                                 
              functionality, lipophilic monoalkyl phosphonate                                
              anions can be incorporated into a water-soluble                                
              VP-VA copolymer.  The researchers will synthesize                              
              R4N?(RO)PHO2! and of complexes                                                 
              M(O2HP(OR))6(M=Co,Ni,Pd,Pt,Ru,Fe).  They propose                               
              to investigate whether these salts and complexes                               
              act as catalysts for the addition of dialkyl                                   
              phosphonates to aledhydes or ketones (Abramov                                  
              reaction), and alkense.  The products will be                                  
              tested for use as agricultural chemicals and as                                
              polymeric materials.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This project in chemistry fulfills the program                                 
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                                 
              enabling leading experts in the United States and                              
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents                                
              and pool resources in areas of strong mutual                                   
              interest and competence.
