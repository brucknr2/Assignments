Abstract    :
              Professor Van Hook is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                
              and Computational Chemistry Program to measure thermodynamic                   
              isotope effects in vapor and liquid phases.  Virial                            
              coefficients, vapor pressures, condensed phase partial molar                   
              volumes, compressibilities and expansivities, and the isotope                  
              effects on these properties will be measured between room                      
              temperature and the critical temperature, and from less than                   
              0.1 to 200 MPa.  In a second and complementary project,                        
              refractive index differences between isotopic isomers, and                     
              between liquids and solutions will be measured.  The                           
              theoretical analysis of the results will focus on the relation                 
              between intermolecular forces in the condensed phase and the                   
              molecular properties, especially the polarizability, and will                  
              include consideration of the contributions from isotope effects                
              from different normal mode vibrations.

              Systematic and accurate measurement of thermodynamic properties                
              is extremely important for the development of theories of                      
              intermolecular interactions in vapors, liquids, and solutions                  
              as well as for more practical reasons.  The current research                   
              program will produce precise data for small differences in                     
              thermodynamic properties which result from isotopic                            
              substitution.  This research will also provide some of the most                
              accurate thermodynamic data available on the reference                         
              compounds used.  The data produced will provide a valuable                     
              resource to the larger community of chemists and chemical                      
              engineers.
