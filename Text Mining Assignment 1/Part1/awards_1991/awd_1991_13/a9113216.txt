Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Inadequate security and privacy threaten the development of                    
              computer and communications networks.  There is a window of time               
              available now in which to act to rapidly develop policy guide                  
              lines consistent among the various national and international                  
              networks.  Delay in considering these issues will result in                    
              inadequate privacy and security, cancellation or rejection of                  
              some otherwise fine networks, or costly retrofits.                             
                                                                                             
              A workshop is proposed to address these policy questions,                      
              consider the adequacy of existing policy setting mechanisms, and               
              identify a number of legal issues which keep cropping up as                    
              networks expand.***
