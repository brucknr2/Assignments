Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University at                 
              Bloomington upgrade of its the x-ray diffraction laboratory.                   
              Among the areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by                  
              the upgrade are the following:                                                 
                                                                                             
              1)  3d metal carboxylate chemistry, with concentration of                      
              effort on Mn and Fe,                                                           
                                                                                             
              2)  early transition metal/sulfur chemistry, primarily of V,                   
                                                                                             
              3)  the study of paramagnetic hydride compounds,                               
                                                                                             
              4)  the compositional and structural characterization of                       
              plastic and disordered solids,                                                 
                                                                                             
              5)  dinuclear transition metal chemistry,                                      
                                                                                             
              6)  small molecule activation by alkoxide supported metal                      
              clusters,                                                                      
                                                                                             
              7)  molecular precursors in solid-state synthesis, and                         
                                                                                             
              8)  metallorganic polymers and liquid crystals.                                
                                                                                             
              Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful                      
              analytical method for structure determination of solids.  In                   
              synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic                  
              chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable                   
              tool to characterize molecular structure.  The information                     
              gained from the knowledge of the molecular composition and                     
              structure helps to develop new reactions of potentially general                
              interest in catalysis or synthesis.
