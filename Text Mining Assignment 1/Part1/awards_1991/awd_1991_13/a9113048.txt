Abstract    :
              This grant is to support experiments in turbulent flow.  The                   
              experiments are designed to permit a directo test of the basis                 
              underlying the Large-Eddy-Simulation scheme for numerically                    
              simulating turbulent flows.  Flow in the wake behind a                         
              circular cylinder, and turbulent flow behind a grid, will be                   
              investigated.  Filtering of the data will be utilized to                       
              models for the small scales.  The data will be examined for                    
              clues leading to improved for sub-grid turbulence.                             
              Large-Eddy-Simulation is increasingly utilized in the                          
              numerical simulation of complex turbulent flows.                               
              Clarification of its validity, and improvements in the subgrid                 
              models, will lead to improved accuracy in the modeling of                      
              these flows important to various engineering systems.
