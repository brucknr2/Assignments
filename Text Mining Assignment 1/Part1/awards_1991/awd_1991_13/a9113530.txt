Abstract    :
              This software capitalization project is to fund the reformatting               
              of the online text data, which exists as part of the Association               
              for Computational Linguistics Data Encoding Initiative, into a                 
              common SGML-based format and make it available to the research                 
              community at low cost and with minimal restrictions.  This is the              
              first of several collections which are being re-formatted.  The                
              project enables scaling up of natural language research so that                
              more realistic problems can be studied.  This is particularly                  
              relevant for applications in the recognition and analysis of text              
              and speech.  Existing generally-available text databases are too               
              small.  It is expensive and time consuming to obtain sufficient                
              text and to make it usable for research.  For individual                       
              researchers to duplicate this effort is wasteful.  A common                    
              database will permit published results to be replicated or                     
              extended.  There is joint funding for this project with other NSF              
              offices and with DARPA.
