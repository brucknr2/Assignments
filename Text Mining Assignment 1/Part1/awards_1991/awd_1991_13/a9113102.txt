Abstract    :
                   1991 Atmospheric Chemistry Gordon Research Conference                     
              Program topics for the 1991 Gordon Conference on Atmospheric                   
              Chemistry include global distributions and trends of atmospheric               
              species, surface exchange fluxes of trace species, gas phase                   
              photochemistry, heterogeneous and condensed phase processes,                   
              theoretical modeling and analysis, and policy and perspective.                 
              The program represents the best of national and international                  
              efforts in atmospheric chemistry and has been designed to so that              
              participants will gain a deep insight into both the state-of-the-              
              art and the outstanding challenges of atmospheric chemistry in                 
              1991.  Informal meetings of the National Research Council's                    
              Atmospheric Chemistry Committee and the Coordinating Committee                 
              and Convenors of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry                
              Program will also be held.  The Conference will be held in New                 
              Hampton, New Hampshire, 17 - 21 June, 1991.
