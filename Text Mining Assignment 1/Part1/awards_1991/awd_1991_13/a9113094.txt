Abstract    :
                   Dr. William Matthews is an aquatic ecologist at the                       
              University of Oklahoma.  He proposes to establish an aquatic                   
              research park adjacent to the University of Oklahoma's Biological              
              Station located along Lake Texoma, a large reservoir created                   
              along the Red and Washita Rivers.  Artificial streams would be                 
              constructed to simulate quiet pools of water interspersed with                 
              "riffle" intervals of more turbulent water.                                    
                   These artificial stream systems would be available for                    
              research by resident and visiting investigators.  The streams                  
              would be used for a diverse array of studies, including                        
              experiments on predator/prey interactions and population                       
              dynamics, factors influencing the composition of fish                          
              assemblages, and the role of animal populations in the                         
              decomposition of wood in streams.  These and other projects                    
              conducted at the Oklahoma Biological Station will greatly                      
              increase our understanding of the ecology of natural streams.
