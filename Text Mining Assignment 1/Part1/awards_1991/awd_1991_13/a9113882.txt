Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposal requests travel support for the attendance of                     
              selected U.S. and international scientists of a conference on                  
              synthetic microstructures in biologic research to be held in                   
              Williamsburg, Virginia in September of 1991.  The objective of                 
                                                                                             
              the conference is to provide an interdisciplinary forum to                     
              discuss state-of-the-art developments in synthetic                             
              microstructures.  The conference will focus on three areas:                    
                                                                                             
                     o  the fabrication of micron and sub-micron structures                  
              by                                                                             
              conventional techniques, by self assembly, or by other novel                   
              approaches,                                                                    
                     o  the characterization of such structures, and                         
                     o  the utilization of these structures for the solution                 
                                                                                             
              of complex biological of physical problems such as the area of
