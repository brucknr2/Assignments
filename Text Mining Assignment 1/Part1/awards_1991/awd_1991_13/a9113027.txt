Abstract    :
              Desalination of ocean water is a major way to provide fresh                    
              water to communities along coastal and arid regions.                           
              Desalination plants existing in these areas are typically                      
              either multi-stage flash evaporators or reverse osmosis                        
              operations.  While both methods have advantages, there are                     
              also disadvantages that affect their efficiency.  The use of a                 
              high frequency electric field for heating of salt water to                     
              accelerate evaporation would eliminate some of the                             
              disadvantages of the distillation methods of desalination.                     
              This method would reduce corrosion which is a major problem in                 
              the flash evaporators.  Furthermore, this will allow for a                     
              rapid on-off operation of the system which would give better                   
              utilization of electric facilities.                                            
                                                                                             
              In this project, the evaporation kinematics of streamlets of                   
              brine under the influence of 100mHz electric fields is being                   
              studied.  If the high frequency field significantly lowers the                 
              barrier to evaporation in the brine, this project may                          
              introduce a wholly new technology in the area of desalinating                  
              water for agriculture and human consumption.
