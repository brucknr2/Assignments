Abstract    :
                   The objective of this internship project is to evaluate the               
              implementation of concurrent engineering in a major communications             
              manufacturing facility.  In concurrent engineering, design,                    
              specifications, materials, and manufacturing processes are                     
              considered simultaneously in contrast to the present approach where            
              these functions are sequential and compartmentalized.                          
                   Specifically, this project will analyze the present system by             
              examining the history of a set of selected new products.  The                  
              problems that delayed the products and the manufacturing problems              
              that are associated with the products will be assessed.  Measures              
              to move in the direction of concurrent design will be explored.                
              Extension and implications for other manufacturing organizations               
              will also be documented.
