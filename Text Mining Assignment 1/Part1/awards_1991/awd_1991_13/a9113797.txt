Abstract    :
                   The objective of this internship is to develop a model-based              
              decision support system for aircraft requirements.  It is                      
              expected that the model base will be a 0-1 integer program that,               
              when solved, will provide a daily set of routings for the                      
              aircraft.  The primary objective of the model will be to minimize              
              the number of routings (and therefore the number of aircraft)                  
              required to cover all of the flight legs.                                      
                   Much of the work for this project will involve extensive                  
              interaction with industrial planners in order to develop a good                
              formulation for the model, and good interfaces with the system's               
              users, existing databases, and other problem areas.  In addition,              
              as a result of the principal investigator's interests, special                 
              attention will be given to the multiobjective aspects of the                   
              problem; for example, it may be desirable to consider tradeoffs                
              between the number of routes required to cover all of the flight               
              legs, and the balancing of aircraft among the different airports.              
              It is expected that this project will lead to the examination of               
              other complex logistical problems.  These problems include those               
              related to flow planning, maintenance scheduling, crew                         
              scheduling, and the provisioning of spare parts for aircraft.
