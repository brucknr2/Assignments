Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this proposal is to resume excavations at             
              a Pliocene site in the central Afar of Ethiopia, the Hadar site.               
              This site is one of the richest hominid sites in the world                     
              yielding, among other remains, the famous "Lucy" material which has            
              led to the naming of a new hominid species, Australopithecus                   
              afarensis.  This site was closed in the early 1980s pending the                
              formulation of new legislation governing excavations.  The                     
              Institute of Human Origins received permission to resume excavation            
              in 1990 and discovered 15 new hominid specimens.  In the field                 
              season proposed here, further surveys will be carried out to better            
              characterize the geological context of the site as well as renewing            
              operations at the hominid bearing locale A.L. 333.
