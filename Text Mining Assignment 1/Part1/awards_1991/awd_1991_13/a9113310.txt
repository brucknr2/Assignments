Abstract    :
                A graduate and an undergraduate student (both minorities)                    
              will work with a chemist at Clark Atlanta University in                        
              conducting comprehensive research to prepare and                               
              study the physical and mechanical properties of films and                      
              fibers.  This will be achieved by preparing polymers which                     
              are chemical precursors to poly (p-phenylene-2, 6-                             
              benzobisoxazole) (PBO) and poly (p-phenylene                                   
              benzobisthiazole) (PBT) which are normally very intractable                    
              and difficult to process.  The precursors will be designed                     
              to have higher solubility and lower melting points by                          
              decreasing the symmetry and preventing hydrogen bonding.                       
              Once processed into films or fibers the precursor polymers                     
              will be converted to PBO and PBT by high yield chemical                        
              transformations.                                                               
                The precursor polymers and polymers will be characterized by                 
              techniques including infrared microscopy and spectroscopy,                     
              and 1H, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, light                     
              scattering photometry, differential scanning calorimetry,                      
              thermogravimetric analysis, polarizing optical microscopy,                     
              gel permeation chromatography, solubility, viscometry and x-                   
              ray diffraction.  Physical testing, such as, tensile                           
              strength measurements will be performed on films and fibers                    
              made from the precursors and polymers, before and after                        
              transformation to PBT and PBO.
