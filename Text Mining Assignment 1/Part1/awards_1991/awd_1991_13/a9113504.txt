Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for the operation of                       
              the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of                          
              Engineering, National Research Council's Water Science                         
              Technology Board.  The Board provides a focal point for                        
              studies related to environmental engineering aspects of                        
              water management.  The Board's objective is to improve the                     
              scientific and technological basis for resolving important                     
              questions and issues relating to water and wastewater                          
              aspects of environmental engineering practice.  An                             
              important function of the Board is to sponsor workshops                        
              and conferences that are utilized for program planning                         
              purposes.  The Board also functions as an appropriate                          
              means for coordination of research plans with other                            
              Federal agencies including FEMA, USGS, EPA, DOE, and the                       
              U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
