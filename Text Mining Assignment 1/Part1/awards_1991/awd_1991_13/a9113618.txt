Abstract    :
              This is an experimental investigation of photonic band structure               
              and its effects on localization of light in disordered optical                 
              superlattices.  Photonic band structure will be measured in the                
              visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum in colloidal crystals.            
              In crystals with high refractive index contrast, photon                        
              localization will be pursued by introduction of appropriate                    
              disorder.  Picosecond time-of-flight, coherent backscattering, and             
              speckle spectroscopy will be among the probes used to examine                  
              photon transport in these materials.  The results of this research             
              will advance the understanding of localization and transport                   
              properties of classical waves in random media as well as electron              
              localization in disordered conductors.
