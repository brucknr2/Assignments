Abstract    :
                   The fourth Solar Cycle Workshop will be conducted at                      
              Sacramento Peak, New Mexico, during October 15-18, 1991.  The                  
              conference is concerned with various aspects of solar cycle                    
              variability including study of such pulsations in solar-like                   
              stars.  This is a subject of major interest to the STR program,                
              since it could lead to better understanding of the historical                  
              variability in our sun, including estimated of frequency of such               
              events as the Maunder and Sporer minima.  Funds are requested for              
              invited participants and students.
