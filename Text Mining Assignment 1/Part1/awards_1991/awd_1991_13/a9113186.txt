Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa                
              purchase laser equipment.  This equipment will be used in the                  
              following research activities:                                                 
                                                                                             
              A)  All-Optical Triple Resonance Spectroscopy                                  
                                                                                             
              B)  State-Selected Photodissociation                                           
                                                                                             
              C)  Spectroscopic and Dynamical Studies of Molecular                           
                  Clusters in Ground and Excited States                                      
                                                                                             
              D)  Velocity Modulation Spectroscopy of Molecular Ions                         
                                                                                             
              Lasers emit a narrow beam of coherent, powerful and nearly                     
              monochromatic electromagnetic radiation.  This radiation is                    
              used in chemistry to study a broad range of subjects, from the                 
              dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids to photoelectron                        
              transfer processes, and from interfacial chemistry to                          
              picosecond pulse shaping.  Lasers are also in optics,                          
              communications, and engineering.
