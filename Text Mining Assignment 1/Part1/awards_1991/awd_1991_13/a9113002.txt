Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research may be nominally divided into two parts.  The            
              first area is concerned with the synthesis and study of layered                
              phosphonates.  The chemistry outlined is a mixture of synthetic                
              chemistry and solid-state NMR.  The second area is concerned with              
              synthesis and study of layered systems for light induced charge                
              separation or electron transfer.  The proposed studies have                    
              important relevance in many fields of science and engineering.
