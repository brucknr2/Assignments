Abstract    :
              This Science in Developing Countries award will support a                      
              regional research workshop on Science and the State, to be held                
              in Mexico City in January 1992 in conjunction with the Third                   
              Congress of the Latin American Society for the History of                      
              Science and Technology.  Organizers are Joan Bromberg and James                
              Griesemer of the University of California at Davis and Juan                    
              Saldaa, an organizer of the Third Congress in Mexico.  The                    
              workshop aims to examine the relationship between the scientific               
              community in the Americas and the State, their differences, and                
              strategies that could be adopted for a more effective perfor-                  
              mance.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Nine U.S. panelists will present the results of recent research                
              on the relationship between U.S. Federal and state governments                 
              and science and technology, from the country's beginning until                 
              the present.  Nine Latin American historians will compare the                  
              U.S. experience with that of their nations.  The workshop will                 
              formulate problems for further historical research and lessons                 
              for today's science policy.  The benefits to both U.S. and                     
              Latin American participants are the development of new areas for               
              regional research cooperation and the potential for improving                  
              the nations' scientific infrastructures.
