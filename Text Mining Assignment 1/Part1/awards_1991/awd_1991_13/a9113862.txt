Abstract    :
                   Diamond films and diamond-like films have in recent years                 
              been processed in a variety of ways, from complex low pressure                 
              chemical vapor deposition chambers to rather more direct thermal               
              plasma techniques.  The latter, while apparently simpler in                    
              principle, is, in fact, not readily understood nor optimized.  It              
              is important to note that the diamond films in question have                   
              attributes which make them exceptionally attractive for                        
              applications ranging from hard tool surfaces to microelectronics.              
              The University and an industrial partner will cooperate to                     
              develop processing programs using advanced thermal plasma spray                
              technology to form such diamond films having industrial utility.               
                   The project will produce a unique thermal plasma system,                  
              operating at a relatively low power level (20 KW and below) and                
              processing methane and hydrogen gases.
