Abstract    :
              This award, which is jointly sponsored by the National Science                 
              Foundation and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will support a                 
              cooperative research project between Dr. Tseng-Yin Tien,                       
              Department of Materials Science and Engineering of the University              
              of Michigan at Ann Arbor and Dr. Yan Dongsheng, Division of                    
              Chemistry at the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics.  Silicon nitride              
              ceramics is one of the most promising materials for structural                 
              applications.  However, it can not be densified without the use                
              of sintering additives.  The research will include phase                       
              equilibrium studies in silicon nitride-metal oxide systems and                 
              mechanical property measurements of selected specimens.  Samples               
              will be prepared and then analyzed using X-ray diffraction and an              
              electron microscope.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Results of the research will lead to a greater understanding                   
              between composition, microstructure and mechanical properties of               
              silicon nitride ceramics.  This research will further result in                
              the development of silicon nitride ceramics with optimum                       
              mechanical properties.  The Shanghai Institute of Ceramics and                 
              Professor Yan are world famous experts on phase diagrams.                      
              Professor Tien and his Michigan group are the pre-eminent                      
              researchers in this area in the United States.  This                           
              collaboration should produce important scientific as well as                   
              technical results.  It is likely that these researchers will                   
              continue their research exchanges even after this award has                    
              terminated.
