Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Kollman will develop a new                   
              approach to the construction of intermolecular potentials for                  
              use in molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulation of                
              biomolecules.  He will focus on two issues: first, the addition                
              of non-additive non-bonded energy terms to the standard                        
              intermolecular potential which will have an important impact on                
              the ability to simulate structures and energies realistically                  
              for the widest range of molecules and, secondly, a general                     
              analysis of the functional forms and parameters in such                        
              potentials.  The non-additive effects will be built into the                   
              potential by explicitly incorporating polarization effects into                
              the force field.  Professor Kollman has developed a new model                  
              which can represent liquid water better than other non-additive                
              models and leads to an excellent reproduction of the properties                
              of dilute ionic solutions.  He will extend this model to other                 
              simple solvents and solutes in order to validate it as a                       
              general method for studying molecular liquids and solutions by                 
              computer based approaches.  The model will be tested against                   
              solutions of simple ions, salts, and small organic molecules as                
              well as organic macrocycles/ionophores.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The ability to simulate the interactions of biomolecules by                    
              means of molecular mechanics and dynamics will lead to a better                
              understanding of elementary biological processes in such areas                 
              as drug design and electron transport.  The intermolecular                     
              potentials developed by Professor Kollman are a key component                  
              of these simulations.
