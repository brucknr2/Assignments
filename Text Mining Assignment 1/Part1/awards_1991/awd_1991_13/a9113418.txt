Abstract    :
                   There is general concern for the integrity of field                       
              measurements of reactive atmospheric species that exist                        
              simultaneously in both the gas and aerosol phase.  This work                   
              permits comparison of the amine nitrogen of concurrently acquired              
              atmospheric gas and aerosol samples using the mist chamber and                 
              denuder techniques.  The experimental design focusses on                       
              identifying potential gas/aerosol phase interactions which might               
              compromise determination of discrete phase distribution for                    
              reduced nitrogen compounds.  In a broader sense, the results of                
              this study should enhance our understanding of processes involved              
              in atmospheric multiphase sampling.  Preliminary measurements                  
              point to the possibility that reduced organic nitrogen may be                  
              important basic components of the atmosphere in regions not                    
              directly influenced by anthropogenic sources.
