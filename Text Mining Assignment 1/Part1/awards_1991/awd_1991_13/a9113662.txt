Abstract    :
              The physical basis for our understanding of the stellar                        
              evolutionary is ultimately measured in the success of computational            
              models of stellar structure.  The Principal Investigator (PI) has              
              devoted his career to computing models of stars that permit an                 
              understanding of how stars evolve in time from one position on the             
              "H R Diagram" to another.  In the last three years the PI has begun            
              to extend his expertise to the difficult problems of the evolution             
              of binary stars, the accretion of hydrogen-rich material onto white            
              dwarfs and its subsequent gravitational settling and mixing, time-             
              dependent computations of "slow" neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.              
              A substantial part of the PI's new work will include hydrodynamical            
              simulations of accretion and mixing.  He will continue a vigorous              
              collaboration with M. Fujimoto and his collaborators in Japan to               
              include multi-dimensional hydrodynamical physics into his model                
              interior computer codes.  It is anticipated that this marriage will            
              facilitate added theoretical expertise to both Japanese and U.S.               
              astronomy.
