Abstract    :
              This award from the Office of Special Projects, Chemistry will                 
              provide partial travel support for approximately seventeen U.S.                
              chemists attending the 33rd Congress of the International Union                
              of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).  This Congress is the                   
              next in a series of biennial general congresses sponsored by                   
              the Union.  In order to assure that the United States will be                  
              represented with quality and distinction, and that younger                     
              chemists will have an opportunity to participate, the U.S.                     
              National Committee for IUPAC will organize a travel program to                 
              provide partial travel support to selected U.S. chemists.                      
              Other support will come from the U.S. National Committee and                   
              from private sources.

              The National Academy of Sciences is the National Adhering                      
              Organization for the United States in the IUPAC and maintains                  
              an active role in the affairs of the Union through the U.S.                    
              National Committee.  Travel awards will be highly leveraged                    
              with funds from non-governmental sources.  Awardees will submit                
              a brief report on the quality of the scientific program and the                
              benefits derived from attending the Congress.
