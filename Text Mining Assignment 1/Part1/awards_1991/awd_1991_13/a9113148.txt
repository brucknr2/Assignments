Abstract    :
              Biological visual systems perform many demanding tasks which are               
              far beyond the present capabilities of electronic hardware.  The               
              success of many biological systems can often be attributed to a                
              large degree of preprocessing at the peripheral sensory levels.                
              Mathematical statements of relevant preprocessing include                      
              multiplicative nonlinear lateral inhibition, center-surround                   
              receptive fields and Gabor function receptive fields.  The                     
              objectives of this project are to design and implement in digital              
              simulations such biologically motivated receptive fields, for                  
              automated visual preprocessing.  The design will be suitable for               
              future implementation in analog parallel integrated circuitry.                 
              The capability of priming the visual preprocessor to concentrate               
              on certain features via Adaptive Resonance Theory will be                      
              investigated.  These preprocessing schemes will be tested on an                
              industrially relevant task:  in process inspection of laminated                
              composites.//
