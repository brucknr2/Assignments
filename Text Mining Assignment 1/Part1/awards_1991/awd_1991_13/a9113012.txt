Abstract    :
                  A three year program of very low frequency (VLF) observations              
              at multiple sites across United States is proposed for the                     
              purpose of 'imaging' ionospheric disturbances that occur in                    
              association with lightning discharges.  The first year experiment              
              involves measurement of amplitude and phase of VLF transmitter                 
              signals at Puerto Rico, Huntsville, College Park, Houston and                  
              Stanford, providing a grid of great circle paths over the                      
              continent.  The location of transient ionospheric disturbancesare              
              determined by means of simultaneous occurrences on crossing and                
              collinear VLF paths.  The lightning-induced ionospheric                        
              disturbance events are recognized on the basis of their                        
              characteristic signatures and occur due to (i) lightning-induced               
              precipitation of energetic particles from the radiation belts,                 
              and (ii) direct upward coupling of lightning radiation to the                  
              lower ionosphere producing intense heating and ionization.  The                
              second year program involves measurements  at five closely spaced              
              sites in the vicinity of Huntsville, Alabama for the purpose of                
              tomographic imaging on a tight (but irregular) grid of paths.                  
              The proposed measurement program synergistically benefits from                 
              Stanford observations at Palmer, Antarctica and a recently                     
              developed three dimensional model of VLF propagation in the                    
              earth-ionospherewaveguide.  The third year observation program                 
              emphasizes measurement of event occurence in the south western                 
              and south-cenbtral United States region of known high                          
              thunderstorm activity.
