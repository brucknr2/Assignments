Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During fiscal year 1988, 3.75 million families received AFDC                   
              payments (Aid to Families with Dependent Children).  There were                
              10.9 million total recipients, two thirds of whom were children.               
              The total cash payments were approximately $17 billion.  The total             
              costs of administering the AFDC program were $2.29 billion, or                 
              around 13 percent of total cash payments.                                      
                                                                                             
              On a per recipient basis, there was substantial variation across               
              the states in the cost of administering the AFDC program.  In 1988,            
              for example, per recipient administrative costs ranged from lows               
              of $53.64 and $85.92 in Mississippi and West Virginia,                         
              respectively, to highs of $389.16 and 412.08 per year in Idaho and             
              Massachusetts, respectively.  The impact of administrative                     
              procedures on AFDC programs has received limited attention from                
              economists, despite the lack of uniformity in benefits level,                  
              eligibility standards, and the like among states.  Add to these                
              limitations of the AFDC programs the important issue of fraud                  
              control.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This study will undergo the following four projects: (1) a                     
              theoretical model of the decision to apply for welfare which                   
              incorporates both errors of stringency and errors of leniency; (2)             
              a game-theoretical model of the fraud control process which focuses            
              on the likelihood of "out-of-court" settlement (repayment) versus              
              prosecution; (3) a state-level time-series cross-section study of              
              the effects of administrative procedures, including fraud control,             
              on the AFDC program; and (4) an aggregate nested logit model of the            
              fraud control process itself.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This research will help explain to welfare policy-makers what                  
              factors influence the level of fraud and what might be done to                 
              better control the level of fraud.  The empirical work will also               
              offer an estimate of the extent to which fraud control activities              
              influence welfare caseload and expenditures.
