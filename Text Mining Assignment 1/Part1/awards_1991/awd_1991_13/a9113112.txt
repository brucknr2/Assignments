Abstract    :
              Partial support of a conference on high temperature chemistry which            
              will, for the first time officially recognize the important role of            
              solid state chemistry in the conference title.  The purpose is to              
              provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of scientific              
              results emerging from rapidly developing fields that include                   
              diamond and diamond-like materials, high-Tc superconductors,                   
              complex unit cell materials, and band theory calculations.  Sixty-             
              four presentations from individuals working in the top solid state             
              chemistry laboratories in the U.S. have registered for the meeting,            
              and thirty-three of the presenters will be graduate students and               
              post-doctoral students.
