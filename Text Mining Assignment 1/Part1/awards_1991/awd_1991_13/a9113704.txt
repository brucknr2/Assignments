Abstract    :
                   Current research has established the validity of the                      
              approach to automated fixture design whereby knowledge for a                   
              single operation is represented in an expert system.  The                      
              objective of the research is to extend the knowledge to incorporate            
              a more realistic scenario, namely, fixturing for a                             
              sequence of operations. The internship is based on established work            
              by the principal investigator in automated design of fixtures                  
              (AutoFix).  It plans to redesign the system to carry out fixturing             
              for a finite sequence of operations.  The work will commence with              
              knowledge acquisition from practitioners in industry.  A system                
              structure to handle multiple-optioned sets of heuristics (strategy,            
              meta, and knowledge rules) will be developed.  Knowledge on design             
              of fixtures for multiple operations will be represented in a                   
              rule/frame structure.  An existing computer-aided design (CAD)                 
              system interface will be incorporated.                                         
                   In automated design, this work will present a method of                   
              representing and handling complex design knowledge.  This method               
              may then be extended to other systems for mechanical design.  The              
              contribution to manufacturing research is more significant as                  
              this will greatly reduce fixture design and machine set-up times.              
              It will lay the foundation for future research in this field of                
              fixturing for a flexible manufacturing environment.
