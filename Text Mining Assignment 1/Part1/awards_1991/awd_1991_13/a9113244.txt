Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for incorporating quantum                                   
              wire nanostructures into gallium aluminum                                      
              arsenide multiple quantum well (MQW) optical                                   
              waveguide structures in order to enhance                                       
              nonlinear optical interactions.  The primary                                   
              technique to be pursued for fabrication of                                     
              quantum wires is to use focused ion beam (FIB)                                 
              direct writing onto MQW optical waveguides                                     
              followed by rapid thermal annealing to induce                                  
              impurity-induced layer or compositional                                        
              disordering (mixing).  Use of this FIB mixing                                  
              technique to define and form channel optical                                   
              waveguides is also planned.  In addition to using                              
              FIB mixing, electric field-induced periodic                                    
              surface confinement in multiple quantum well                                   
              regions to form quantum wires will also be                                     
              investigated.                                                                  
              Quantum wires are expected to provide a                                        
              stronger nonlinear response while the presence                                 
              of the optical waveguide provides high optical                                 
              power densities with low input power over long                                 
              propagation lengths.  These combined effects                                   
              may make the nonlinear interactions more                                       
              efficient at lower power levels and thus suitable                              
              for applications.                                                              
              Extensive experimental characterization will be                                
              performed on GaAlAs MQW samples, including                                     
              scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy                                 
              (STM, AFM), photon scanning tunneling

              (xTEM), spatially resolved photoluminescence                                   
              and Raman spectroscopies, and four-wave                                        
              mixing and pump-probe experiments on the                                       
              picosecond time scale.
