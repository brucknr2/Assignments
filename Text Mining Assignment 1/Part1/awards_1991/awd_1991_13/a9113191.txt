Abstract    :
              Dr. Flagan has proposed to investigate the synthesis of high                   
              quality ceramic powders using two approaches:  vapor precursor                 
              routes in which seed particle are grown by a combination of                    
              vapor and cluster deposition, and electrospray to produce fine                 
              droplets of liquid precursors.  The experimental and modeling                  
              research will focus on the densification of agglomerate                        
              particles, particle growth by cluster deposition, and scale-up                 
              techniques of seeded aerosol reactors and electrosprays.                       
                                                                                             
              Aerosol formation by vapor deposition and electrospray,                        
              sintering of agglomerate, and corresponding scale-up                           
              techniques are critical issues for the production of ceramic                   
              powders with engineered structures and properties.
