Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. William H. Dantzler,                
              Department of Physiology, University of Arizona, to pursue with                
              Dr. Varanuj Chatsudthipong, Department of Physiology, Mahidol                  
              University, Thailand, for a period of 24 months, research on the               
              renal tubular transport of organic anions.  The studies will                   
              involve a continuation and expansion of work on organic anion                  
              transport steps at both the basolateral and luminal membranes of               
              mammalian renal tubules.  They will utilize isolated perfused and              
              nonperfused renal tubules in vitro to test, in intact tubules,                 
              the model, based on data from membrane vesicles, that organic                  
              anions are transported into cells against an electrochemical                   
              gradient.  They will utilize similar techniques to evaluate                    
              p-aminohippurate transport across the luminal membrane in intact               
              tubules and evaluate possible anion exchange and the involvement               
              of inorganic ions in this transport process.                                   
                                                                                             
              These studies are important in gaining an understanding of how                 
              kidneys function and in making a comparison of kidney function in              
              reptiles and in mammals.  This project adds an international                   
              cooperative dimension to the PI's research under NSF Grant No.                 
              DCB-9001985.  The collaborators are highly respected scientists                
              who have a record of successful prior cooperative research.  This              
              project is relevant to the objectives of the Science in                        
              Developing Countries Program which seeks to increase the                       
              level of cooperation between U.S. and developing country                       
              scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific                    
              information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through                         
              collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.
