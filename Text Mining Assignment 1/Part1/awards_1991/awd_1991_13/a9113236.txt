Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed work is to develop, test and                     
              demonstrate a new generation of numerical methods to solve the                 
                                                                                             
              pdf equations for turbulent combustion.                                        
                                                                                             
              In several major industries, there is an increasing use of                     
              turbulent combustion models to aid the design and development                  
              of combustion devices.  The usefulness of these methods has                    
              already been established, but it can be significantly enhanced                 
                                                                                             
              through improvements in the modelling and computational                        
              implementation.  PDF methods provide the needed capability to                  
              handle finite-rate kinetic effects, such as the formation of                   
              NOx and the burning of CO.  However, the focus is not on                       
              modelling issues, but on the computational implementation of                   
              pdf methods.  Industry requires methods that are much more                     
              accurate, robust and economical than those currently                           
              available.  A radically new Monte Carlo method will be                         
              developed to solve the pdf equations.  It will be second-order                 
                                                                                             
              accurate in space and time; it will include a PISO-type mean                   
              pressure algorithm applicable both to low-speed and high-speed                 
                                                                                             
              flow; it will incorporate advanced variance-reduction                          
              techniques (to reduce statistical errors); and, it will be                     
              structured for implementation on vector and parallel                           
              architectures.
