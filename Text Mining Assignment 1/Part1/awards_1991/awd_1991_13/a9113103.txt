Abstract    :
              This dissertation focuses on Canadian government programs of                   
              resettlement of Inuit (Eskimo) communities: from Port Harrison to              
              Resolute Bay and Grise Fiord (1953-55), Ennadai Lake to North Henik            
              Lake (1957-58), Nutak and Hebron to southern Labrador (1956-59),               
              and Killiniq to northern Quebec (1978).  Field and archival                    
              research will focus on government use of resettlement for                      
              sustainable development, impacts on health, economic welfare,                  
              intergroup relations and social change. The goal is to gain an                 
              understanding of the political processes involved at the time and              
              the long-term social and economic effects of relocation on native              
              populations in the Arctic.
