Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the U.S. Arabidopsis Biological Resource                   
              Center located at Ohio State University.  The center will                      
              collect, maintain, and distribute Arabidopsis seeds and other                  
              biological resources such as RFLP markers and YAC libraries.  An               
              advisory committee consisting of active Arabidopsis researchers                
              will advise the center on its policy and overall operation.  The               
              Center also provides information associated with the resources it              
              maintains, including genetic data, biological history, and                     
              bibliography.  The research community will have access to this                 
              information either electronically or via regularly published                   
              catalogues.  Necessary databases and software for this purpose is              
              being developed in collaboration with a computer scientist at                  
              Michigan State University under a companion NSF grant, DIR 91-                 
              21030.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The Arabidopsis research community had identified the                          
              establishment of resource centers as high priority for the                     
              multinational coordinated Arabidopsis genome research project,                 
              and recommended that at least two such centers be established                  
              world-wide.  There are currently two Arabidopsis resource centers              
              in Europe; a seed center in U.K. and a clone center in Germany.                
              The U.S. center will collaborate with the European centers so                  
              that together, they can efficiently meet the needs of the world                
              Arabidopsis research community.
