Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation                
              to study the properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, and                   
              sea-ice on a transect between Murmansk, USSR and Nome, Alaska.                 
              There are few published measurements of biomass or production                  
              from most shelf and basin regions of the Arctic Ocean.  This                   
              project is one of four that will evaluate biological processes in              
              the Arctic Ocean during the Trans-Arctic cruise of the SOVETSKIY               
              SOYUZ.  It will investigate role of bacteria in the cycling of                 
              organic matter in the Arctic Ocean. The program will study the                 
              spatial variation in bacterial biomass and production and their                
              significance in organic matter cycling and the sinking flux out                
              of the region of light penetration and into deeper depths.                     
              Concentrations of various organic fractions in sea water will                  
              also be accomplished.
