Abstract    :
              A primary factor limiting the accuracy of shipboard                            
              Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements is                       
              uncertainty in the ship's heading as measured by the                           
              gyrocompass.  ADCP has become a powerful tool for measuring                    
              undersea currents from moving research vessels.  Using                         
              carrier phase measurements of the Global Positioning System                    
              satellites with an array of antennas, the ability to                           
              routinely measure ship's heading, pitch, and roll with an                      
              accuracy of order 0.1 degrees will be investigated.  The                       
              study will include analysis of algorithms and error                            
              sources, and the development of software for recording and                     
              postprocessing the carrier phase measurements to yield the                     
              attitude of the antenna array. The prototype system will be                    
              tested at sea on short cruises, and will be used to improve                    
              ADCP accuracy on the first three WOCE Hydrographic Project                     
              cruises in the Pacific.
