Abstract    :
                   The objective of this internship project is to develop and                
              apply automated process planning and production planning systems               
              within an electronics manufacturing environment.  The particular               
              process to be analyzed will be printed circuit board assembly                  
              including specification of machine operating sequences and                     
              generation of machine instructions to execute the operation                    
              sequence.                                                                      
                   It is expected that the results of this work will be                      
              relevant to electronics manufacturing in general.  The project                 
              will also serve as a catalyst for the development of a state-of-               
              the-art research and teaching laboratory for electronics                       
              manufacturing system analysis and a senior level                               
              multi-disciplinary course in this area.
