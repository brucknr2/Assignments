Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) is establishing a                       
              connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line through                 
              the WISCNET state network.  The connection enhances                            
              collaborations of campus scientists with colleagues at other                   
              institutions in the fields of physics, image processing,                       
              biomedical simulation, and mechanical engineering, and allows                  
              access to libraries and other remote facilities throughout the                 
              internet.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              In addition, some of the faculty are working toward their Ph.Ds,              
              and a network connection enables them to continue their research               
              without having to relocate.  This award funds part of the costs                
              for two years.***//
