Abstract    :
              This project will use workstation-quality computer graphics to aid             
              in the visualization of concepts in the undergraduate chemistry                
              curriculum.  It focuses on visual presentations and real-time                  
              visual manipulations.  Examples of subjects include atomic and                 
              molecular orbitals, molecular geometry, organic dynamics and                   
              structure, docking of drug molecules, proteins, and other                      
              biological macromolecules, polymer structure and stereochemistry,              
              and crystal structures and Miller index planes.  Certain concepts              
              and visualization programs will be developed for (or adapted for               
              use on) personal computers coupled with videotapes, laser                      
              videodiscs, and other media so that the images can be used in                  
              chemistry lectures, in student tutorials, and for open-ended                   
              inquiry.  The project aims to have broad impact on and utility for             
              undergraduate chemistry curricula nationally.  This project was                
              funded equally by the Division of Undergraduate Science,                       
              Engineering, and Mathematics Education, and the Division of                    
              Chemistry.
