Abstract    :
                   For optical inspection of automotive components, research                 
              has been developed for computing the minimum number of re-                     
              orientations of the workpiece so as to allow for total exposure.               
              This work has been called set-up minimization.  The objective of               
              this internship is to transfer this technology to the automotive               
              industry by developing a procedure that maintains the number of                
              setups constant thereby avoiding the high cost of calibration and              
              the danger of error propagation.                                               
                   Two problems are formulated: Inspection with a single set-up              
              and inspection with no set-up.  For each, the difficulties,                    
              solution approaches and tasks are detailed.  The solution to                   
              these problems is expected to significantly enhance throughput                 
              for quality control operations in the automotive industry.
