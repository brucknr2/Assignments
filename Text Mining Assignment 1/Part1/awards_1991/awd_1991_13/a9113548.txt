              The Tenth Dissertations Symposium on Chemical Oceanography                     
              (DISCO) will be held November 18-23, 1991 at the East-West                     
              Center, University of Hawaii campus, Honolulu, Hawaii.  Twenty-                
              six chemical oceanography candidates will meet for five days in                
              formal and informal sessions to present their theses                           
              dissertations, contribute to discussions, participate in                       
              working groups, and meet with other attendees and sponsors to                  
              discuss their work and future activities.  The sponsors will                   
              delineate the federal government programs in chemical                          
              oceanography and present avenues of support.  The proceedings                  
              will be published.  This will be the tenth in a series of                      
              symposia supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF),                   
              Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the National Oceanic and                   
              Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
