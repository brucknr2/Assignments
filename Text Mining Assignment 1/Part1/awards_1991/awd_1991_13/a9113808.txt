Abstract    :
              Two broad topics will be investigated - the synthesis of highly                
              reduced carbene complexes of transition metals in negative                     
              oxidation states, and pericyclic reactions of reductively                      
              activated aromatic ligands.  The principal objective of the                    
              studies is to answer three broad questions: 1) What range of                   
              pi-acceptor ligands is capable of stabilizing complexes of                     
              metals in negative oxidation states?, 2) How wide is the range                 
              of accessible complexes for those classes of ligands which do                  
              prove to be capable of stabilizing negative oxidation states?,                 
              and 3) Will pi-back-donation of electron density from highly                   
              reduced metal centers to the (typically unsaturated)                           
              pi-acceptor ligands activate the ligands towards electrophiles,                
              coupling reactions, or other unprecedented reactivity modes?                   
              An important secondary objective is the development of new                     
              reactions with potential applications in organic synthesis.

              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                    
              metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. N. John Cooper                 
              of the University of Pittsburgh will synthesize and study the                  
              reactivity of complexes containing transition metals in                        
              negative oxidation states.  These very unusual and highly                      
              reactive compounds may have applications in organic synthesis.
