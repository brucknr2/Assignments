Abstract    :
                   This project will study the lubricating effect of a thin layer            
              of aluminum on the surface of a ceramic cutting tool when it is                
              used in the machining of superalloys.  The investigators have                  
              noticed that a strongly adherent layer of aluminum deposits on the             
              face of an alumina-zirconia cutting tool when aluminum is machined.            
              The project will determine whether such a layer may provide                    
              effective reduction in the wear of the tool in the machining of                
              difficult to machine alloys, such as hardened steels and                       
              superalloys.  If the layer does provide such lubricating action,               
              some investigations may be attempted to develop practical methods              
              for utilizing and optimizing the effect under practical machining              
              conditions.                                                                    
                   The machining of superalloys and hardened steels is a                     
              significant industrial problem, providing a major cost in the                  
              production of aircraft engines, in particular.
