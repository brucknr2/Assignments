Abstract    :
                   St. Louis University requests support from NSF for                        
              connection of its campus network to NSFNET.  MIDNET is the                     
              midlevel network located in the state of Missouri that will                    
              provide operations and network information services.  It will                  
              give St. Louis University a 56 thousand bits per second                        
              connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per              
              second) National Backbone network.                                             
                   The College needs greater functionality and network speed to              
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
