Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to:                                            
                                                                                            
              Apply and adapt Petri net theory for solutions to pragmatic problems           
              in concurrent-software analysis.  Specific topics to be investigated           
              include continued research on using Petri net techniques and tools for         
              Ada tasking analysis and for logic specification evaluation.  A number         
              of techniques and problems will be considered including the                    
              implementation of Petri net invariant techniques and study of the              
              relationship of this technique to the constrained expressions method.
