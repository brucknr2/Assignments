Abstract    :
                   A completely relativistic theory of strong-field atomic                   
              photoionization will be developed utilizing the approximation                  
              that the photoelectron's potential energy in the strong field                  
              is larger than its binding energy.  The theoretical                            
              development will be used to explore tunneling phenomena and to                 
              develop a full theory of the "stabilization" phenomenon in                     
              high field photoionization.
