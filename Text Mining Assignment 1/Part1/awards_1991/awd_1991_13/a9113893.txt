Abstract    :
              This project is part of an integrated scientific                               
              investigation to study the properties of the Arctic ocean,                     
              atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast Water (NEW)                   
              Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order                    
              to gain an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope                      
              processes.  This element of the NEW program will evaluate                      
              the magnitude and temporal variability of biologically                         
              produced large particulate organic material, its flux to the                   
              benthos, and its fate using a variety of complimentary                         
              experimental techniques.
