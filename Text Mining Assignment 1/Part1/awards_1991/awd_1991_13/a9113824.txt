Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a workshop on Biodiversity, to be held at              
              the Harvard Forest, Petersham, Massachusetts on June 27 to July                
              1, 1991.  The workshop has two principal objectives:                           
                                                                                             
              1)  To prepare a set of testable hypotheses relating biodiversity              
              at each of the biological levels (molecular, genetic,                          
              population, species, community and ecosystem levels) to the                    
              other levels of complexity.  A 50-page paper by the PI will serve              
              as the basis of discussion.                                                    
                                                                                             
              2)  To develop a set of criteria for a proposed international                  
              network for the inventory and monitoring of biodiversity, and to               
              outline the elements of such a network.                                        
                                                                                             
              The products of the workshop will comprise a document that will                
              be forwarded to the International Conference on Biodiversity that              
              will take place in the USSR in October 1991, for discussion and                
              approval by that body.
