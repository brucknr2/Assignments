Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves a cultural anthropologist studying European              
              members of parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg as they debate                
              and develop a new political philosophy combining "Green",                      
              regional, and ethnic-based constituencies and federal                          
              opportunities and constraints.  Using in-depth interviews and                  
              observation of political meetings the investigator will assess                 
              the importance of these social and political values as they are                
              enacted in the evolving political landscape of Western Europe.                 
                                                                                             
              This research is important because Europe is developing in ways                
              that will dramatically change the modern political world system.               
              Increased understanding by U.S. scholars of the social and                     
              cultural dynamics underlying these changes, which this sort of                 
              in-depth study provides, will help policy makers deal with the                 
              new world system.
