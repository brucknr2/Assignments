Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic                      
              environment and its role in global change which is promoted                    
              by NSF's Arctic System Science Program.  It is a three year                    
              project to understand the dynamics of the thermohaline                         
              circulation associated with surface salinity fluxes by                         
              applying a numerical model in a sequence of process-oriented                   
              studies.  Surface cooling and brine rejection during ice                       
              formation lead to large surface salinity fluxes in many                        
              areas of the Arctic Ocean, particularly over the continental                   
              shelves.  This negative buoyancy input increases the water                     
              density to such an extent that it may sink to the bottom and                   
              induce thermohaline circulation patterns with may generate                     
              dense-water bottom currents in the form of plumes.  Such                       
              dense-water plumes may transport shelf water across the                        
              shelf and deposit it into the deep Arctic basins, thus                         
              contributing to the large-scale Arctic circulation.
