Abstract    :
                   Professor Feldman will continue his research in ergodic                   
              theory giving particular attention to the following areas: (i)                 
              normal distributions with respect to p,q multiplication, (ii)                  
              continuous products of probability spaces, (iii) ergodic theory                
              for actions of amenable (non-unimodular) groups, (iv) smooth                   
              ergodic theory, and (v) subrelations of ergodic equivalence                    
              relations.                                                                     
                   Research in ergodic theory involves trying to understand the              
              average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or               
              chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading               
              "dynamics" can be placed the modern theory of how groups of                    
              abstract transformations act on smooth spaces.  Another important              
              theme in ergodic theory is the classification of systems into                  
              broad categories which are mathematically identical in an                      
              abstract sense.  Professor Feldman's research will make contact                
              with these areas.
