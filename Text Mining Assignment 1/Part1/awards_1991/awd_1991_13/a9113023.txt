Abstract    :
                   The Second School on Non-Accelerator Particle                             
              Astrophysics will be held at the International Centre for                      
              Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste, Italy from June 3-14,                     
              1991.  The School is directed by J. Stone, Boston University,                  
              USA., G. Giacomelli, University of Bologna, Italy, and E.                      
              Bellotti, University of Milano and Laboratorio Nazionale del                   
              Gran Sasso, Italy.  The principle purpose of the school is to                  
              provide lectures on a number of theoretical and experimental                   
              topics in non-accelerator particle astrophysics as an                          
              educational forum for graduate students and young postdoctoral                 
              fellows pursuing research careers in this field.  The School                   
              is partially sponsored by ICTP through UNESCO which supports                   
              the participation of students from developing nations and the                  
              Istituto Nazionale Fisica Nucleare (INFN) which supports the                   
              participation of Italian scientists.  Funds from this project                  
              will support the participation of American graduate students                   
              and postdocs.  An independent review panel of three persons                    
              with knowledge of the field will be assembled to select School                 
              applicants from the United States to be granted project funds                  
              to support their travel and subsistence expenses.  Selection                   
              criteria will be based on the applicant's personal statement,                  
              letters of recommendation, and academic record and/or research                 
              publications.
