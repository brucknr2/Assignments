Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project supports an anthropology                    
              student from the University of Michigan studying changes in                    
              marriage patterns in two tribal communities in eastern Indonesia.              
              The project will examine the effects of cash crop production (in               
              one group) on traditional marriage exchanges and responsibilities              
              within and between family groups.  One group has substituted cash              
              exchanges for traditional goods, and the project hypothesizes                  
              that these cash exchanges are associated with increasing social                
              stratification.  Methods include local surveys, participant                    
              observation, and structured interviewing.                                      
                                                                                             
              This research is important because tribal groups all over the                  
              world are becoming increasingly monetized.  Understanding how the              
              commercial aspects of their lives changes traditional social                   
              relations will help policy makers deal with these usually                      
              negative aspects of economic development.
