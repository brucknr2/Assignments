Abstract    :
                   This program is based on the use of alkali atoms excited by               
              lasers to specific high-lying (Rydberg) states, to several                     
              classes of problems:                                                           
                   1) The study of the velocity dependence of Rydberg atom                   
              collision processes;                                                           
                   2) the study of electron-molecule interactions at very low                
              electron energies;                                                             
                   3) the characterization of properties of Rydberg atoms in                 
              specific states with very large principal quantum numbers (100 <               
              n< 500); and                                                                   
                   4) to study the response of Rydberg atoms to perturbations                
              by the fields existing at a solid surface (<1Mev).                             
                   These investigations involve innovative laser and optical                 
              techniques to achieve well defined populations of Rydberg atoms,               
              and it explores innovative approaches to these several problems                
              which may lead to important physical understanding not otherwise               
              available.
