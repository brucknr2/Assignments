Abstract    :
              The Rosensteil School at the University of Miami will                          
              continue operation of a satellite communications facility                      
              for scientific research purposes.  Through a cooperative                       
              agreement between NASA and the University of Miami,                            
              operational control and scheduling of NASA's ATS-3                             
              satellite has been turned over to the University.  Limited                     
              use of the LES 9/8 DoD communications satellites has also                      
              been obtained.  A modest communications facility has been                      
              established by the University in Malabar, Florida to                           
              facilitate usage of these satellites for NSF-sponsored                         
              research activities.  The ocean sciences and Antarctic                         
              research communities have regularly scheduled access to the                    
              satellites for voice and data communications in support of                     
              remote research investigations.  The ongoing work to be                        
              accomplished includes: 1) continued coordination of                            
              oceanographic and Antarctic ATS usage; 2) the study and                        
              implementation of other communications paths (utilizing LES                    
              9/8 and INMARSAT systems) between high seas and Antarctic                      
              users and the continental U.S.; 3) providing the capability                    
              for direct satellite mediated data network access via                          
              DECnet, TCP/IP and other methods.  The communications                          
              services provided by this facility are important to the                        
              successful completion of many research projects at sea and                     
              in Antarctica.
