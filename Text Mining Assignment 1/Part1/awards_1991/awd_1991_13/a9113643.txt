Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to permit Dr. Kongki Min,                            
              Department of Physics, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,                       
              to pursue with Dr. Jong Chan Kim, Department of Physics,                       
              Seoul National University, for 24 months, a program of                         
              cooperative research in medium energy physics.  These                          
              scientists and members of their research groups will                           
              collaborate in a study of photopion reactions in light                         
              nuclei, using quasi-monoenergetic photons (gamma rays).                        
              Two experiments will be undertaken.  The first is                              
              directed toward understanding the spin-isospin mode                            
              nuclear excitations in A=12 and A=13 systems and their                         
              similarities, while the second experiment will elucidate                       
              the reaction mechanism of the photopion production                             
              process, especially the effect of delta dynamics in                            
              nuclei.  These experiments will be conducted at the                            
              Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory, University of                             
              Saskatchewan, a unique research facility in Canada which                       
              has allocated nearly 700 hours of beam time for this                           
              research.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The proposed research should provide valuable                                  
              information on the structure of atomic nuclei and                              
              nuclear reaction mechanisms.  The U.S. and Korean                              
              collaborators are highly respected scientists with                             
              proven ability in this field.  They have collaborated                          
              successfully in related research under NSF Grant No.                           
              INT-8819820.  The present project will add an                                  
              international cooperative dimension to Dr. Min's                               
              research under NSF Grant No. PHY-8905162 and will allow                        
              the collaborators to combine their talents and interests                       
              for mutual benefit.  This project is relevant to the                           
              objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program                       
              which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between                       
              U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the                           
              exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                         
              techniques and through collaboration on problems of                            
              mutual benefit.  Korean participation in the project is                        
              supported by the Korea Science and Engineering                                 
              Foundation (KOSEF).
