Abstract    :
              Interaction between the earth's atmosphere and the ground is                   
              primarily confined to a  relatively thin atmospheric layer (about              
              1 km deep, the planetary boundary layer.  There are observations               
              available, primarily in the lowest few hundred meters of the                   
              atmosphere, that depict the distribution of wind, temperature and              
              humidity that accompany the passage of a front.  Fronts are often              
              accompanied by severe weather:  there is a need to diagnose the                
              physical processes that are associated with fronts, and to                     
              predict their movement and severity.  Yet there are few if any                 
              models, that can provide a fundamental conceptual framework upon               
              which to analyze low-level observations taken during frontal                   
              passages.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The proposed research is designed to develop a planetary boundary              
              layer model that may be used for the analysis of meteorological                
              variables that accompany the passage of an atmospheric front.                  
              Available data will be used to evaluate the relative importance                
              of different physical processes, and to reduce the model to a                  
              form that is amenable to analysis.                                             
                                                                                             
              Independent data are expected to be available from instrumented                
              meteorological tower measurements in the People's Republic of                  
              China, and from the U.S. National Weather Experiment (STORM)                   
              observational array in the mid-west (during the winter of 1992).               
              These data may be used to verify model predictions, and to refine              
              the model for use as a diagnostic tool in planetary boundary                   
              studies.  This work is particularly relevant to STORM related                  
              activities during the 1990's and to work presently being carried               
              out in the Severe Meso-Scale Laboratory of Nanjing University.
