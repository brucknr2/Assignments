Abstract    :
                This proposal aims to identify Leishmania parasite antigens                  
              recognized by T cells and to clone their genes and                             
              characterize their T cell antigenic determinants.                              
              Immunochemical, biochemical and molecular biology techniques                   
              will be used.                                                                  
                Two strains of Leishmania, Leishmania major LRC 137 (V121)                   
              and L. major LRC119, and the murine model BALB/c H-2K, CBA/H                   
              or C57BL/6 mice will be used.  The proposal is based on the                    
              observations that there are L. major antigens that are                         
              recognized by T helper cells.  The T helper cells function                     
              by producing effector molecules that primarily activate                        
              macrophages (L. major) and stimulate sensitized T cytotoxic                    
              cells to mount specific cell mediated response.                                
                Information generated from this basic research project will                  
              contribute to our general knowledge of cellular and                            
              molecular immunology by providing information on the                           
              mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation.  It will                    
              shed light on the chemical properties of T cell epitopes and                   
              allow us to understand how T cell epitopes are selected for                    
              processing and presentation and how they might interact with                   
              the T cell receptor (TCR alpha/beta) during antigen                            
              dependent activation of T helper cells.
