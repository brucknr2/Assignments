Abstract    :
              Quantum-mechanical tunneling research has had a profound impact                
              upon our understanding of traditional superconductors.  It has also            
              found substantial application.  We shall develop the processes                 
              necessary to fabricate reproducible tunnel junctions in the high-Tc            
              bismuth oxides and copper oxide.  We shall then use these junctions            
              to explore basic questions regarding the existence of an energy gap            
              in these materials and the mechanism responsible for the electron              
              pairing.  In addition, these processes can be used to fabricate                
              Josephson devices.
