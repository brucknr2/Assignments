Abstract    :
                   The PI plans to extend an existing wintertime database of                 
              physical and chemical properties of cloud droplet populations at               
              Storm Peak Laboratory Specifically, data will be collected far a               
              two week period during December - January of 1991 - 1992 and                   
              1992 - 1993, cloud droplet populations will be classified as                   
              maritime, continental, or "mixed" using concentration and                      
              diameter as criteria, back trajectories will be computed to                    
              determine the geographic location of SPL air parcels 48 hours                  
              prior to cloud sampling, and cloud water chemical analysis will                
              be used to distinguish between droplet populations primarily                   
              formed on marine sulfate, crustal sulfate, or pollution sulfate.               
              Additionally, complimentary aerosol measurements will be taken in              
              clear conditions, and a 1 - D adiabatic cloud model will be used               
              to determine a probable original CCN spectrum.  Trends in total                
              droplet concentration and mean diameter will also be determined                
              using existing data with data collected as part of the proposed                
              research.
