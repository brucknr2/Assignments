Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor William B. Jones of the                          
              University of Colorado and two of his graduate students to                     
              collaborate in mathematics research with Professors Olav                       
              Njastad, Haakon Waadeland and others of the University of                      
              Trondheim, Norway.  Professor Jones is devoting his                            
              sabbatical year to continuing his fruitful collaboration                       
              with Norwegian mathematicians.  During this period, two of                     
              his graduate students will visit Norway with support from                      
              this grant to work with the Norwegian group.  The subject                      
              of this U.S.-Norwegian collaboration in classical analysis                     
              is rational interpolation in the complex domain by Pade                        
              approximants and continued fractions.  The joint work will                     
              involve applications of this technique in moment theory,                       
              orthogonal polynomials and Gaussian quadrature.  The                           
              collaborators will also pursue mathematical research on                        
              digital signal processing, including the determination of                      
              hidden periodicities.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Pade approximants and their generalizations are employed in                    
              the theory and applications of many areas of mathematics.                      
              The development of high speed computers has stimulated                         
              applications in the physical and engineering sciences.  The                    
              substantial current interest and range of activity in this                     
              field will benefit from the results of this U.S.-Norway                        
              collaboration.
