Abstract    :
              The objective of this bilateral workshop on " The Mechanics of                 
              Ice and Its Applications," is to bring together strong common                  
              interests of the United States and the Soviet Union in obtaining               
              a better understanding of the behavior of ice at all scales. To                
              safely and economically exploit the vast resources in Alaska and               
              Siberia, it is required to have an in-depth understanding of the               
              movement of the ice cover, the forces the moving ice can exert                 
              against bottom founded structures, and the ice resistance on                   
              vessels used to transport these resources to the market. The                   
              proposed workshop will bring together top ice researchers and                  
              scientists from academia and industry to discus these key issues.
