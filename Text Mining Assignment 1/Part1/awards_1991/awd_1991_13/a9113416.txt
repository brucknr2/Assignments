Abstract    :
              This project supports the participation of Dr. F. C.                           
              Adetuyi of the Federal University of Technology,                               
              Nigeria, in an ongoing study led by Dr. Jon Y.                                 
              Takemoto of Utah State University, (NSF Grant                                  
              DCB-9003398), of the properties and chemical structure                         
              of the Syringae toxin.  This collaborative component                           
              will expand the work to investigate an antifungal                              
              toxin produced by Pseudomonas syringae isolated from                           
              wheat seed coats.  The toxin's structure will be                               
              determined and its mode of action on yeasts studied.                           
                                                                                             
              The cooperation could lead to methods for controlling                          
              fungal deterioration of stored cereal grains.  This                            
              has implications for the use of wheat seeds for                                
              genetic stock as well as for food uses.  The project                           
              is consistent with the criteria for the Science in                             
              Developing Countries (SDC) program in that it                                  
              strengthens collaboration between U.S. scientists and                          
              engineers and their counterparts in developing                                 
              countries, and increases the capacity of scientists                            
              and engineers in developing countries to address                               
              constraints to development.
