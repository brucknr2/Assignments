Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for a workshop to identify the                              
              research needs for coping with uncertainty in power                            
              systems.  Four areas of research are identified under                          
              this topic: uncertainty in future capacity needs,                              
              uncertainty in the regulatory environment, uncertainty                         
              in environmental effects, and uncertainty in power                             
              system modelling.  This workshop will also be                                  
              supported by the Edison Electric Institute.
