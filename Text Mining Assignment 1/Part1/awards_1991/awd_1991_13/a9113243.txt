Abstract    :
              It is proposed to make pump-probe picosecond measurements on                   
              molecular defects in crystalline, polymeric and glassy solids                  
              throughout the infrared region of the spectrum with an infrared-               
              tunable picosecond laser system.  The ability to tune to infrared              
              vibrational transitions will make possible the first systematic                
              investigation of energy transfer processes while the entire solid              
              remains in the electronic ground state.  Funds are requested for               
              the Cornell Far Infrared Laboratory to purchase a laser system                 
              which generates high intensity infrared pulses with wavelengths                
              tunable from 1.5 microns to 8 microns.  This system consists of a              
              high-energy mod-locked neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG)              
              laser, part of whose output is doubled in frequency and used to                
              pump a set of picosecond dye laser stages.  Infrared radiation is              
              then generated by mixing the dye laser output with the fundamental             
              of the Nd:YAG laser in a nonlinear crystal.
