Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support collaborative research between Philip                  
              Mulry, Colgate University and Gordon Plotkin, University of                    
              Edinburgh.  Utilizing certain algebraic tools, specifically monads,            
              algebras and categories, the investigators propose to develop a                
              systematic and conceptual approach to the interpretation and                   
              solution of questions in computation theory and programming                    
              language semantics.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Dr. Plotkin's group is especially strong in the areas of Dr. Mulry's           
              research.  They have identified three research topics of                       
              complementary interest and expertise: (1) partial data types; (2)              
              categorical fixed semantics; and (3) special models of computation             
              involving strong closure and properties, and intrinsic internal                
              structure. The U.S. investigator will benefit particularly from Dr.            
              Plotkin's diverse approaches to these problems and his pioneering              
              research on denotational and algebraic semantics of programs.  The             
              results of this collaboration are expected to advance understanding            
              of the fundamental structures of computer science and its                      
              theoretical foundation.
