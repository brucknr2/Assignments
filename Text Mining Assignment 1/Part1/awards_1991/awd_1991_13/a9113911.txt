Abstract    :
              Research will be undertaken on the quantum mechanics of strongly-              
              correlated many-body systems.  The objectives are to enhance our               
              understanding of novel phenomena which cannot be addressed by                  
              simple perturbation theory.  Systems of interest include the                   
              integer and fractional quantum Hall effect; transport in mesoscopic            
              devices; the interplay among disorder, interactions and                        
              superconductivity in one-dimensional systems; and, the problem of              
              fractional statistics.  An important question remaining in the                 
              integer quantum Hall effect concerns the nature of Anderson                    
              localization in the presence of disorder.  The focus of the                    
              investigation on the fractional Hall effect will be on the                     
              instability to Wigner crystallization in the low filling factor                
              regime and on the nature of edge-state excitations and their role              
              in the transport properties of mesoscopic devices.  A central theme            
              of the Hall effect work is the deep and wide-ranging implications              
              of the analyticity of the quantum wave functions in the lowest                 
              Landau level.  Previous work on the superconductor-insulator                   
              transition will be extended to one-dimension and certain exactly               
              soluble models will be investigated.  The notions of fractional                
              statistics will be put to practical application in the study of                
              quantum spin systems in two-dimensions.
