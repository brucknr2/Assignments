Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to advance the                               
              methodology for reliability analysis of interconnected                         
              power systems.  Several modeling extensions including                          
              jointly owned generation units, dependence among tie                           
              capacities, load uncertainty, and development of                               
              parallel algorithms will be investigated.
