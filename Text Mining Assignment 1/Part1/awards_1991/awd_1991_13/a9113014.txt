Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop a                                 
              methodology to analyze the effect of geomagnetically                           
              induced on the cores of high voltage transformers.                             
              Three dimensional finite element analysis will be used                         
              to develop such models.  Magnetic fields, stray flux                           
              patterns, and eddy currents within the core will be                            
              predicted using this methodology.
