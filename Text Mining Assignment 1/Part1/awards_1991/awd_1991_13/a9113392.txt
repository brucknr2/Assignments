Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports cooperative                                     
              research in operator K-theory and                                              
              representation of p-adic groups between Paul                                   
              Baum and Nigel Higson, Pennsylvania State                                      
              University, and Roger Plymen from the                                          
              University of Manchester in the United Kingdom.                                
              The objective of this project is to determine                                  
              the validity of the Baum-Connes conjecture                                     
              using the case of semi-simple, p-adic algebraic                                
              groups.  The investigators will also explore                                   
              the conjecture's relationship to index theory                                  
              for Euclidean buildings and to Kutsko's                                        
              conjecture for semi-simple, p-adic groups.                                     
                                                                                             
              The proposed research will advance our                                         
              understanding of the K-theory of C* algebras                                   
              associated with p-adic groups.  By bringing                                    
              together results from the number theory,                                       
              analysis, topology and group representation                                    
              theory, K-theory provides an adequate framework                                
              for expressing and unifying results in these                                   
              fields.  This project will benefit by combining                                
              Baum and Higson's geometric viewpoint and                                      
              experience on K-theory and index theory with                                   
              Plymen's work on representational theory and                                   
              algebraic (p-adic) groups.
