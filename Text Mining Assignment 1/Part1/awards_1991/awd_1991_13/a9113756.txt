Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to             
              study the properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice and              
              biology in the Northeast Water (NEW) Polynya, which occurs near                
              northeastern Greenland, in order to gain an integrated                         
              understanding of Arctic shelf-slope processes.  This element of                
              the NEW program will characterize the structure and function of                
              benthic communities inside and outside the polynya.  Grab and trawl            
              samples will be taken to test hypotheses that benthic biomass and              
              density are greater inside compared to outside the polynya.  The               
              role of benthic organisms in the flux or organic material between              
              pelagic and benthic systems and in the transfer of energy from the             
              benthos to higher trophic levels is central to this study.
