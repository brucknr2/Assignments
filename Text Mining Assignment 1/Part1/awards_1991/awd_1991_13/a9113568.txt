Abstract    :
                   Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests support from               
              NSF for connection of Assumption College, College of the Holy                  
              Cross, and Suffolk University to the New England Academic                      
              Research Network (NEARnet) which is the NSF mid-level network                  
              that serves the New England area.  A primary goal of NEARnet is                
              to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing of resources                  
              between instutuion, including those outside the state.                         
                   NEARnet will provide operations management and information                
              services and it will give the three universities a connection to               
              the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)                    
              National Backbone network.                                                     
                   The each of the universities has written a description of                 
              its orgainization and a statement of the benefits of Internet                  
              access that it expects including: greater functionality and                    
              network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and              
              make file transfers along with being able to implement a more                  
              reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit               
              from the links.  This is also a unique opportunity for the                     
              schools to explore innovative educational resources.
