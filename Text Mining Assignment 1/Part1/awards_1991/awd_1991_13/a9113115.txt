Abstract    :
              Coral reefs are geologically ancient ecosystems that have                      
              provided excellent historical evidence of global climatic changes              
              and some of the best indications extant of ecosystem response to               
              such changes.  Yet coral reefs are believed by some to be                      
              indicators of global climate change in more than just the                      
              historical sense.  There has been considerable recent speculation              
              in the press, discussion among reef researchers,  and testimony                
              on the topic of coral "bleaching," a phenomenon that some                      
              interpret as a stress reaction of reef corals to elevated sea                  
              surface temperature (SST's) caused by global climate change.                   
              This interpretation has been met with considerable skepticism                  
              from many in the scientific community, yet it has nonetheless                  
              captured considerable attention in the press and in Congress.                  
              Coral bleaching is a possible present indicator of climate                     
              change.  This workshop will meet a critical need to assess the                 
              state of our knowledge about coral bleaching and, in the larger                
              sense, to determine research needs for the next decade for                     
              understanding the effects of potential global climate change on                
              shallow water tropical marine ecosystems such as coral reefs.
