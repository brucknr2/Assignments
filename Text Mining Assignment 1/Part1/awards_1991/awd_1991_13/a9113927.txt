Abstract    :
                   This project supports group travel to the Enrico Fermi                    
              International School of Physics entitled "Laser Manipulation of                
              Atoms and Ions" to be held at Villa Monastero, Italy, Varenna,                 
              Italy, 9-19 July, 1991.  The objective of this school is to                    
              conduct courses related to the rapidly developing field of laser               
              manipulation, including laser cooling, electromagnetic trapping                
              of atoms and ions, and neutral atom beam optics.  Courses will                 
              also deal with applications to the study of atom-photon                        
              interactions, atomic collisions, collective effects, atomic                    
              interferometry, and atomic clocks.
