Abstract    :
                The Princeton University School of engineering and Applied                   
              Science proposes to establish and RCMS Program, Princeton                      
              Research Opportunities for Minority Engineering Students                       
              (PROMES), as a key part of a comprehensive  effort to enhance                  
              the recruitment and retention o minority undergraduate                         
              students and to provide assistance and encouragement for the                   
              students to pursue careers in engineering and applied science.                 
                  The PROMES Program will focus on increasing the number of                  
              students who prepare for graduate study in engineering, and                    
              also on encouraging both higher academic interest and                          
              achievement among participating minority students.                             
              Princeton will expand its academic advising and support                        
              services to provide for academic enrichment and career                         
              motivation.  These activities will serve a broad cross-section                 
              of Freshman engineering students.  In addition, Princeton                      
              will select thirty students (five cohorts) as PROMES Fellows                   
              over the 5 year course of the program, and match them with                     
              individual faculty mentors beginning within the Sophomore year                 
              when they have chosen a major department.  The program will                    
              build on the strongest elements of the Princeton undergraduate                 
              experience:  faculty supervision of undergraduate independent                  
              work; comfortable settings in which dialogue between faculty                   
              and students as well as among students themselves can easily                   
              take place and in which students can participate to the                        
              fullest extent; exchange among graduate and undergraduate                      
              students in an excellent research enterprise; and close                        
              advising, mentoring, and encouragement of high academic                        
              achievement.
