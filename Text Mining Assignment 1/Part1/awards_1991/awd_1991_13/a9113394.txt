Abstract    :
              This project will convene a joint US-Italy                                     
              workshop among architects, design engineers,                                   
              and policy researchers/planners with direct                                    
              experience in seismic rehabilitation and                                       
              construction to discuss the architectural aspects                              
              of seismic retrofit and reconstruction.  The focus                             
              of this workshop is the relationship between                                   
              architectural design and seismic strengthening:                                
              the unique design problems created, the                                        
              architectural concerns generated by conflicting                                
              requirements, and issues raised in construction,                               
              and the impact these changes in the built                                      
              environment have on occupants and on the                                       
              surrounding community.                                                         
                                                                                             
              While past efforts have been focused specifically                              
              on damage assessment and strengthening design,                                 
              this workshop looks at the architectural                                       
              implications of seismic strengthening and its                                  
              effect on completed buildings, as well as the                                  
              context for design policy changes.  Among the                                  
              American and the Italian participants, the                                     
              architects and engineers will address the question                             
              of how retrofit is accomplished, while the                                     
              planners and policy researchers will ask if retrofit                           
              can be accomplished socially and politically.
