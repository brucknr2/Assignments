Abstract    :
                   This award is to support a group of four professors at                    
              the University of California, Santa Cruz in two areas: (1)                     
              particle accelerator research and Cherenkov ring imaging                       
              detector development, using the linear e plus e minus collider                 
              at SLAC; and (2) a particle astrophysics experiment at Los                     
              Alamos using the CYGNUS detector array.                                        
                   The experiment at SLAC focusses upon measurements of                      
              properties of the weak neutral boson - the Z zero - and makes                  
              use of a spectrometer built from state-of-the-art particle                     
              detection devices which this group has helped to develop and                   
              fabricate.  The astrophysics experiments are concerned with                    
              observation of cosmic ray showers, particularly those due to                   
              neutral particles emanating from cosmic point sources.  The                    
              investigators bring a good deal of expertise in particle                       
              physics methodology to the astrophysics enterprises and plan,                  
              for example, to make significant improvements to the angular                   
              resolution of CYGNUS to aid in identification of the sources.                  
              A number of other contributions to both performance of CYGNUS                  
              and analysis of the data from it are also expected.
