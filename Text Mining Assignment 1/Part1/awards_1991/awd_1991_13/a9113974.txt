Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two officials of the State Committee on Science and                            
              Higher Education of the RSFSR (Russian Federation), Drs.                       
              Vladimir Kinilev and Marat Guriev, will participate in                         
              discussions with U.S. university and state education                           
              officials in a series of meetings and site visits                              
              organized by Georgetown University with primary support                        
              from the Ford Foundation.  The main purpose of including                       
              these two officials is to initiate discussions on                              
              potential cooperation on the issue of the equivalency of                       
              degrees and academic training programs between the                             
              Soviet Union and the United States.  This is becoming an                       
              increasingly important issue to both countries as                              
              growing numbers of scientists and engineers trained in                         
              the Soviet Union come to the U.S. for temporary or                             
              permanent work.
