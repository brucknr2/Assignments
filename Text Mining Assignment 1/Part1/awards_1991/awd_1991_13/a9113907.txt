Abstract    :
              A theoretical and numerical study will be undertaken for the                   
              development of microscopic models for foam rheology.  The                      
              connection between the foam structure and macroscopic                          
              properties will be developed starting from idealized                           
              situations.  The model includes the role of interfacial                        
              rheology and film-level flow.  The research will be conducted                  
              in collaboration with A. Kraynik of Sandia national                            
              Laboratories.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The project has long term applications in oil production and                   
              manufacturing of plastic and cellular plastics.
