Abstract    :
                   The Applied Algebra, Algebraic Algorithms, Error Correcting Codes         
              (AAECC 9) International Conference to be held in New Orleans on                
              October 7-10, 1991 is the ninth in a series of annual conferences and          
              the first one to be held in the United States.  The previous eight             
              conferences were held in Europe and Japan.  The aims of the meeting            
              are to guarantee through cross-fertilization, spreading of algebraic           
              techniques among different application areas, and attracting                   
              theoretical algebraists with an interest in applications to work on            
              applied problems.  An interdisciplinary conference like this is an             
              effective way to allow researchers to keep abreast of the current              
              state of the art, and this proposed one will also allow a broader              
              audience in the US to hear from its leading overseas practitioners the         
              present state of research in Computer Algebra.
