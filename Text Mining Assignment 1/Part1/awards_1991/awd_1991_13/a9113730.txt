Abstract    :
                   Support is requested so that the key contributors to                      
              research in machining and grinding in the 20th century be brought              
              together for a 2-day symposium at Oklahoma State University.  The              
              symposium will allow currently active researchers to benefit from              
              the knowledge and experience of the pioneers, before they are no               
              longer available to us.
