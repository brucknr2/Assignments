Abstract    :
              Professor Mark A. Ratner is supported by a grant from the                      
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study an                    
              extension of the static and dynamic self-consistent field                      
              technique.  Proposed development research includes the                         
              generalizaiton of static mean field techniques to work in                      
              optimized general coordinates, the use of specific correlation                 
              factors to surmount problems caused by static correlations, and                
              the use of Fourier methods in time and space to increase the                   
              efficiency of mean field calculations.  Applications research                  
              will include lifetime studies of weakly interacting molecular                  
              clusters using both static and dynamic methods, perturbative                   
              studies of weakly bound molecules, work on lineshapes in metal                 
              clusters, and time dependent dynamics in electron transfer                     
              systems.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Recent elegant laser spectroscopic advances in the field of                    
              chemistry have greatly increased our knowledge of the rates,                   
              mechanisms, and the product distributions in gas phase chemical                
              reactions.  These advances have placed new demands upon the                    
              theorist to develop, implement, and utilize theoretical tools                  
              capable of describing the results of such experiments, and to                  
              predict the behavior of reactions under differing conditions.                  
              The mean field approximation used by Professor Ratner is one                   
              successful theoretical approach to dealing with the quantum                    
              many body problems of this type.
