Abstract    :
              Nonuniformity of memory access is an almost inevitable feature of the          
              memory architecture in shared memory designs that can scale to large           
              numbers of processors, creating the increasingly important class of            
              NUMA (nonuniform memory access time) multiprocessors.  Managing the            
              placement and movement of code and data is crucial to performance in           
              NUMA architectures.  This has been called the NUMA Problem.  The I/O           
              bottleneck problem is also exacerbated by parallel architectures which         
              widen the gap between processing speed and disk speed even beyond that         
              created by improved processor technology.                                      
                                                                                             
              This project investigates operating system mechanisms and policies for         
              the management of the various levels of shared storage in such large-          
              scale shared memory multiprocessors.  The specific projects divide             
              into the following classes:  main memory management (both traditional          
              virtual memory and the migration and replication of pages among                
              various main memory modules), parallel file system design, workload            
              characterization and performance evaluation methodology and the role           
              of the programming environment in solving the NUMA Problem.
