Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Since the early 1970s, some groups of organized labor in the              
              United States have been deeply involved in issues of occupational              
              health and safety.  There is some evidence, however, that these                
              programs have not functioned as smoothly as anticipated.  This                 
              Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant conducts the                       
              preliminaries for developing a project to study the conditions that            
              promote the development and maintenance of sound and effective                 
              health and safety programs.  Interviews and data from newspapers,              
              congressional documents and union archives will provide data on                
              textile union shops in North Carolina and Tennessee to assess                  
              program maintenance costs, to determine whether labor had to make              
              concessions in order to insure the continuation of the programs,               
              to evaluate the degree of satisfaction of labor with the operation             
              of the programs, and to measure how successful the programs have               
              been in decreasing the number of accidents, injuries, illnesses and            
              deaths on the shop floors.                                                     
                                                                                             
                   This project will enhance our understanding of the importance             
              of health and safety issues under conditions of growing                        
              international competition, the weakening of the trade union                    
              movement, and the faltering of the economy.  This project also                 
              provides an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to             
              lay the foundation for conducting further research on the dynamics             
              of the protection of the health and safety of American workers.
