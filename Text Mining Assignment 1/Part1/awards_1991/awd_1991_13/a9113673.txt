Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic                      
              environment and its role in global change promoted by NSF's                    
              Arctic System Science Program.  It is a two year project to                    
              quantitatively investigate aspects of the Arctic hydrologic                    
              cycle that are most relevant to the freshwater input to the                    
              Arctic Ocean.  Existing rawinsonde data will provide the                       
              basis for computations of atmospheric water vapor                              
              convergence and of net P-E (Precipitation minus Evaporation)                   
              over the Arctic Ocean and the arctic drainage basins of                        
              northern land areas.  The computations will use daily data                     
              to obtain estimates of monthly hydrologic quantities for a                     
              30-year period, 1961-1991.
