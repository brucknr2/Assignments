Abstract    :
                The objective of this project is to determine stress and                     
              strain distributions over length scales of less than a                         
              micron through the development of novel experimental and                       
              computational techniques.  These techniques will be applied                    
              to determine the micromechanical response at fiber/matrix                      
              interface of high performance metal matrix composites.  The                    
              microscopic response of the fiber/matrix interface is                          
              believed to affect a wide range of mechanical properties of                    
              composites at the extreme conditions of high stress,                           
              temperature and cyclic loading.  A key facet of the project                    
              is the provision of research opportunities for minority                        
              students majoring in engineering at Florida A&M University.
