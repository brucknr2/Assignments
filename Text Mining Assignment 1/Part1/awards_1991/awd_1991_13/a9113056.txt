Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia                              
              workshop is to bring leading geographers together to                           
              examine and compare land use and environmental degradation                     
              in both countries.  Results of the workshop should help                        
              determine spatial extent and variations in environmental                       
              degradation and may prove useful in understanding                              
              effects on public health and economic productivity.                            
              Participants will also examine related governance and                          
              policy concerns along with issues of relevant research                         
              methodology and data adequacy for future joint efforts.                        
                                                                                             
              This cooperative geography workshop fulfills the program                       
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Central Europe                        
              to combine complementary talents and pool research                             
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                               
              competence.
