Abstract    :
              Franklin and Marshall College is establishing a connection to                  
              NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line through the PREPNET                   
              mid-level network.  The connection enhances collaborations of                  
              campus scientists with colleagues at other institutions, and                   
              allows access to libraries and other remote facilities throughout              
              the internet.  This award funds part of the costs for two                      
              years.
