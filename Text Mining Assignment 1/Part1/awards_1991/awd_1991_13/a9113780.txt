Abstract    :
                   Competitiveness in the manufacture of computers and computer              
              chips depends on many capabilities including the ability to design,            
              analyze and manufacture the uniquely structured thin films that                
              make up electronic devices.  Transport phenomenon such as heat and             
              mass transfer and ion diffusion and scattering are critical in the             
              control of chip quality and cost.  This research will enhance                  
              industry-university collaboration on the modeling and solution                 
              methods of transport mechanisms for discretely inhomogeneous,                  
              multi-dimensional media (electronic thin-film devices).                        
                   A unique modeling and analysis approach called discrete                   
              element analysis will be developed with the potential to enhance               
              present efforts to integrate geometry, analysis, design and                    
              manufacturing to improve engineering efficiency and effectiveness.             
              The important role played by transport processes in manufacturing              
              will be highlighted throughout with active knowledge transfer                  
              mechanisms between the university and industrial collaborators.
