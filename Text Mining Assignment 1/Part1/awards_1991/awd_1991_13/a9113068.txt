Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program is supporting in                   
              part the Richard Bernstein Symposium on April 19 and 20, 1991                  
              at the University of California at Los Angeles.  This is a                     
              symposium on molecular dynamics in memory of the late Richard                  
              Bernstein, one of the founders of this field. The use of                       
              molecular beams has transformed the field of chemical reactions                
              from the macroscopic to the molecular levels and Richard                       
              Bernstein was one of the leading scientists who was                            
              instrumental in the rapid advancement of this field.

              This symposium will allow graduate students to interact with                   
              the different contributors to the field of molecular dynamics,                 
              and be exposed to the most recent developments in                              
              state-selected, oriented or aligned molecules dissociating or                  
              reacting in beams or on surfaces.
