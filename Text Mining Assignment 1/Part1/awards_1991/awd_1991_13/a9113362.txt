Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will establish a Research Training Group in the                     
              Analysis of Biological Diversification.  The faculty group                     
              includes members of the Departments of Molecular and Cellular                  
              Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and Geology.  The                   
              funds awarded will provide stipends for undergraduate, graduate                
              and post-doctoral trainees, and will defray part of the cost of                
              trainee's research.  In addition, funds will be used to purchase               
              specialized research equipment to be used by trainees and to                   
              bring investigators from other research and academic institutions              
              to the campus for seminars.  University resources will augment                 
              the funds provided by NSF in most of these categories.                         
                                                                                             
              Molecular, developmental, and population biologists, as well as                
              systematists, ecologists and paleontologists, have developed                   
              distinctive approaches to the study of biological diversity.                   
              Owing to the way in which students have been trained                           
              traditionally, the connections among these approaches have not                 
              been explored in detail.  While their individual research                      
              interests are as diverse as the list above, the faculty have                   
              formed this group with the aim of using phylogeny, which can be                
              viewed as the history of diversification, as an approach to the                
              integration of these disparate perspectives.
