Abstract    :
              A comprehensive theoretical investigation of unipolar                          
              avalanche multiplication in II-V multiple-quantum-                             
              well (MQW) semiconductor structures is proposed.                               
              A description of intraband avalanche processes in                              
              quantum wells, which we expect to be the most                                  
              complete such description available, will first be                             
              developed.  This model will then be applied to the                             
              study of avalanche multiplication in a variety of                              
              (mostly hitherto unexplored) III-V quantum-well                                
              systems, including structures which incorporate                                
              strained layers.  Theoretical predictions will finally be                      
              obtained for characteristics of avalanche photodiodes                          
              utilizing MQW's which, based upon our model, are                               
              expected to exhibit high gains and/or operation at                             
              highly desirable wavelengths.
