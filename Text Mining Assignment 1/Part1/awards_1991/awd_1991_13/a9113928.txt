                   This grant provides partial support for a workshop on                     
              Giant Resonances and Related Phenomena, to be held at                          
              University of Notre Dame 21-23 October 1991.  The workshop                     
              will be attended by physicists active in the study of nuclear                  
              reaction giant resonances.
