Abstract    :
              This award from the Office of Special Projects will enable the                 
              participation of twelve young U.S. chemists in an NSF-Science                  
              and Engineering Research Council "(SERC) "Workshop for Younger                 
              Chemists" in the area of dynamics of molecule-surface interac-                 
              tions.  The three-day workshop will be held July 22-24, 1991 at                
              the University of Liverpool, Liverpool, England.                               
                                                                                             
              The workshop will expose chemists in the field of molecule-sur-                
              face interactions to the broader community of international                    
              scholarship for the purpose of establishing long-term bridges                  
              for productive research collaboration and knowledge exchange.                  
              All participants have made significant contributions to this                   
              field.  The number of participants is limited to 24, 12 from                   
              each side.  Through an open discussion of ideas and unpublished                
              results, the workshop will provide a perspective of the                        
              important problems in the field and establish a solid                          
              foundation for future significant research.
