Abstract    :
                   The American Physical Society, in cooperation with the                    
              American Association of Physics Teachers, will operate a                       
              continuation of the project, "Participation of the Physics                     
              Research Community in Undergraduate Curriculum Development".                   
              The previous grant supported two workshops:  the first in                      
              Santa Fe in June 1990, and the second in Denver in November                    
              1990.  The workshops resulted in specific recommendations in                   
              two main areas:  (1) the infusion of core courses with results                 
              from modern research topics, and (2) the upgrading of the                      
              junior/senior physics laboratory with modern experiments and                   
              the dissemination of good experiments.  To achieve the next                    
              step, pilot programs in these two areas will be supervised by                  
              the APS and AAPT.  Based on the results of the pilot testing,                  
              full proposals will be developed.
