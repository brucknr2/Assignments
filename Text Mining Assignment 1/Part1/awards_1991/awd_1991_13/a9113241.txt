Abstract    :
                   Design of structures in geologic media, such as rock masses,              
              is different from designing a conventional structure - a building              
              or a bridge.  In dealing with geologic  media, the designer is                 
              faced with complex rock masses, the specific in situ properties of             
              which cannot be pre-scribed.  There are three research elements:               
              (1) based on the axiomatic design approach, investigation will be              
              concentrated on advancing a hypothesis featuring design principles             
              for geologic media;  (2) these principles will be incorporated in              
              a framework of design methodology devised specifically for geologic            
              media; and (3) a major case history, involving an underground                  
              nuclear waste repository, will be used to verify the proposed                  
              hypothesis.  Undergraduate and graduate students will assist in                
              compiling the design information in a form also suitable for use               
              in the classroom.                                                              
                   The research activity is significant as geologic media are                
              involved in a wide range of human endeavors and improved design in             
              geologic media will allow improvement of the environment, mitigate             
              natural and man-made hazards, and construct engineered facilities              
              to improve the quality of life.
