Abstract    :
                The Morehouse College Research Scholars Program is designed                  
              to increase the number of science students who attend graduate                 
              school and earn the doctorate degree in science.  The                          
              objectives of the program are:  1) to motivate students                        
              toward careers in science research through a coordinated                       
              mentoring program; 2)  to provide participants in the program                  
              with early research experiences, beginning with a prefreshman                  
              summer program; 3) to enhance the academic preparation of                      
              students through enrichment courses, counseling, mentoring,                    
              colloquia, and seminars; and 4) to provide students with                       
              information on graduate schools, fellowships and research                      
              careers.  The program consists of four components to                           
              accomplish the stated objectives:  1) an academic year                         
              research and enrichment program for undergraduates;  2) a                      
              prefreshman summer research and enrichment program;  3) summer                 
              research activities for upperclassmen; and 4) coordinated                      
              mentoring/counseling program.  The project will serve a target                 
              group of up to fifteen scholastically talented undergraduates                  
              at the College who are science majors.  These students will be                 
              assigned to faculty mentors who will direct their research                     
              projects and serve as academic advisors.  The participants                     
              will enroll in enrichment courses, and participate in student                  
              colloquia and departmental seminars.  Emphasis will be placed                  
              on a coordinated mentoring/counseling program to ensure the                    
              students' academic and research progress.  It is expected that                 
              the Research Scholars Program will significantly increase the                  
              number of Morehouse graduates who pursue doctorates in the                     
              sciences over the next five to ten years.
