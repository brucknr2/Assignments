Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific                              
              investigation to study the properties of the Arctic ocean,                     
              atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast Water (NEW)                   
              Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order                    
              to gain an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope                      
              processes.  This element of the NEW program will evaluate                      
              the role of heterotrophic microorganisms on organic                            
              materials produced within the polynya.  It will test the                       
              hypothesis that low temperatures severely restrict the                         
              degradative functions of microorganisms associated with                        
              organic particulates produced within the polynya and                           
              available for export beyond its boundaries.  It will also                      
              assay for temporal shifts in microbial community size,                         
              structure and complexity.
