Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                 
              Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Hall will use ab                  
              initio full-gradient geometry optimization techniques,                         
              including multiconfiguration self-consistent-field and                         
              configuration interaction methods to solve problems of current                 
              interest in inorganic and organometallic chemistry.  He will                   
              continue methods development in three areas.  To improve the                   
              time to solution on multiprocessing computers, he will continue                
              working on parallel code of which the gradient section is now                  
              complete.  In order to handle large numbers of electrons and                   
              orbitals, he will implement a modification of the complete                     
              active space multiconfiguration self-consistent-field                          
              technique.  Lastly, he will continue the use of and improve the                
              understanding of the topological method of analysis due to                     
              Bader.  The systems to be studied are related to three                         
              fundamental steps in catalysis: oxidative-addition,                            
              substitution, and migratory-insertion.  Specifically, he will                  
              examine several important questions about the nature of the C-H                
              activation.  The methods to be utilized will allow him to draw                 
              conclusions about a group of closely related molecules with                    
              modest basis sets and a moderate degree of electron correlation.

              Professor Hall will perform theoretical compuations that will                  
              aid in understanding the elementary steps in a number of                       
              chemical reactions that are important in catalytic processes.
