Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award establishes a new ion beam facility which will be used              
              to address issues in materials research at the University of                   
              Pennsylvania.   A unique opportunity exists to apply ion scattering            
              to a variety of exciting materials problems, some of which involve             
              new kinds of experiments which advance the state-of-the-art ion                
              scattering techniques.  A major aspect of this research is the                 
              determination of chemical composition and its variation near                   
              interfaces and in thin films.  This new ion beam facility extends              
              across a wide range of research programs, which include studies of             
              the distribution of dopants in near-surface regions of polymer                 
              based electrolytes and conducting polymers, the composition profile            
              across interfaces in polymers (welding) and at polymer surfaces                
              (adhesion, surface, modification), the progression of the                      
              transformation of thin films of polymer precursors to boron-based              
              ceramics, epitaxial growth of thin layers (metal, silicide, and                
              metal on ceramic), hydrogen on and near the surface of metals, and             
              surface and interface studies of surface active impurities in                  
              metals and ceramics (interface embrittlement).
