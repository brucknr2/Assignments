Abstract    :
              This project will organize an international workshop to                        
              evaluate the current state-of-the-art on the reliability                       
              based design procedures applied to timber structures.  The                     
              project is conducted jointly with the NATO International                       
              Scientific Exchange Programs.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The workshop is planned for late fall 1991 in Colorado.                        
                                                                                             
              Proceedings of the workshop will be widely distributed.
