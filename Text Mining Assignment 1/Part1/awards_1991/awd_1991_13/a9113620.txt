Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the construction of a powder X-ray diffraction             
              system.  The completed system will provide high sample throughput and          
              allow for control of the sample environment such as temperature.  The          
              instrument is essential for use in materials studies of thin carbon            
              films grown on silicon and calcium fluoride substrates,                        
              characterization of reaction products in solid state synthesis,                
              studies of polymeric sponges (solvation and desolvation of lattice             
              calathrates).  The instrument will be housed in the department's               
              crystallography laboratory, and available to all qualified users.  It          
              will also be designed to be used as a training instrument for an               
              undergraduate chemistry instructional course given by the department.
