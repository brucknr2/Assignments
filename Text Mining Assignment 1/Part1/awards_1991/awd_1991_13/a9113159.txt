Abstract    :
                Our program supports Native American Students who declare                    
              themselves forestry majors at Northern Arizona University.                     
              Enrichment activities support  retention.  We will address                     
              family and community participation, cultural dissonance,                       
              and the cause of low student self-esteem.  Central to the                      
              effort will be a full-time Native American professional                        
              counselor/advisor.  The program will fund visits and                           
              communication between family members and School of Forestry                    
              faculty and students.  Native American professionals will                      
              become involved as role model/mentors and advisors.  Inclusion                 
              of Native American professionals will become involvement as                    
              role model/mentors and advisors.  Inclusion of Native American                 
              values, tradition, and knowledge in the undergraduate                          
              curriculum will be a priority.  The first year student                         
              research program will focus on the content of the junior year                  
              curriculum; a faculty member with primary responsibility for                   
              that curriculum will supervise the summer research work, which                 
              will be conducted by the Native Americans who have completed                   
              the junior year course work.  In future years, the research                    
              agenda will continue to relate to the curriculum, with                         
              additional effort motivated by problems defined in                             
              consultation with tribal forestry departments.  Our measures                   
              of success are increased in (1) graduation rates of Native                     
              Americans and (2) numbers of Native Americans pursuing                         
              advanced degrees in science.
