Abstract    :
                   This research will extend and augment previous work on                    
              knowledge-based machine fault diagnosis, using artificial neural               
              networks.  The starting point of this effort will be the                       
              framework of previous machine monitoring research.  Analytical                 
              modeling of behavioral phenomenon will be carried out to                       
              establish quantitative and qualititative relationships of spatial              
              considerations and fault diagnosis models.  This modeling will be              
              interfaced to the real world to carry out intelligent monitoring.              
                   Intelligent monitoring of machine tools for diagnostic                    
              purposes is of great importance in automated manufacturing                     
              environments.  This work is being conducted in close cooperation               
              with a major manufacturing organization and is likely to yield                 
              important results.
