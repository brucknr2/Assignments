Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Professor James J. Valentini of                     
              Columbia University will study the state-to-state dynamics of                  
              photodissociation and photo-induced reactions in van der Waals                 
              and hydrogen-bonded molecular complexes.  The research                         
              addresses the influence of many-body interactions, solvent                     
              effects, cage effects, mode-selective or bond-selective                        
              chemistry, and steric effects in these reactions.  The clusters                
              will be excited to a specific vibrational mode via stimulated                  
              Raman excitation, and photofragments or reaction products will                 
              be detected using laser-induced fluorescence or multiphoton                    
              ionization.

              The study of molecular complexes which are held together with                  
              bonds which are weaker than chemical bonds impacts our                         
              understanding of many phenomena.  For example, the way solids                  
              and liquids are formed from condensing vapors or the conditions                
              under which certain surfaces catalyze chemical reactions are                   
              governed by the physical forces that hold the separate chemical                
              species together.  An understanding of the role of these forces                
              in weakly bound complexes is a major goal of this current                      
              project.
