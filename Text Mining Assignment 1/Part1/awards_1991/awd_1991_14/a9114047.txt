Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project consists of two research parts:                                   
              (1) verification and utilization as a                                          
              proposed controller of a new system                                            
              identification (SI) technique, and (2) study                                   
              of two active control schemes, i.e., the                                       
              modified Luenberger pole placement and neural                                  
              control algorithms, for the active control of                                  
              structures against earthquakes.  The main                                      
              objective is to investigate the feasibility                                    
              and application of these two control schemes                                   
              in protection of civil engineering structures                                  
              under seismic conditions.                                                      
                                                                                             
              A 10-story apartment building in San Jose,                                     
              California whose 13 seismic instruments have                                   
              recorded many earthquake response data will                                    
              be analyzed to validate a system                                               
              identification technique which is capable of                                   
              identifying the structural dynamic model from                                  
              the measured response records and without                                      
              knowing the seismic input.  This SI technique                                  
              will be incorporated into the formulation of                                   
              two control schemes, whose feasibility and                                     
              effectiveness will then be studied.                                            
                                                                                             
              This project contains an important component                                   
              of Research Opportunity Awards (ROA) and                                       
              provides collaborative support for a faculty                                   
              researcher from a historically minority                                        
              institution.
