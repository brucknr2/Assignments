Abstract    :
              This award supports two visits over a two-year period by Dr. Paul              
              I. Abell of the University of Rhode Island to the University of                
              Western Australia, to work with Drs. Karl-Heinz Wyrwoll, Jane C.               
              Newsome, and George Kendrick.  Mindful of the current debate on                
              whether global warming and the greenhouse effect, brought on by                
              various forms of atmospheric pollution, pose a threat to our                   
              global environment, the investigators propose examining past                   
              climatic changes in paleoclimates to map their temporal and                    
              geographic extent to give some warming of the magnitude of                     
              climatically-induced catastrophes.  Specifically, they will                    
              investigate the extent of the Younger Davis reglaciation event of              
              10,000 years ago, in western Australia, a region remote from its               
              putative source (meltwater diversion from glaciers in central                  
              Canada).  The investigators will use techniques of stable isotope              
              ratios of oxygen in the aragonitic shells of land gastropod                    
              shells (techniques pioneered by Dr. Abell in studies of climatic               
              change in central and southern Africa) to provide a proxy for                  
              climate change.  The isotopic studies at the University of Rhode               
              Island will be paralleled by pollen and sediment geomorphology                 
              studies by collaborators at the University of Western Australia.               
              Knowledge of what produced that event, how quickly it achieved                 
              its maximum, and how long it lasted, are crucial in understanding              
              what to expect in future climatic changes.
