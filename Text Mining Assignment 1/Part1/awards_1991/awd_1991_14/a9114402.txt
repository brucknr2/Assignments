Abstract    :
                   This research draws on ideas from spatial statistics and                  
              from Bayesian image analysis to devise experimental designs for                
              agricultural field experiements or other experiments on                        
              experimental material that can be thought of as lying on a map.                
              This research has wider implications for mapping of incidence,                 
              for representation of patterns, and for robustness of Bayesian                 
              inference particularly  in the presence of spatial correlations.
