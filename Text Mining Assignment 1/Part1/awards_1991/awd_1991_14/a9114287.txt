Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic                      
              environment and its role in global change promoted by NSF's                    
              Arctic System Science Program.  It is a two year project to                    
              investigate the role of arctic sediments in denitrification                    
              processes.  The proposal addresses a fundamental problem in                    
              marine chemistry/geochemistry  - the long-term balance of                      
              the fixed nitrogen content of the oceans.  As there is good                    
              evidence that the fixed nitrogen content of the oceans is                      
              not presently balanced and knowing that availability of 'N'                    
              can control marine productivity, this is an issue that is                      
              fundamental to the study of global ocean fluxes and the                        
              linkages between ocean chemical cycles and climate.
