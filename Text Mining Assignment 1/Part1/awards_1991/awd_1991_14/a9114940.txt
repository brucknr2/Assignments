Abstract    :
              One of the most reliable signatures of the youngest observable                 
              stars is the emission of their infrared CO spectral lines from a               
              wind or a pair of collimated bipolar jets.  The source of this                 
              energetic outflow is still unknown, but there are reasons to                   
              believe that the energy for this particle ejection comes from                  
              the infall of matter from a circumstellar accretion disk. The                  
              matter is then deflected by a combination of magnetic and stellar              
              rotation forces and ejected in a collimated flow.  The object                  
              of this proposal is to study the emission profiles of CO, hydrogen,            
              oxygen, and lines of other elements in order to test the                       
              correctness "x-celerator" model. The Principal Investigator and                
              his Co-Investigator have just constructed a high dispersion                    
              infrared spectrograph that they will use for this program at                   
              the infrared telescopes on Mauna Kea Observatory, Hawaii. They                 
              will use their data to constrain the kinematical models for                    
              observed flows and work closely with the originator of the                     
              x-celerator model, Dr. Frank Shu of U. Calif. Berkeley. The                    
              results of this investigation are expected to have application                 
              not only to young stars but to other sites where bipolar jets                  
              have been observed, such as the nuclei of "active" galaxies.
