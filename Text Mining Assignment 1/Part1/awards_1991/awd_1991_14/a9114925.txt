Abstract    :
              Two of the most esoteric kinds of astrophysical objects in the                 
              Universe are the neutron star and the black hole.  The Principal               
              Investigator (PI) proposes to continue his studies for another                 
              three years of the fundamental physics of these objects and their              
              influence on matter just outside them.  During this grant period               
              attention will be focussed on quantum field effects on the                     
              equations of state of fluids in these objects, black holes and                 
              gravitational collapse, and the structure of red supergiants having            
              neutron stars in their cores.  An important aspect of this proposal            
              is the PI's training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows             
              in this area.  The PI is widely known for his instructional                    
              abilities which  have provided a pool of scientists conversant in              
              theoretical astrophysics, particle physics, and General Relativity             
              for over twenty years.
