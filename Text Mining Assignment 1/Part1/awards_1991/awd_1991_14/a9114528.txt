Abstract    :
                   A program of experimental research is directed to the study               
              of atomic and molecular processes in intense short-pulsed                      
              radiation fields produced by multi-gigawatt pulsed lasers with                 
              durations of 150 fsec to 100 psec.  Objectives include:  (1)                   
              examination of the role of coherence in above-threshold                        
              ionization (ATI), by utilizing novel 2-color radiation fields                  
              where the phases of the two colors are locked together, and by                 
              creating very wide bandwidth chirped pulses for ionization                     
              studies; (2) an attempt to observe and study novel laser-induced               
              molecular bound states, formed and stabilized by the intense                   
              laser field (existence of such states was suggested by the recent              
              discovery of bond-softening, or above-threshold dissociation, in               
              intense laser-molecule interactions); and (3) a study of the                   
              interaction of atoms with single cycles of infrared optical                    
              radiation, using recently developed technology to produce and                  
              control coherent radiation pulses consisting of a single optical               
              cycle.
