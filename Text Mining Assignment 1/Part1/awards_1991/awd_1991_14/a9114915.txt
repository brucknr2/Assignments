Abstract    :
              The conference objective is to gather the proper                               
              mix of professionals, chosen among the leading                                 
              scientists in the world, who represent various                                 
              disciplines of science that combine to form                                    
              molecular electronics.  This gathering will review                             
              the state of those arts from the perspective of                                
              molecular electronics.  Such a gathering can provide                           
              cross-fertilization of ideas and (if possible) create                          
              actual collaborations.  Yet another object of the                              
              conference is to publicly discuss recent scientific                            
              advances related to molecular electronics.
