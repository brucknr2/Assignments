Abstract    :
                   Dr. Peter Connors is the Reserve Manager of the Bodega                    
              Marine Laboratory, which is operated by the University of                      
              California at Davis and is a part of the University of California              
              Reserve System.  Dr. Connors proposes construction of a research               
              greenhouse, to be dedicated to research on terrestrial plants and              
              plant/insect interactions of the coastal terrace.  Two small                   
              temporary greenhouses have been used by visiting investigators                 
              but the projected needs will soon saturate the space available.                
              In addition, a recently hired faculty member has an active                     
              research program that requires greenhouse space.                               
                   The greenhouse planned for the Bodega Marine Laboratory is a              
              creative expansion of the Lab's research impact.  The greenhouse               
              will attract an increasing number of visiting scientists and                   
              students, and will broaden the range of natural phenomena studied              
              at the Lab.  The resulting studies of coastal plants and their                 
              associated insects will provide important new insights into the                
              ecology and management of the ocean margin zone.
