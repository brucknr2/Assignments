Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator intends to do research on the class of              
              short-period Algol-type binaries to study the effects of the impact            
              of a gas stream from the companion star onto the surface of the                
              accreting star.  This process is known as the star-stream                      
              interaction.  This study will encompass both observational and                 
              theoretical work.  In the first case, the properties of the                    
              circumstellar material which results from the star-stream                      
              interaction will be obtained from an analysis of observations of               
              the H alpha line profile of several binaries.  While in the latter             
              case, extensive numerical hydrodynamical calculations will be make             
              to determine the expected character of the impact region and any               
              other circumstellar material which might result from the impact.               
              The National Observatories and National Supercomputing Centers will            
              be used for this research.  This work is important because it will             
              show how the evolution of a star is influenced by its membership               
              in a close interacting binary, like the short-period Algol-type                
              binaries.//
