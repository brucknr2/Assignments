Abstract    :
                   Arithmetic algebraic geometry is a rapidly growing area of                
              mathematics.  This project will focus on Galois representations                
              arising from modular forms and/or the cohomology of algebraic                  
              varieties.  In particular, two main themes will be addressed: (1)              
              Serre's conjectures on modular forms and Galois representations                
              and (2) topics arising from the Galois action on the cohomology                
              of algebraic varieties.                                                        
                   This project will support a workshop in Arithmetic Algebraic              
              Geometry to be held at Sundance, Utah from May 13-19, 1992.  The               
              workshop will concentrate on Galois representations arising from               
              modular forms and/or the cohomology of algebraic varieties.  The               
              conference is designed to emphasize current research, to focus on              
              open questions, and to facilitate new work.
