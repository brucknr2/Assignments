Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to study how ultrasonic waves                
              scatter from partially closed cracks and other imperfect                       
              interfaces.  An important part of this research is developing a                
              model for such interfaces that takes account of surfaces roughness             
              and the partial contact between crack or bond faces.  An equally               
              important part is developing a model of the measurement process                
              that accounts for the transmitting and receiving characteristics               
              of the transducers.  The results of this research will enable more             
              complete, quantitative information about such cracks and interfaces            
              to be extracted from scattered ultrasonic signals.  Examples of                
              such quantitative information include the size of a fatigue crack              
              and an estimate of the strength of a diffusion bond.  Such                     
              information enables one to assess quantitatively the quality and               
              reliability of manufactured parts.  The approach used is                       
              interactive.  It involves a combination of analytical and numerical            
              approaches whose outcomes will be continuously compared.  Moreover,            
              the predictions from these calculations will be continuously                   
              compared with existing data from measurements carried out at the               
              Center for Nondestructive Evaluation at Iowa State University.
