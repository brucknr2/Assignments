Abstract    :
              This project will continue research on the average and probabilistic           
              settings of information-based complexity.  The goal is to                      
              investigate when intractability or noncomputability in the                     
              deterministic worst case setting can be avoided by using randomness or         
              by using average and probabilistic settings.  In addition,                     
              two new research directions will be pursued.  The first is                     
              probabilistic complexity for piece-wise smooth functions.                      
              The second is the relation between complexity and stability.
