Abstract    :
              This award supports one visit in the first year by Dr. Simon C.                
              Moss, and one by post-doctoral researcher P.C. Chow, of the                    
              University of Houston, University Park, and one each in the                    
              second year, to CSIRO, Clayton, Victoria, Australia, to work with              
              Dr. Stephen W. Wilkins of the Division of Materials Science and                
              Technology on the Division of Materials Science and Technology on              
              the x-ray microstructural characterization of thin films and                   
              multilayers of semiconductors produced by various means.  The                  
              researchers intend to select a few materials for intensive study               
              and join their respective instrumental and theoretical skills to               
              develop new insights and analytical methods.  The research topics              
              include:  (1) semiconductor multilayer (superlattice) structures;              
              (2) studies of interfaces in incoherent structures; and (3)                    
              studies of ordering, vibrational effects and localized                         
              distortions within multilayer and thin-film structures.  The                   
              three topics are somewhat interrelated in that they require very               
              careful attention to data collection and to scattering theory.
