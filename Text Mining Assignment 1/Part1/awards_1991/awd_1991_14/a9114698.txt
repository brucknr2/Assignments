Abstract    :
              The electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of                          
              the boron nitride and silicon carbide films will be                            
              investigated prior to and after x-ray synchrotron                              
              radiation.  The electrical measurement will be                                 
              conducted on capacitor structures consisting of                                
              highly doped (0.0025 -cm) p-type silicon substrates                            
              with overlying films of aluminum to serve as the                               
              base electrode, the boron nitride dielectric, and                              
              aluminum dots evaporated through a metal shadow                                
              mask.  Only compositions deemed suitable for x-ray                             
              membranes will undergo such tests.  The                                        
              dependence of current density on electric field will                           
              be examined to determine the prevalent conduction                              
              mechanism in the material as well as the influence                             
              of radiation dose on the potential change in the                               
              electrical behavior.
