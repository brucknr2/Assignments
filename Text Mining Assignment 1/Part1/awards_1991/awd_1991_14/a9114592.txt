Abstract    :
              Reliable anchors are required to safely develop the strength of                
              composite prestressing tendons.  A program is presented to define,             
              test and evaluate mechanical, swaged and resin socketed anchors.               
              Both static and fatigue characteristics of the anchor system will              
              be evaluated.  Finite element analysis, which includes modelling               
              the slip plane surfaces initiate the program.  Physical samples                
              will be manufactured and tested for both solid rod composite                   
              tendons and stranded wire type composite rods.
