Abstract    :
              A newly developed method which incorporates a parametrized, quantum            
              mechanical, nearest neighbor total energy expression for silicon               
              into a "ficticious Lagrangian" molecular dynamics scheme developed             
              by Car and Parinello will be expanded to model the germanium-                  
              silicon solid solution system.  A novel full range, parametrized               
              total energy expression for the germanium-silicon system based on              
              the local density approximation with complete transferability will             
              be constructed.  This total energy expression is parameterized                 
              against a large data base which is derived from experiment and                 
              state of the art local density approximation calculations.                     
              Computationally, it will only be slightly more demanding than the              
              calculations for silicon alone, and finite temperature simulations             
              of hundreds of atoms could be performed in tens of Cray YMP hours,             
              a factor of about 50 more rapidly than the best local density                  
              approximation calculations.  The study of the epitaxial growth of              
              germanium-silicon will be done by breaking the problem into smaller            
              components which can be studied individually; namely, relaxation of            
              surfaces, steps and kinks, sticking and diffusion of an atom on                
              this surface, dynamics of atoms near a relaxed kink, and growth of             
              kinks into steps.                                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              Computational techniques will be developed to model the total                  
              energies of germanium-silicon mixtures - an important material for             
              the electronics industry.  The proposed technique will accelerate              
              the calculation of important properties.  The proposed techniques              
              have the potential to have a major impact on the way that these                
              properties are calculated and can be applied to other materials of             
              scientific and commercial interest.
