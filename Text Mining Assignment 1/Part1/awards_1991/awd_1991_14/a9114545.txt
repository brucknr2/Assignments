Abstract    :
              Two groups of topics will be studied.  The first group deals with              
              approximation algorithms.  Since for many important problems exact             
              solution cannot be determined in reasonable time, one needs to provide         
              as good solutions as possible, given the available computational               
              resources.  The investigators will concentrate on two paradigms:               
              local search heuristics and relaxations of integer linear programs.            
              The design and analysis of heuristics for combinatorial optimization           
              problems is proposed.  Problems of relevance to Numerical Analysis and         
              Circuit Design are emphasized.  The second group deals with reliable           
              computations of neural networks.  The goal of this research is to              
              determine the adequacy of neural networks as a computational                   
              abstraction of the brain.  The starting point of this study is the             
              observation that the brain computes reliably in spite of unreliable            
              individual components.  Existing methods for constructing fault-               
              tolerant bounded degree networks will be used in combination with new          
              techniques to handle unbounded fan-in processing elements.
