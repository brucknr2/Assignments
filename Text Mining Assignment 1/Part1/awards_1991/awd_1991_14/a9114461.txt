Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Kalyanasundaram Seshadri of                      
              the University of California at San Diego (UCSD), to                           
              collaborate with Professor Norbert Peters of the Institute                     
              for Mechanics at the Technical University of Aachen (RWTH),                    
              Germany.  The principal objective of their joint research                      
              is to clarify the influence of strain imposed by the fluid                     
              flow on the rate of formation of benzene in laminar flames.                    
              They will focus their research on diffusion flames, and use                    
              as test fuels methane, ethane and propane.  Experimental                       
              measurements will be made at UCSD to characterize the                          
              structure of the reaction zone and the values of strain                        
              rates beyond which the yellow luminous zone in the flame                       
              disappears.  The German group will carry out the numerical                     
              calculations to determine the structure of the flame for                       
              various values of the rate of strain.   The two groups will                    
              work together in the asymptotic analysis to determine the                      
              structure of the reaction zone and predict the rates of                        
              formation of benzene in the flame.  This division of labor                     
              will effectively exploit the complementary strengths of the                    
              two research groups.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This research is directly related to the formation of soot,                    
              as well as benzene, in diffusion flames.  Soot reflects as                     
              well as exacerbates reduced efficiency in combustion                           
              engines.  An improved understanding of the mechanisms of                       
              the formation of benzene and soot could suggest improved                       
              techniques for reducing pollutant formation and improving                      
              efficiency in diesel and gas turbine engines.
