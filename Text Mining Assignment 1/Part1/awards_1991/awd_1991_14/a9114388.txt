Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research objective is the development of a general analytic                
              theory of the motion of asymmetric rigid bodies subject to                     
              arbitrary forces and torques.  A secondary objective will be to                
              develop control schemes for the motion which take advantage of                 
              the analytic solutions.  The theory would comprise finding closed              
              form solutions for the Eulerian angular velocities, the Eulerian               
              angles, and the angular momentum vector in inertial space.  The                
              results will have a fundamental impact on practical applications               
              in terms of the analysis and control of finite sized rigid                     
              bodies, particularly spinning space vehicles.
