Abstract    :
              An analytical model will be constructed to determine                           
              details of the physical mechanisms which govern the                            
              behavior and performance of lip seals.  The model will                         
              consist of an analysis of the deformation of the lip                           
              surface, an analysis of the flow field within the                              
              lubricating film between the lip and the shaft, and an                         
              iterative computational procedure.  The flow field will be                     
              analyzed using a finite differences approach to the                            
              Reynolds equation, an approach which is capable of handling                    
              cavitation.  For small scale apserities and rough surfaces                     
              an averaged Reynolds equation will be employed in the                          
              analysis.  The deformation analysis will rely on an                            
              influence coefficient approach based on finite element                         
              analysis.  The effects of lip geometry will be determined                      
              and the results compared with published experimental data.                     
              The possibilities of microengineering lip surfaces for                         
              improved performance will be evaluated.
