Abstract    :
              This project examines the transient responses of cracked rotating              
              shafts.  It comprises an analytical and experimental component.                
              In the analytical part, the crack will be represented by                       
              concentrated forces and moments, and will be assumed to open and               
              close during the motion depending on the conditions at the crack               
              location.  The shaft will be accelerated or decelerated through                
              one or more critical speeds, and the response will be determined               
              with the use of Galerkin's method.  The effects of acceleration                
              and deceleration rate, crack depth, crack position and                         
              eccentricity will be investigated.  Approximate formulas for the               
              maximum response will be sought.  In the experimental part of                  
              this project, laser scan data will be obtained from both                       
              uncracked and cracked shaft models and correlated with the                     
              analytically equivalent models.  As a result of this study, it is              
              expected that there will be an improved understanding of the                   
              behavior of cracked structures, and that improved diagnostic                   
              procedures for detecting small cracks in various types of                      
              rotating machinery will emerge.***  //
