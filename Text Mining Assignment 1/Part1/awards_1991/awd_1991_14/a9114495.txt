Abstract    :
              The project will enable the Department of Chemistry to obtain                  
              graphics workstations to enhance an extant PC-facility that has                
              become outdated and inadequate for the teaching of up-to-date                  
              computational techniques.  The new facility will make it                       
              possible to include independent projects and assignments                       
              requiring student access to powerful graphics computers in                     
              present courses as well as allowing the establishment of a new                 
              course entitled "Computations in Chemistry."  The Department                   
              houses several active and well-equipped theoretical chemistry                  
              research groups, covering a broad range of computational                       
              chemistry, that will provide software and expertise for the                    
              teaching program.

              With this award the Division of Chemistry will support a course                
              and curriculum development project spearheaded by Dr. Hanness                  
              Jonsson and including a group of four other research active                    
              chemists in the Department of Chemistry at the University of                   
              Washington.  The group will establish a computational facility,                
              consisting of several graphics workstations, to be used for                    
              upper division undergraduate and graduate student teaching.
