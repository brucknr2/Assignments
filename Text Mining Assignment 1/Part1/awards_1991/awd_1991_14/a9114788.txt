Abstract    :
                   Current composite forming techniques suffer greatly from a                
              lack of understanding of the forming principles at a fundamental               
              physical level.  The purpose of the project is to develop this                 
              fundamental understanding, emphasizing particularly the effects                
              of geometry on formability.  The research will concentrate on                  
              developing mathematical models and computational schemes that                  
              relate the material deformation modes necessary to form complex                
              shapes to geometric features.  The forming characteristics of                  
              other advanced composite materials, including woven materials,                 
              where weave pattern and fiber architecture will be critical, and               
              long, discontinuous fiber composites, where material thinning is               
              a particular problem will also be addressed.  This work will be                
              based primarily on experiments, and models of composites                       
              deformation and failure modes.  To handle the vast array of part               
              shapes and possible fiber paths, computer aided design techniques              
              will be used, modified with appropriate calculation procedures.                
                   The final result of this study will be "Design for                        
              Manufacture" guidelines for forming composites.  Such guidelines               
              will be very useful for industry, and for the aerospace industry               
              in particular.
