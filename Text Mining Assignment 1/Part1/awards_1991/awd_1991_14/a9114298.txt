Abstract    :
                   This is a grant to give partial support for the 2nd Conference            
              on Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization in                       
              Pittsburgh, PA on May 25-27, 1992.  Over the last ten years a great            
              deal of progress has been made in this area.  Many very important              
              economic problems can be posed as Integer Programs.  Continued                 
              breakthroughs in this area will be highly leveraged in terms of                
              economic impact.
