Abstract    :
              This award will support a U.S.-Mexico scientific collaboration                 
              between Professor Juan Sanchez of the the University of Texas,                 
              Austin and Professors J. L. Moran Lopez and F. Mejia Lira of the               
              Physics Department of the University of San Luis de Potosi,                    
              Mexico.  The purpose of this collaboration is the                              
              characterization of magnetic interactions and of planar defects,               
              such as surfaces, on alloy phase stability.  Several real and                  
              model alloy systems will be investigated using the cluster                     
              variation method of statistical mechanics, from which accurate                 
              configurational free energies may be calculated.                               
                                                                                             
              The collaboration builds on previously successful efforts                      
              initiated over five years ago working on alloy phase stability.                
              As a result of these prior efforts, the researchers have                       
              identified the following areas of common interest and mutual                   
              benefit: phase equilibrium in magnetic alloys; surface phenomena               
              in close-packed structures; ordering phenomena in superconducting              
              ceramics; and thermodynamics of small metallic clusters.
