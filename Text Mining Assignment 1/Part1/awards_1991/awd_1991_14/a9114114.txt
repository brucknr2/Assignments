Ground vibrations generated by machine foundations or
              traffic can have an
adverse effect on nearby buildings, equipment, and people,
              ranging from
annoyance or discomfort to structural damage to the facilities.
              Therefore,
for prevention of damage to adjacent structures and equipment
              nearby, in
many cases it is necessary to significantly reduce the transmission
              of such
vibrations. For high frequency vibrations, this objective can be
              achieved by
placing a wave barrier between the source of vibration and the
              area to be
protected. In-filled concrete and soil-bentonite trenches have been
              used in
practice for many years as wave barriers.

The primary objective of
              the completed research was to conduct an
experimental investigation on the
              influence of various geometrical and
material parameters on vibration
              screening effectiveness of in-filled trench
barriers and then utilize the
              experimental data to verify and calibrate the
analytical findings. To achieve
              this objective prototyped model tests were
conducted in field in a remote area
              near the north campus of SUNY at
Buffalo. Both near field (active) and far
              field (passive) vibration
screening by concrete and soil-bentonite in-filled
              trenches were studied. An
electromagnetic vibratory oscillator was used as a
              vibration source to set
out continuous wave trains at selected frequencies.
              Measurements of ground
vibration at selected pickup points were made 'with'
              and 'without' the
in-filled barrier in place. The effectiveness of the
              barriers was computed
as the ratio of the ground motion 'with' and 'without'
              the barrier. These
results were then compared with analytical solutions.
              Detail of this
investigation has been presented in technical conferences, and
              will be
published in ASCE's Journal of Geotechnical Engineering.As a result of
              this
research, the present level of knowledge among engineers and scientists
              on
vibration screening by in-filled trenches will advance considerably.
