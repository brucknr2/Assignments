Abstract    :
              The object of this proposal is to explore the efficiency                       
              of a three-dimensional finite element implementation                           
              modeling of the consolidation process on a 386/486                             
              microcomputer. Such a model is urgently needed to support                      
              the recent developments in Automated Data Acquisition                          
              procedures, and to comprehend the delicate balance of the                      
              internal forces/mechanisms during the evolution of physical                    
              phenomena such as consolidation process that lead to soil                      
              instabilities.
