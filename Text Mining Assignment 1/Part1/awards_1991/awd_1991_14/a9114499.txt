Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many drugs are chiral, that is, they exist in right-and left-                  
              handed molecular forms called enantiomers.  Although structure                 
              is almost identical, enantiomers can differ considerably in                    
              their pharmacological effects.  For drug development, it is                    
              crucial to investigate the pharmacokinetics effects of                         
              individual pure enantiomers during preclinical and clinical                    
              trials.  However, the lack of sufficient quantities of                         
              individual stereoisomers drugs for carrying out these trials,                  
              and the expensive separation techniques for optical isomer                     
              resolution currently represent a bottleneck.  The objective of                 
              this project is to use a variety of newly discovered novel                     
              aqueous two-phase systems for the resolution of optical                        
              isomers.  Because the phase-forming compounds in these novel                   
              aqueous two-phase systems are relatively cheap, they will                      
              provide an inexpensive technique by which the chiral                           
              separation can be carried out.  In order to fully utilize                      
              their potential, a fundamental investigation of optical isomer                 
              partitioning in these new systems is done with the goal of                     
              enhancing the separation factor by varying environmental                       
              conditions.  This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research                    
              (SGER) jointly supported by the Separation and Purification                    
              and the Interfacial, Transport, and Thermodynamics Programs.
