Abstract    :
              Given the recent development in integrated optics                              
              and optoelectronics, it is important to develop                                
              computer-aided simulation, analysis and design                                 
              tools for the these device and systems.  A vectorial                           
              beam propagation method will be developed as                                   
              compared to the current scaler beam method where                               
              the polarization characteristics of the optical field                          
              are neglected.  The vectorial beam propagation                                 
              method VBPM to be developed will be applicable                                 
              to optical structures of arbitrary structural geometry                         
              and anisotropic media of arbitrary inhomogeneity.
