Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support collaborative research between Harold                  
              Hochman, Lafayette College, and Giorgio Brosio, University of                  
              Turin.  The objective of the project is to re-examine, using                   
              experimental methods, the basic behavioral hypotheses of the                   
              theory of bureaucracy and agency.  A unique aspect of this project             
              is its comparative nature.  The project will develop a better                  
              understanding of the objectives of local politicians and bureaucrats           
              and re-examine the extent of the principal-agent problem in                    
              decision-making in both local government and the not-for-profit                
              sector.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              At a positive level, the project will improve the understanding of             
              how market and non-market institutions translate the preferences of            
              constituents or sponsors, through fiscal and regulatory actions, into          
              agency decisions in government and in private organizations.  At a             
              normative level, the project will determine how well existing                  
              institutions perform this function and devise constraints or                   
              incentives systems to  help managers of public agencies and                    
              nonprofit organizations serve the interests of their principals.               
              Attention will initially be directed to three services -- cultural             
              activities, health and social services, and local transportation -- in         
              Turin and the Piedmont region in Italy, and in New York City,                  
              Pittsburgh, and other smaller cities in the northeastern United                
              States.  Researchers from Turin have developed and refined some                
              of the requisite methods of experimentation and interpretation that            
              complements those of the American specialists. There are enough                
              similarities and differences in fiscal and political responsibilities in       
              the two countries to define an excellent base for comparative                  
              analysis.
