Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to evaluate the static                       
              and dynamic interface strengths of the soil-geomembrane-                       
              geotextile interfaces found in typical liner systems. This                     
              objective will be accomplished by performing extensive                         
              torsional ring shear tests on the various liner interfaces.                    
              A ring shear apparatus will be used instead of a direct                        
              shear or pullout apparatus to allow for large continuous                       
              shear deformation in one direction, constant cross-                            
              sectional area during the test, thinner soil specimens                         
              permitting faster drainage and a residual strength in                          
              better agreement with field case histories.
