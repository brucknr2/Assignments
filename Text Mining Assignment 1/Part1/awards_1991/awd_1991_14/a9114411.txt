Abstract    :
              A combined theoretical/experimental study on the deformation                   
              behavior of high strength polymeric solids is proposed.  The                   
              mechanical testing machine capable of exerting uniaxial as well                
              as biaxial loading paths with controlled loading rates.  The                   
              time-dependent behavior manifested by creep, relaxation and rate               
              sensitivity is of great interest here.  Initially we want to                   
              complete a uniaxial study of high strength nylon and concurrent                
              microstructural investigations such as x-ray diffraction studies.              
              A fixture to accommodate tubular specimens subjected to axial,                 
              torsional and internal pressure loading will be designed and                   
              built.  Then a new test material will be chosen, preferably from               
              the class of polymeric, anisotropic, liquid crystals such as                   
              Xydar or Vectra, on which uniaxial and biaxial testing and                     
              microstructural investigations are contemplated.  In the                       
              theoretical part we propose to model the finite mechanical                     
              deformation behavior using state variable theories consisting of               
              coupled nonlinear differential equations.  The aim of the                      
              research is to combine synergistically phenomenological                        
              experiments, microstructural investigations and continuum                      
              mechanics to arrive at a mathematical model of the polymeric                   
              solid.
