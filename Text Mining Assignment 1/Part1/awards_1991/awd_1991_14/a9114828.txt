Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A comprehensive mesoscale four-dimensional data assimilation              
              (FDDA) and predictability study is proposed using the National                 
              Meteorological Center ETA model.  The PIs intend to continue FDDA              
              studies using the ETA model, assessing the performance of the                  
              assimilation system and examining the problem of mesoscale                     
              predictability.  In addition, the investigation will be extended to            
              the problem of profiler data assimilation in mesoscale models,                 
              including an assessment of the usefulness of the profiler network              
              in short range weather prediction.  Finally, as an outgrowth of                
              this study, the role of large-scale forcing, model resolution, and             
              model physics in the evolution of finer-scale features in a                    
              mesoscale model will be investigated.
