Abstract    :
              The Institute of Standards Research of ASTM will be                            
              conducting an interlaboratory testing program for rock                         
              properties. Specifically, funding is sought for purchasing,                    
              transporting, logging, cutting, coring and distributing                        
              samples of the rocks to be tested. The overall project                         
              objectives are: to obtain reliable estimates of precision                      
              of selected properties of rock to be incorporated into                         
              existing standards; identification of desirable                                
              modifications; and dissemination of information collected                      
              among parties of interest in industry, government and                          
              academe, and between producers and users.
