Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              RD Instruments proposes to complete Phase II of a research                     
              project under the Small Business Innovation Research program.                  
              The proposed research will lead to the development of an                       
              Accoustic Doppler Directional Wave Spectrum measurement system.                
              Phase I research successfully demonstrated the feasibility of                  
              using accoustic doppler techniques to measure directional wave                 
              spectra (DWS).  The proposed research will focus on efforts to                 
              measure DWS from an upward_looking Accoustic Doppler Current                   
              Profiler (ADCP) with standard 4-beam Janus transducer                          
              configuration that will be mounted on a stable platform in depths              
              of up to 100 meters.
