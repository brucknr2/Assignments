Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) has moved into            
              its operational phase subsequent to the approval of the IGBP                   
              initial core projects by the International Council of Scientific               
              Unions in Paris in August 1990.  The program consists of a number              
              of core projects addressing different components of the total earth            
              including oceans, atmosphere, and land, and their linkages through             
              the climate and biogeochemical systems.                                        
                                                                                             
              This project establishes an office for coordinating international              
              efforts of Focus 1 (ecosystem physiology) of the IGBP core project             
              on Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems.  The project office               
              will include a project coordinator and secretarial assistance.
