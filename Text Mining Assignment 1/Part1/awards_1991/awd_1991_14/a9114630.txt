Abstract    :
              The research objective is to develop fundamental insight,                      
              including explicit control design procedures, for control of                   
              mechanical systems subject to nonholonomic constraints (i.e.,                  
              systems characterized by rolling without slipping).  It has been               
              demonstrated that suitable control cannot be achieved using                    
              classical nonlinear control methodologies, and this project's                  
              intent is to develop methods which are consistent with this class              
              of dynamics problems.  These methods involve mathematical                      
              concepts from differential geometry.  Strong motivation is                     
              provided for this research by several important classes of                     
              engineering control problems, including several classes of                     
              problems with aerospace applications.***  //
