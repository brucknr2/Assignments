Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The main objective of this Dissertation Improvement proposal is                
              to clarify the forces affecting the fate of an animal's remains;               
              its taphonomy.  By so doing, one is able to better interpret the               
              collections of remains which have survived to be discovered as                 
              fossils.  Remains of animals inhabiting different habitats are                 
              subject to different physical, chemical and biotic forces. Here,               
              the investigators will conduct subaerial excavations in varying                
              ecological zones in Mahale Mountain National Park in Tanzania. An              
              inventory of bones, as to taxon, completeness, age group, degree               
              of damage due to the action of carnivores and/or scavengers and                
              other variables will be assembled.  Comparisons across habitats                
              should provide useful information about ancestral hominid                      
              species.  This is a particularly useful study site as there                    
              already is much known about the behavior of mammals, particularly              
              primates, in the area.  Additional there are a variety of habitat              
              types contained within a small geographic area.
