Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this project is to evaluate the utility of                 
              the Bureau of Labor Statistics' universe file as a sampling frame              
              for National Science Foundation's surveys concerned with R&D                   
              expenditures, primarily in the industrial sector.                              
                   The Bureau of Labor Statistics will develop several reports               
              that analyze R&d information in the universe file and the                      
              Occupational Employment Statistics master file. Information will               
              be provided at both the two and four digit Standard Industrial                 
              Classification levels, with stratification by size of firm and                 
              other variables.
