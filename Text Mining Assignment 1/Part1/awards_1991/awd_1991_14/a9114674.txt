Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop and integrate                     
              the perception, planning, and manipulation technologies                        
              necessary for autonomously detecting, uncovering, and                          
              retrieving fragile buried objects. Such technology has                         
              application in the retrieval of waste containers from                          
              landfills, recovery of munitions from shallow burial,                          
              exposure of cables beneath the ocean floor, and acquisition                    
              of extraterrestrial soil/rock samples. The proposed work                       
              will advance current knowledge in the fields of software                       
              architectures and reasoning systems for autonomous robots                      
              working with geomaterials, perception for building three-                      
              dimensional representations of buried objects, and                             
              manipulation for extricating objects from geo or diffuse                       
              material.
