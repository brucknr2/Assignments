Abstract    :
              We purpose a two year collaborative project at the                             
              US Army Electronic Technology and Devices                                      
              Laboratory (ETDL), Fort Monmouth.  The                                         
              program will support one PhD Student who will                                  
              carry out experiment at SUNY as well as at ETDL.                               
              Work will include study of electron delocalization in                          
              GaAs/A1As quantum wells via the A1As X Band                                    
              minimum.
