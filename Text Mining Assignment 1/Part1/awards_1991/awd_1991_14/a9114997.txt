Abstract    :
              This proposal presents a novel solution to the multilayer neural               
              network training problem - determining the connection weights of               
              the neurons - using a very powerful construct from combinatorial               
              geometry called a Voronoi diagram.  It will also address the                   
              equally important problem of how to partition a neural network into            
              smaller subnetworks which can then be used either individually or              
              together to approximate the function of the original network.
