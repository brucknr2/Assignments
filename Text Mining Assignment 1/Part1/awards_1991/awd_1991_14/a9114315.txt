Abstract    :
                   This research examines the contributions of task cues                     
              and dominance cues to the attainment of status in groups.                      
              Results of the Phase I Small Business Innovation Research                      
              (SBIR) study indicate that females may gain influence in                       
              mixed-sex task groups by enacting high task behaviors, but                     
              that dominance behavior is an ineffective and poorly received                  
              strategy.  However, although research indicates a strong                       
              negative group reaction to dominance attempts, it is not                       
              understood why this occurs.  Furthermore, given that there                     
              are numerous instances in the applied work world in which                      
              females as well as males must direct others through implied                    
              threat, it is important to examine conditions under which                      
              dominance behaviors may be exhibited without negative                          
              sanction.  The overall goals of the Phase II SBIR research                     
              are:  (1) to understand the basis of the normative reactions                   
              to dominance attempts, and (2) to examine strategies to                        
              overcome these effects, especially attempts by females and                     
              other low status individuals to to direct others in task                       
              group environments.
