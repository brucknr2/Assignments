Abstract    :
              Research will be conducted to provide reliable methods of analysis             
              of composite materials containing either spherical or elongated                
              spheroidal inhomogeneities at arbitrarily high volume fractions.               
              A given ensemble of inhomogeneities will be analyzed directly.                 
              This will allow for an accurate prediction of the overall response             
              of these materials, and also for an examination of how their                   
              properties depend upon the internal distribution of inhomogeneities            
              and the local stress concentrations.
