              This award supports visits by Professors                                       
              Joseph S. Francisco of Wayne State University                                  
              and Jeffrey I. Steinfeld of M.I.T., along with                                 
              graduate students, to Griffith University,                                     
              Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, to work with                                  
              Professors Alan E.W. Knight, Keith D. King of

              spectroscopy and dynamics of halocarbon                                        
              degradation processes.  The reactions of                                       
              simple silicon-containing molecules are of key                                 
              importance in understanding deposition and                                     
              etching processes taking place at silicon                                      
              surfaces, which are widely used in electronics                                 
              and photovoltaic technology.  In this                                          
              cooperative research program, the                                              
              complementary experimental and technical                                       
              expertise of three university research                                         
              laboratories in the U.S. and Australia has                                     
              been brought to bear on elucidating this                                       
              problem.  With support from the U.S.-Australia                                 
              Cooperative Program, graduate students were                                    
              exchanged for three- to six-month periods                                      
              between the research groups involved, and a                                    
              three-day symposium, including the principal                                   
              investigators and junior research personnel,                                   
              took place in June 1990.  A workshop on "Laser                                 
              Applications in Molecular Dynamics and                                         
              Molecular Structure Analyses" held at Byron                                    
              Bay, N.S.W., on 1-4 June 1990, included                                        
              presentations by fifteen participants from the                                 
              U.S. and Australian groups.
