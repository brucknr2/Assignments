Abstract    :
                   This award is in the joint ENG/CISE research thrust in                    
              Intelligent Material Handling Systems.  Its objective is to develop            
              an integrated procedure for the implementation of a stockless                  
              system by hospitals for a more cost efficient material management              
              program.  Given the scope of a stockless system, the research aims             
              to integrate the entire distribution pipeline, from medical supply             
              distributors to supply stations at Nurses Stations at hospitals and            
              will address engineering and operational issues throughout the                 
              pipeline.                                                                      
                   The project will investigate organizational, operational, and             
              engineering needs that must be instituted both at hospitals and                
              supplier distribution centers to operate a successful stockless                
              system.  This includes hardware designs for material packaging and             
              containerization at warehouses, material supply stations at Nurses             
              Stations, and the use of such hardware for material dispensing to              
              patients from Nurses Stations.  Accurate information exchange is               
              crucial to the success of a stockless system.  The procedures also             
              include material location, packaging/palletizing, and order                    
              retrieval.  Therefore, the project will also address equipment                 
              requirements and develop techniques for warehouse layout and order             
              picking which impact the distribution system.
