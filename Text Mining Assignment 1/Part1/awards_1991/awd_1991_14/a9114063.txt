Abstract    :
              This award will support a joint U.S.-Mexico workshop                           
              in numerical analysis to be held in Oaxaca, Mexico                             
              in January 1992.  Organized by Professor Richard                               
              Tapia of Rice University and Professor Jean Pierre                             
              Hennart of the Institute for Applied Mathematics                               
              (IIMAS) at the Universidad Autonoma de Mexico                                  
              (UNAM), the workshop will emphasize numerical                                  
              optimization, numerical linear algebra, and the                                
              numerical solution of ordinary and partial                                     
              differential equations.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This workshop is sixth in a series of  U.S.-Mexico                             
              workshops in numerical analysis that have taken                                
              place since 1978.  As such, these workshops have                               
              been very valuable in helping to sustain  the                                  
              exchange of ideas and knowledge between outstanding                            
              researchers on both sides of the border.  Moreover,                            
              the workshop topics are likely to be of increasing                             
              importance in future U.S.-Mexico scientific and                                
              technological exchanges.
