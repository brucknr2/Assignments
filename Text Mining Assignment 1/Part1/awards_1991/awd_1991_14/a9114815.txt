Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research aims to                              
              study chaos in electromagnetic systems.  During this                           
              1-year experimental research program, we seek to                               
              establish the important principles governing                                   
              electromagnetic chaos via specific experiments on:  1)                         
              Wavefunctions of chaotic microwave cavities, such s                            
              the Sinai billiard and the stadium.  In particular,                            
              detailed information regarding the spatial distribution                        
              of the wavefunctions will be obtained using novel                              
              experimental techniques.  2) Spectral statistic of                             
              resonant mode frequencies of chaotic and regular                               
              cavities.  3)  Scattering properties of chaotic systems,                       
              such as the three disk.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The work is expected to impact on                                              
              telecommunications, since the concepts of chaos will                           
              be introduced to electromagnetic systems for the first                         
              time.  The program will borrow from and impact                                 
              upon fundamental ideas in quantum chaos, eg.                                   
              scarred eigenstates, eigenvalue spacing distributions,                         
              etc.  In addition, the results can be scaled to                                
              correspond to experiments on quantum mesoscopic                                
              systems.
