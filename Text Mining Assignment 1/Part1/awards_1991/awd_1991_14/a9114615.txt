Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the load-duration effect of wood                 
              structures by studying the condition of the members of an 85 year              
              salvaged roof truss.  Using load-duration models of damage                     
              accumulation, the mechanical properties of the members will be                 
              predicted and compared with the experimental data.
