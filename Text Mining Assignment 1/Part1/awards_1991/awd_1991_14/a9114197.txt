Abstract    :
                Real-time database systems are needed in many important                      
              applications such as program trading in the stock market,                      
              telecommunications, computer integrated manufacturing, advanced                
              process control, intelligent highway systems, and various                      
              multimedia applications.  Most current real-time database                      
              technology consists of fairly simple extensions to basic database              
              protocols and is only applicable to soft real-time applications.               
              This work extends real-time database technology to more                        
              sophisticated levels by utilizing  an abstract data type model,                
              nested transactions, distributed systems, and both soft and  hard              
              real-time constraints. The work compares the use of an active                  
              database paradigm with the more traditional approach. Integrated               
              solutions across concurrency control, commit protocols, cpu                    
              scheduling, I/O, deadlock resolution, and communication are                    
              stressed.  The research approach is largely experimental and uses              
              testbeds built with prior NSF awards. Results from this project can            
              create more efficient, profitable, and safer real-time database                
              applications.
