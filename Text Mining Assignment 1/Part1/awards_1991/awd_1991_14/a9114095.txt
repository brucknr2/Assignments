Abstract    :
              This proposal outlines a new approach to developing software for               
              project management that is expected to offer a wide range of                   
              improvements to both the software development process and the                  
              characteristics of the resulting applications.  The overall                    
              objectives are to construct systems that offer greater flexibility,            
              higher intelligence, and significantly better integration.  The                
              proposed approach does not replace either traditional project                  
              management application or advanced application such as expert                  
              systems; rather, it offers a more efficient and uniform methodology            
              for implementing these programs and a new integrated environment               
              in which these application can reside.  The basic approach of the              
              proposed research which relies heavily on the concepts of object-              
              oriented programming, is to create a set of standardized software              
              objects that represent the fundamental elements of the project                 
              management process.  For example, objects would be created to                  
              represent a building's physical components (e.g., beams and                    
              columns), the basic construction activities needed to produce these            
              physical components, and the resources required to perform the                 
              activities.  These basic "building block" objects could then be                
              pieced together , according to general design and development                  
              guidelines, to form the core of various project management                     
              application programs.
