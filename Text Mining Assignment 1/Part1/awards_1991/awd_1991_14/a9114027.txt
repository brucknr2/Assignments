Abstract    :
                   To display complicated information, a common instinct is to               
              draw a picture that is equally complicated.  Yet, minimizing                   
              distraction by details is the goal.  Translating natural and                   
              effective renderings of unembellished important structures to                  
              computer presentation is conceptually and practically a very                   
              difficult problem.  Two basic ideas underlie the approach here:                
              First, depicting several views and then drawing the links to                   
              identify the same object in the several views gives a sense of                 
              the position of the object vis a vis others even in many                       
              dimensions.                                                                    
                   Second, taking natural groupings of objects and examining                 
              their interrelationships allows focusing on the finer structure                
              of the group.  From these two basic principles, a conceptually                 
              coherent approach to viewing multidimensional data can be                      
              derived.  Then actual methodology based on focusing and linking                
              can be developed; user interface architectures to make efficient               
              use of these techniques can be tried and prototypes can be                     
              implemented.
