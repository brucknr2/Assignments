Abstract    :
                   The proposed studies will continue research undertaken for                
              the China and America Air/Sea Experiments.  Aerosol particles                  
              collected through ground-based sampling are analyzed (1) to                    
              determine the natural and anthropogenic components of the                      
              airborne particulate material, (2) to investigate the temporal                 
              variability in atmospheric dust concentrations and the                         
              meteorological conditions responsible for the concentration                    
              differences, and (3) to estimate the atmospheric deposition rates              
              of mineral aerosol and selected trace elements to the waters                   
              bordering eastern Asia.  New initiatives will focus on the                     
              atmospheric transport of soils as it relates to global climatic                
              change, and the chemistry off contemporary aerosol particles will              
              be to compared and contrasted with that of loess from China.  The              
              morphology and chemistry of individual aerosol particles will be               
              investigated through the use of a scanning electron microscope                 
              equipped with a microanalyzer, and these data will be compared                 
              with the mass-particle size distributions obtained with cascade                
              impactors.  Selected loess and aerosol samples will be analyzed                
              using x-ray diffractometry for confirmation of the individual                  
              particle analyses and for comparative mineralogical studies.                   
              Finally, the chemical data for the individual particles will be                
              used to evaluate certain chemical reactions between the mineral                
              dust and anthropogenic substances.
