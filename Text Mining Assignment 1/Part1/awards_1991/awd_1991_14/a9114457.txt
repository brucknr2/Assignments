Abstract    :
              The construction and operation of new large telescopes both                    
              on the ground and in space requires the measurement of the                     
              brightness and colors for a sequence of faint stars distributed                
              across the sky. In this two-year study the author will continue                
              previous work extending a list of faint "photometric standards"                
              in both hemispheres to the magnitude range 10-21. It is expected               
              that this and companion work will address many needs of astronomy              
              requiring observations of faint stars and galaxies.  In addition,              
              this project will contribute to a database in which standard                   
              photometry conducted with a photomultiplier will be compared                   
              with photometry obtained with "CCDs" (Charge Coupled Devices).
