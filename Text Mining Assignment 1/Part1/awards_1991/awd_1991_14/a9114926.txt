Abstract    :
                   Dr. Allan Muth is Director of the P. L. Boyd Deep Canyon                  
              Research Center.  The Center is part of the University of                      
              California Natural Reserve System, and is administered by the                  
              University of California at Riverside.  The Center is adjacent to              
              the San Bernadino National Forest and encompasses habitats ranging             
              from desert canyon floor below sealevel to Upper Sonoran life                  
              zones.  Dr. Muth proposes construction of a residence for visiting             
              scientists, drilling a water well for the Station, renovation of               
              an existing building into several labs, and acquisition of basic               
              lab equipment for the renovated labs.                                          
                   The proposed construction and renovation will increase the                
              research productivity of the Center, and will facilitate more in-              
              depth studies of desert ecology and physiological adaptations to               
              heat and water stress.  Research on these topics is especially                 
              important for management and conservation of the fragile desert                
              environment, and for a better understanding of the effects of                  
              global climate change.
