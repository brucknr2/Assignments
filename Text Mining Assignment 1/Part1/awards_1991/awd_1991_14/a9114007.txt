Abstract    :
                The proposed project is intended to provide early research                   
              experience and other university associations to academically                   
              qualified African American, Hispanic, and Native American                      
              students to encourage their participation in professional                      
              careers in the physical and mathematical sciences, especially                  
              through attainment of advanced degrees.  The research                          
              experience will be provided in faculty laboratories where                      
              research in areas of astronomy, chemistry, geology,                            
              mathematics (including computer science), and physics is                       
              being performed.                                                               
                The program is designed to provide continuous (academic                      
              year, ten hours per week; summer, 40 hours per week for eight                  
              weeks) research and faculty mentor exposure through the                        
              students' junior and senior year and possibly the first year                   
              of a graduate program.  This project design permits continued                  
              contact and reinforcement of degree and career objectives for                  
              the student.  Both summer and academic year (AY) activities                    
              will include weekly (summer) and biweekly (AY) interactive                     
              colloquia that will include student reports of their research                  
              activities to the group and discussions of topics of broad                     
              application, such as career objectives, ethics in science, and                 
              computer applications to science problem solving.  Career                      
              perspectives and student social interactions will be enhanced                  
              by including (AY colloquia) students of the "Minority Access                   
              to Energy-Related Careers" program, in which student summer                    
              research is conducted in DOE laboratories in the western                       
              states.
