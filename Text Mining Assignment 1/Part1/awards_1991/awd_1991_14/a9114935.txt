Abstract    :
              Supernovae are important in astronomy both because they are a                  
              key phase in the evolution of stars and because they produce                   
              energy and enriched chemical elements to the interstellar                      
              gas from which new generations of stars form.  To understand                   
              the physical mechanism involved requires a knowledge of how                    
              supernova evolve after they fade from the initial brilliance of                
              their explosions to faint knots and filaments of their remnants at             
              large distances from their origins.  The Principal Investigator                
              (PI) will continue a spectroscopic survey to discovery of supernova            
              remnants primarily in the Magellanic Clouds and the external galaxy            
              M33 to find new remnants.  He will also take "photographs" of known            
              remnants with a charged coupled device (CCD) detector combined with            
              filters appropriate to emission lines of ions that permit an                   
              analysis of the remnant's chemical abundances, motions, and thermal            
              characteristics.  The PI has taken a lead in the past in involving             
              undergraduates in the studies of these kinematic images.  This                 
              proposal is expected to provide a dual purpose, both in elucidating            
              the evolution of supernovae centuries after their explosions and               
              in the instruction of students in the techniques of extracting                 
              information from multiple exposure images.
