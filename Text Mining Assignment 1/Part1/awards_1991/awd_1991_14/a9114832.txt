Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves a series of analytical experiments aimed at              
              determining the major-element and important minor-element                      
              concentrations within selected fluid inclusions in a variety of                
              oceanic rock samples.  Both conventional methods (microscope                   
              heating/freezing experiments) and new methods (synchrotorn-source              
              x-ray fluorescence) will be used.  These analyses will enable well-            
              constrained pressure-volume-temperature modeling and thermodynamic             
              modeling of oceanic rock-fluid systems.
