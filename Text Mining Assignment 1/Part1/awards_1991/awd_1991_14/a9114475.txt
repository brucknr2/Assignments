Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is to integrate simulation,                
              learning, and optimization to form an Adaptive and Interactive                 
              Modeling System (AIMS) to support multiple perspectives at                     
              different stages for design and concurrent engineering.  Given a               
              database of examples collected from simulations or experiments, and            
              a set of modeling objectives and design objectives, AIMS performs              
              multi-objective optimization at both model formation and                       
              utilization phases.  By varying modeling objectives, such as speed,            
              accuracy, and comprehensibility, AIMS can produce layered models               
              to meet the changing needs at different stages of design.                      
                   By treating different life-cycle concerns as competing design             
              objectives, AIMS can support systematic incorporation of multiple              
              perspectives for concurrent engineering.  This research represents             
              a significant and meaningful integration between artificial                    
              intelligence based techniques and conventional engineering methods             
              to further advance the basic research in design automation.
