Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports a workshop for Historically Black Colleges               
              and Universities (HBCU's) Smart Node consultants to the Cornell                
              National Supercomputer Facility (CNSF).  The CNSF Smart Node                   
              program is a consortium of more than 70 institutions nationwide                
              that distribute supercomputing expertise, support and training to              
              researchers and students at their home institution.  The primary               
              goals of the program are to provide readily available consulting               
              and training for researcher who access the CNSF's facilities from              
              remote institutions and to involve participating institutions in               
              the development of programs that address their supercomputing                  
              needs. These goals are met through the combined efforts of the                 
              Theory Center Staff, the CNSF and the Smart Node institutions.                 
              This project includes an initial training workshop and support for             
              one of the annual Smart Node consultants meetings.  There will also            
              be special regional meetings at several of the HBCU institutions.              
              COntacts between the HBCU's and members of the Theory Center's                 
              Corporate Research Institute and its industrial partners will be               
              initiated for the development of student internships and to                    
              stimulate interactions with faculty.
