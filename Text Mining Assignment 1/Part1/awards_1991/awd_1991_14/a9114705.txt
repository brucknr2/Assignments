Abstract    :
              Atomic transition probabilities are an essential ingredient in the             
              quantitative analysis of the strengths of lines in stellar spectra.            
              The Principal Investigator (PI) has devoted his career to the                  
              improved measurement of atomic parameters for their use by                     
              laboratory physicists and astronomers.  In this two-year award, the            
              PI plans to use an inductively coupled argon plasma, which enabled             
              him to obtain transition probabilities to accuracies of 5-25% for              
              iron and molybdenum in recent NSF-support research.  In this                   
              program the PI will extend these techniques to a thousand                      
              transitions of neutral and once-ionized titanium ions.  These                  
              studies will also form the basis for research theses of two                    
              undergraduate students.
