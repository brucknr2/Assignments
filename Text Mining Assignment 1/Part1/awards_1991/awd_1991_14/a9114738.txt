Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI has invented and patented a process for making a new                    
              class of polymeric materials which he calls microcellular                      
              plastics.  The process consists of the formation of a                          
              gas/polymer solution and the inducement of its thermodynamic                   
              instability to nucleate a very large number (1015 cells/cm3)                   
              of microbubbles or cells which are on the order of 10-6m in                    
              diameter.  These cells are smaller than the flaws that                         
              preexist within polymers and thus do not compromise the                        
              polymer's specific mechanical properties.  This can be done at                 
              room temperature as well as at higher temperatures.  The                       
              technology has been further developed and commercialized by                    
              industry.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The goals of the proposed research are to determine the                        
              fundamental mechanisms of super gas concentration in polymers                  
              and to develop a new class of materials, which the PI is                       
              calling ultra-microcellular plastics, which are characterized                  
              by cell sizes on the order of 10-7m in diameter and cell                       
              densities of the order of 1018 cells/cm3 of parent material.                   
              Understanding the physical phenomena governing super gas                       
              concentration in polymers can be used to affect the                            
              performance-structure-property-processing relationship of                      
              these materials and help design procedures to manufacture the                  
              new, even more densely packed foams that the PI is planning to                 
              produce.  Ultra-microcellular plastics have potential                          
              advantages over the parent material and over other foams such                  
              as transparency, high-impact strength, increased strength-to-                  
              weight ratio, and improved thermal and dielectric properties.                  
              On a broader scale, understanding the fundamental phenomena                    
              involved in the synthesis of these materials could be used to                  
              develop industrial technologies for example for                                
              environmentally-safe foaming technologies, filters, optical                    
              materials, insulation materials, and substrates for                            
              photographic films.
