Abstract    :
              In this project of the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                 
              Program of the Chemistry Division, Lin will use density matrix                 
              techniques in a theoretical investigation of ultrafast                         
              photochemical and photophysical processes.  The work will be                   
              coordinated with that of experimental groups working on                        
              time-resolved femtosecond infrared spectroscopy and Raman                      
              scattering.  Studies will deal with the spectroscopy and                       
              dynamics of F-aggregate centers and ultrafast biological                       
              electron transfer.

              Modern laser technology has made it possible to investigate the                
              rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions at the level of                     
              individual electron transfer steps.  In this project, Lin seeks                
              to provide the theoretical analysis needed to quantify such                    
              experiments including the primary electron transfer step in                    
              photosynthetic reaction centers.
