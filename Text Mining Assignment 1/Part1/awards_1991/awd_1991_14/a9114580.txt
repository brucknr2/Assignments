Abstract    :
              The objective of this U.S.-Yugoslav workshop in earthquake                     
              engineering between Helmut Krawinkler of Stanford University and               
              Peter Fajfar of the University of Ljubljana is to identify                     
              cooperative research projects on nonlinear seismic analysis of                 
              reinforced concrete buildings.  The main topics for study are                  
              mathematical modeling of earthquake-resistant structured walls and             
              energy response in aseismic analysis and design of buildings.  The             
              workshop will also address repair and strengthening of existing                
              structures and buildings.  A total of ten U.S. scientists from                 
              universities and the National Institute for Standards and Technology           
              and 10 Yugoslav scientists from 6 Yugoslav republics will                      
              participate.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This project is supported by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                  
              Cooperation in Science and Technology through a joint fund                     
              consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav                
              governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the                
              Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.
