Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks the partial support of ICCG-10 and ISSCG-8,                
              which will be held in San Diego and Palm Springs, CA, respectively.            
              The former will be held from August 16th to 22nd, and the latter               
              will be held from August 9th to 14th of 1992.  The conference will             
              examine all aspect of bulk and thin film crystal growth, with                  
              particular emphasis placed on:  (1) melt and solution growth of                
              bulk crystals; (2) thin films and epitaxial  growth by MOCVD and               
              MBE; (3) crystal compounds including electro-optic materials and               
              superconductors; (4) the theory of crystal growth; (5) crystal                 
              growth in microgravity envirenment; (6) novel growth techniques;               
              and (7) advanced materials, such as fullerenes, light emitting                 
              silicon structures, and others.

              Both the Summer School and the International Conference are the                
              major events organized by and for the crystal growth scientific and            
              technology community of the world.  As such, they are truly                    
              international, as they are organized and planned by the                        
              international planning board.  In 1992, it is the U.S. who will act            
              as the host country.  Both the Summer School and the International             
              Conference have plans to publich their proceedings.  Proceedings of            
              this series have been valuable literature in the field of crystal              
              growth.
