Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award, to one of the leading young woman observational                    
              astronomers, is for studies of star formation efficiencies in young            
              spiral galaxies.  State of the art instrumentation will be used to             
              make observations of the distribution of ionized and molecular gas             
              in nearby galaxies, to measure radical gradients in interstellar               
              gas in molecular form.  These investigations will help to clarify              
              our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.
