Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Using newly digitized rapid-run ionosondes, together with WORM                 
              drive digital recorders, it is proposed to build a new data base               
              of observations at an existing close-spaced triangulation network              
              at L  4.5 in western Quebec.  From this data base, continuous TID              
              parameters are to be deduced, including the vertical phase                     
              propagation constants of the causative gravity waves.  Combining               
              the vertical and horizontal components, the 3-dimensional                      
              orientations of the gravity-wave wave-fronts can be obtained and               
              the source locations inferred.                                                 
                                                                                             
              In the second year, it is proposed to extend the data base by                  
              simultaneously operating a second, existing, close-spaced                      
              triangulation network at L  3.3, 1000 km south of the northern                 
              network.  Analysis of these simultaneous data sets is expected to              
              cast additional light on the source of the causative gravity                   
              waves and on their propagation.
