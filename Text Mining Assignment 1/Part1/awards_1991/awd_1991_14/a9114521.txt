Abstract    :
              This project addresses research in walking machine design.                     
              Specifically, the primary objective here is to test the                        
              feasibility of a walking machine design based on some                          
              characteristics of arthropod legs.  Arthropods are chosen for the              
              animal model to be emulated because of their similarity to                     
              current engineering capabilities for building walking machines.                
              Three important characteristics of insect legs are: 1) a point                 
              contact with the ground, 2) a near approximation to a Hooke joint              
              for connection to the body, and 3) a single revolute joint near                
              the middle of the leg which changes distance from the ground                   
              contact to the Hooke joint.  This structure encourages the                     
              speculation that when all six feet contact the ground, the legs                
              exert only forces (no torques) on the body.  When fewer feet are               
              on the ground, the simplest way to walk appears to be staying at               
              or near balance positions.  A walking machine based on these                   
              concepts is proposed.  This walking machine design is                          
              dramatically different from current designs, and keeps the                     
              machine statically stable and statically determinant as much of                
              the time as possible.  When this is possible, simple control                   
              schemes can be used to maintain balance.
