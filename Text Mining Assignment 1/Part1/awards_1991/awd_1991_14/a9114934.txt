Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is concerned with the synthesis and characterization             
              of solid-states, transition-metal compound having S, Se, or Te.                
              The ultimate goal is to make the chemistry of solid-state material             
              more predictable.   The chemistry of the proposed compounds is                 
              fundamentally different from that of the oxides.  Characterization             
              of the new materials will involve structure determination by                   
              single-crystal x-ray method, measurement of transport properties               
              such as electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility, and               
              approximate electronic calculation for simple structures.  Three               
              major areas are studied:  1) oxyselenides and oxysulfides, 2) Nb or            
              Ta/ transition metal/Te systems, and the reactive flux technique               
              for the synthesis of new ternary and quaternary solid-state                    
              compound.
