Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on the physical properties              
              of strongly correlated quantum liquids.  In particular, work will              
              be done on experimental implications of the chiral spin states and             
              other spin liquid states;  edge states and the topological order in            
              the fractional quantum Hall states; and, strongly correlated metals            
              in quasi-one-dimensional systems and quasi-two-dimensional systems.            
              The theoretical approach will utilize field theoretic methods.                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Recent advances in condensed matter theory have emphasized the                 
              unity of strongly interacting many-body systems in spatial                     
              dimensions less than three.  Of noteworthy importance is the study             
              of the fractional quantum Hall effect and high temperature                     
              superconductors using the concept of fractional statistics in two-             
              dimensions to describe a unique and new state of matter.  This                 
              grant will support research on the connections between various                 
              strongly interacting condensed matter systems using the theoretical            
              formalism developed for high energy physics.
