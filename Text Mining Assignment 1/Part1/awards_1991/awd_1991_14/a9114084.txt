Abstract    :
                   This project initiates the first year of a five-year                      
              continuing award to Florida Atlantic University to join with the               
              University of Arkansas and the University of Cincinnati in merging             
              with Georgia Institute of Technology's Industry/University                     
              Cooperative Research Center for Material Handling.                             
                   The university has developed the company support to be added              
              to the Center's industry base.  The research projects approved by              
              the new consolidated Industry Advisory Board are "Carton Design                
              Intelligent Systems", "Container Inventory Reduction in                        
              Distribution Systems", and "Modeling and Analysis of Printed                   
              Circuit Board Manufacturing."                                                  
                   The researchers are experts in their fields and have the                  
              capability and facilities to participate in the new merged Center.             
                   The Program Manager recommends Florida Atlantic University be             
              awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.            
                   Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                  
              and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review            
              the progress of the center on a number of criteria, including the              
              following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                    
              interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to                 
              which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                 
              robust research program is developing.  If the review is                       
              satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend support of the               
              next period of this continuing grant.
