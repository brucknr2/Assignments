Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the dissertation research of a graduate                    
              student in cultural anthropology who will study changing gender                
              relations in a pastoralist area of east Africa.  The research                  
              will analyze how changing local conceptions of social and                      
              economic class and age affect gender relations in an overall                   
              situation of fairly rapid and significant socio-economic                       
              development.  Most studies on this question have shown that                    
              development policies are slanted in favor of men, and result in                
              decreases in the standard of living of women and children                      
              relative to changes for men.  This project will look at these                  
              relationships in more detail.  The design is to compare three                  
              villages varying on dimensions of development and income, using a              
              combination of intensive ethnography, formal surveys, and                      
              analysis of historical documents.  The student has lived in this               
              area before for several years, and has the necessary linguistic                
              skills, social and political contacts to carry the research out.               
                                                                                             
              This research is important because gender relations in economic                
              development schemes have become a major focus of attention in                  
              recent years.  This detailed case study will provide material of               
              value to policy makers so that new projects can be designed that               
              benefit women (and the children who are in their care) as well as              
              men.
