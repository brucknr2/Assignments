Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              FARNET, Inc., through NYSERNet, Inc., proposes a two-day workshop              
              in August 1991 to examine the future of the present regional                   
              networking model, which is a three-level hierarchy including                   
              campuses, midlevel networks, and a national backbone.  The goal                
              is to develop a consensus among the midlevel networks about the                
              optimum plan for inter-regional connectivity after the                         
              termination of the current NSFNET backbone agreement in November
