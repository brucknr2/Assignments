Abstract    :
              Microcellular thermoplastics are novel materials containing a large            
              number of closed cells, typically 106/cm3 or more, of order 10                 
              microns in diameter.  Such a microstructure allows a significant               
              reduction in density without compromising the essential mechanical             
              properties. Recently remarkable new materials have been produced               
              from polycarbonate and from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), using            
              carbon dioxide as the nucleating gas.  In PET, high concentrations             
              of carbon dioxide have been found to crystallize PET, enabling                 
              creation of cellular composites with an integral, crystalline skin.            
                                                                                             
              In polycarbonate, bubble densities of 5 billion/cm3 or more have               
              been achieved, allowing for creation of microcellular foams with               
              a wide range of properties.                                                    
                                                                                             
              In this research a detailed characterization of the CO-2                       
              polycarbonate and CO2-PET material systems will be carried out.                
              The CO2-induced crystallization in PET, molecular orientation in               
              cell walls, and the cell morphology will be studies.  Bubble                   
              nucleation phenomena in both PET and polycarbonate will be                     
              experimentally characterized.  Also the mechanical behavior of                 
              microcellular composites will be measured and related to the                   
              microstructure via a theoretical model.
