Abstract    :
              This research has as its objectives, advances in understanding and             
              analysis of large plastic deformation of crystalline materials and             
              improvements in predictive capability of bi-crystal and crystalline            
              aggregate models.  Two principal lines of investigation are                    
              planned: (1) analysis of texture formation in f.c.c. crystalline               
              aggregates using experimentally-based hardening rules, including               
              application of the theory of minimum plastic spin to resolve the               
              long-standing non-uniqueness problem in rate-independent, uniform              
              distortion models; and (2) detailed analysis of nonuniform shearing            
              and lattice rotation in bi-crystals in the channel die compression             
              test, again making use of minimum plastic spin and including                   
              comparison with experimental observations and data.  In addition,              
              studies will be initiated for the development of improved                      
              crystalline slip constitutive equations, well-founded in                       
              experiment, that include rate-dependent as well as deformation-                
              dependent elastic ranges.  Successful accomplishment of these                  
              interrelated investigations would substantially contribute to                  
              greater understanding of and accurate predictive capabilities for              
              finite distortion and texture evolution in metal polycrystals and              
              aggregates.
