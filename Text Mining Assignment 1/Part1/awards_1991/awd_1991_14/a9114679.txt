Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Researchers have developed sophisticated reliability-based bridge              
              rating procedures to combat the severity of infrastructure                     
              condition.  the objective of this study is to develop a computer               
              tool to transfer this bridge rating technology to practicing                   
              engineers and to provide guidance on how to use this technology.               
              the computer-sided evaluation package would (1) aid the engineer               
              in making sound judgement for bridge modeling, (2) perform the                 
              various rating analyses, (3) provide guidance through the rating               
              process, and (4) interpret the results of standard in microcomputer            
              application user-interfaces.  The analysis routines will range from            
              the simple standard AASHTO procedures to a full-system inelastic               
              limit state analysis.  A contest-sensitive hypertext system will               
              be used to train and guide the engineer throughout the rating                  
              process.  The impact of the system could be enormous given the                 
              limited computational facilities of most highway departments.  It              
              would be an efficient and rational tool to use to evaluate the                 
              safety of the nation's bridges.
