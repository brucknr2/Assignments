Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a continuation of the work on the nannoplankton species                
              Florisphaera profunda as a paleoceanographic proxy.  The study will            
              estimate spatial and temporal variations in mean heat content of               
              tropical turbulent layer of the Atlantic using this spp. as a                  
              proxy.  Results are considered important for atmosphere-ocean model            
              validation.  In addition, similar analyses of equatorial regions of            
              Ekman divergence in the Pacific will also be made to see if the                
              Pacific behaves the same way as the Atlantic in response to orbital            
              forcing in terms of nutricline/thermocline dynamics.  Chronological            
              potential of F. profunda will also be investigated.
