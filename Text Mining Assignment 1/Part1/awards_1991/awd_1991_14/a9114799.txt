Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary aim of this research is to investigate the mechanism of            
              solid state chemical reactions at the atomic level.  High-                     
              resolution electron microscopy (HREM), analytical electron                     
              microscopy (AEM), and associated techniques are used because of                
              their adequate lateral and temporal resolutions.  The chemical and             
              structural evolution of the amorphous gel to the crystalline                   
              ceramic will be examined along with structural and dynamic studies             
              of intercalated low-dimensional materials, and the complex oxide               
              systems of the rare earths and doped zirconia.  These studies are              
              important in developing new materials such as structural ceramics,             
              fast ion conductors, and sensors.
