Abstract    :
              An experimental study of the single crystal constitutive equations             
              and polycrystal behavior will be carried out with emphasis on the              
              determination of grain interaction in the behavior of                          
              polycrystalline aggregates.  This will be achieved by measurements             
              of the local finite plastic deformation in each grain, as well as              
              global finite plastic deformation of the polycrystal.  Compression,            
              tension and biaxial compression experiments will be performed on               
              polycrystals with very large grain size (4-12 mm), thus making it              
              possible to determine local deformation in each grains.  Material              
              and lattice rotations will be measured using marked grid or small              
              strain gage rosettes and x-ray diffraction technique, respectively.            
              Test samples will be made from very high purity aluminum and each              
              sample may contain twenty to thirty grains in order to obtain a                
              representative polycrystal behavior.  Experiments will also be                 
              performed on polycrystals (with regular or normal grain size) in               
              order to determine better constitutive models for finite plastic               
              deformation of these solids.
