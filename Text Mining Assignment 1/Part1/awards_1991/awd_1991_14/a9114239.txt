Abstract    :
              Because we can not resolve stars up close, the need for masses and             
              radii of stars remains a key to a wide variety of astrophysical                
              problems.  The most accurate way of determining these quantities               
              is by spectroscopic measurements of the line-of-sight ("radial")               
              velocities of eclipsing binary stars with time as they revolve                 
              around one another in orbit alternately blocking the light from one            
              another.  The Principal Investigator (PI) has devoted his career               
              to these measurements, particularly to the measurement of orbits               
              around massive stars.  The PI will extend this work for the next               
              two years to stars with masses just less than the Sun's and will               
              use modern Charge Coupled Device detectors to measure their orbital            
              velocities more accurately than from photographic spectra and for              
              fainter stars.  This work is expected to help place the Sun in the             
              context of the physical parameters of similar stars.
