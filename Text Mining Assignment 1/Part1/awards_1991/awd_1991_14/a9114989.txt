Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Global Change research will require scientists trained in                      
              multidisciplinary approaches to research and technological                     
              development over the next decade.  It will also require an                     
              informed and literate public to make wise resource use choices                 
              through the utilization of the results of the scientific                       
              research.  Human resources development, therefore, will need to                
              be multidisciplinary and include the human dimensions of global                
              change.  Many of the federal agencies are addressing these needs               
              through development of agency specific educational opportunities               
              but with no long-term framework or strategy for coordination and               
              cooperation.  The role of the CEES is to provide the coordinating              
              mechanism for cooperative program planning and development.  As a              
              result, the University of Rhode Island, in cooperation with the                
              CEES Task Group on Glocal Change Education, is proposing a Global              
              Change Education Program Coordination Workshop for July, 1991.                 
                                                                                             
              The first objective of the workshop is to develop a long-term                  
              framework and strategy for the CEES Education Task Group.  The                 
              long-term plan will include educational opportunities and                      
              alternatives for K-14 (precollege and early college), upper level              
              college and graduate programs, and informal, public education.                 
              All of the education and training programs of the Task Group are               
              intended to complement the science priorities of CEES.                         
                                                                                             
              The second objective is to provide a cooperative and coordinated               
              approach for all federal govenment agency global change education              
              programs.  Such a cooperative approach would help to avoid                     
              emphases on one area to the detriment of other important foci.                 
                                                                                             
              The workshop planned for the W. Alton Jones Campus of the                      
              University of Rhode Island on July 14-17, 1991 will result in at               
              least two tangible products:                                                   
                                                                                             
                   1)   A long-term educational strategy plan including                      
                        prioritized options; and                                             
                   2)   Draft implementation strategies.
