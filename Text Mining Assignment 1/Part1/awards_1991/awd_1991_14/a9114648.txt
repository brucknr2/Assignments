Abstract    :
              One of the U.S. PIs, Peter A. Wehinger, Susan                                  
              Wyckoff, and their graduate student, Marvin                                    
              Kleine, will visit their Australian                                            
              counterpart, Dr. Bruce A. Peterson of the                                      
              Australian National University, once in each of                                
              three years.  The goals of this research are to                                
              determine the carbon isotope abundance ratio in                                
              a sample of bright comets, and to determine the                                
              12C/13C abundance ratio in the local                                           
              interstellar medium by observing absorption                                    
              lines of molecules and molecular ions (CN, CH,                                 
              and CH+) in the lines-of-sight of bright 0- and                                
              B-type stars.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Also proposed is the development of a full                                     
              fluorescence model for CN to improve the                                       
              accuracy with which we can determine the carbon                                
              and nitrogen isotope ratios in comets.  The                                    
              researchers will use the Mount Stromolo                                        
              Observatory's 1.9 meter telescope located near                                 
              Canberra, Australia, with its coude-echelle                                    
              spectrograph and photo-counting array.  In the                                 
              Northern Hemisphere, the investigators will use                                
              the Kitt Peak National Observatory coude-feed                                  
              telescope and echelle spectrograph.                                            
                                                                                             
              The research, which is essentially a                                           
              continuation of a successful collaborative                                     
              effort begun with Comet Halley in 1986 with                                    
              U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program                                     
              support, is important because of what it may                                   
              reveal about the formation of the early                                        
              universe.  Additional financial support for the                                
              domestic U.S. research comes from NASA and NSF                                 
              grants.
