Abstract    :
                   A modulated crossed beam method is used to measure cross                  
              sections for electron impact excitation of atomic hydrogen to the              
              lower excited atomic levels, n - 2, 3 and 4 from threshold                     
              electron impact energy up to 300eV.  The objective is to provide               
              a test of basic scattering calculations and to resolve existing                
              discrepancies between theory and experiment.  To this end, the                 
              measurements are calibrated on an absolute basis, and the angular              
              dependencies are measured, the only measurements of this kind is               
              the United States.
