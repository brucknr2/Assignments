Abstract    :
                   The goal of the research is to enhance the development of                 
              product requirements through a better understanding of customer                
              requirements.  Customer requirements are those things that                     
              customers would like to see realized in a product and are usually              
              represented qualitatively before concepts are developed.  Product              
              requirements are quantitative, and measurable parameters of a                  
              product that will satisfy customer requirements.  For example, a               
              customer requirement for the ON-OFF button of a remote control may             
              be that "it gives a snap feedback response against my finger when              
              I push it".  From this information, the product team needs to                  
              develop product requirements to define the product, such as "return            
              force = 6 N" and "button travel = 0.5 centimeters".                            
                   This research is a multidisciplinary effort joining expertise             
              in engineering and marketing along with industrial involvement for             
              an endeavor that is both applicable and relevant.  Product                     
              requirements that are quantitative and measurable are essential for            
              product definition.  For design projects that involve several                  
              individuals, a documented set of requirements is essential for                 
              project management and reaching consensus among team members.                  
              Furthermore, developing product requirements is an essential step              
              in current design methods, such as Quality Function Deployment, and            
              Value Engineering.
