Abstract    :
              The objective of this study is to reduce the magnitude of erosion              
              due to slurry particles in turbulent flows in seals and pumps                  
              through improved design.  The new designs will be developed by                 
              computational fluid dynamics applied to turbulent flowing an                   
              annulus with an inner rotating cylinder, a dead end wall, and                  
              several protrusions.  The protrusions reduce the speed of the                  
              slurry particles and divert them to the outflow stream.  The size              
              and location of the protrusions will be optimized in the                       
              computational program and the results confirmed by experimentation             
              involving laser flow visualization and laser doppler velocity                  
              measurements.  The project has strong industrial participation.
