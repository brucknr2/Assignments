Abstract    :
                   The objectives of this research project are to evaluate the               
              design of an alternate container system, called a postal pak, and              
              provide optimized system parameters with regards to the reliability            
              of the postal pak and potential damage to bulk mail.                           
                  This internship project will be carried out in collaboration               
              with the United States Postal Service.  The results of this                    
              research should have a long-term impact on the design of bulk mail             
              handling systems and distribution systems in general.
