Abstract    :
                   The research is to develop hardware and control software                  
              for multi-degree of freedom (MDOF), Automated Guided Vehicles                  
              (AGV).  Though the benefits of MDOF AGVs are well known, in terms              
              of high  maneuverability, their utilization is not universal                   
              because they  represent a very difficult control problem.  This is             
              because MDOF AGVs are characterized as an overconstrained system               
              from a control perspective and prototypes that have been developed             
              by industry  have been plagued with control problems described as              
              shaking and slipping.  Preliminary investigation of this problem               
              reveal that the combination of specially designed drive kinematics             
              and special control algorithms are likely to yield satisfactory                
              solutions to this problem.  This research will include the                     
              development of a prototype to test the system.                                 
                   The successful development of MDOF AGVs will allow the                    
              implementation of this level of automation in existing, older                  
              manufacturing facilities with only minor modifications to plant                
              layout.  This will have an impact on the manufacturing productivity            
              of older industry segments and provide international leadership to             
              the domestically based AGV industry.
