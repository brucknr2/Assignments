Abstract    :
                   This grant provides infrastructure support for the                        
              development of the research and educational activities of the                  
              Laboratory for Electronic Networking and Distributed Systems                   
              at Bowie State University.  The support includes computing                     
              equipment and software, faculty development costs, and                         
              student assistantships.  The principal investigators will                      
              conduct research in (1) distributed heterogeneous data and                     
              information management. (2) data compression techniques, and                   
              (3)distributed artificial intelligence systems.  In addition,                  
              the educational activities will include further development                    
              of a pipeline program to attract and retain more minority                      
              students in computer science careers.  Components of this                      
              program include a mentoring project for minority                               
              undergraduates, summer training in computer programming for                    
              high school students, tutoring and laboratory research                         
              experiences for undergraduates.//
