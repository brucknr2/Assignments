Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this US-Poland research project between                       
              Dr. Alan L. Balch of the University of California-Davis                        
              and Dr. Lechoslaw Latos-Grazynski of the Institute of                          
              Chemistry, University of Wroclaw, Poland, is to explore                        
              the synthesis and coordination properties of core-modified                     
              porphyrins -- porphyrins which one or more of the pyrrole                      
              nitrogens has been altered, particularly by replacement                        
              with a different heteroatom.  The researchers anticipate                       
              that these ligands will stabilize metal ions in low                            
              oxidation states and in planar, rather than tetrahedral                        
              geometry.  The reactivity of the metal ions in these                           
              unusual environments will be examined.  They will continue                     
              their studies of the coordination properties of                                
              monothiaporphyrins, particularly their (formal) Ni(I) and                      
              Pd(I) complexes.  Results are expected to improve our                          
              understanding of certain aspects of metallobiochemistry                        
              and may yield complexes that are good catalysts for                            
              alkylation or oxidation of organic molecules.                                  
                                                                                             
              This project in chemistry fulfills the program objective                       
              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                          
              experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                     
              complementary talents and pool resources in areas of                           
              strong mutual interest and competence.
