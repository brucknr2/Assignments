Abstract    :
                   This project involves using the Global Positioning System                 
              (GPS) in eastern Indonesia, a region of broad deformation where the            
              continental margins of Australia and Southeast Asia and the oceanic            
              plates of the Pacific and Philippine Sea are coming together at                
              rates of 80 to 110 mm/yr. Plate tectonic concepts do not explain               
              the evolution of Indonesia and other diffusely deforming belts                 
              except very generally because deformation is not confined to the               
              edges of well-defined, rigid plates.  Hence, the study of Indonesia            
              and places like it will be critical in developing more general                 
              theories of global tectonics and expanding our knowledge of the                
              dynamics of plate interactions.  Eastern Indonesia is at the stage             
              of assembly of the crustal elements, both continental and oceanic,             
              that will eventually form a complex mountain belt.  The strain                 
              field within such deforming regions is a first-order observation               
              that can constrain ideas about the behavior of the crust and upper             
              mantle in mountain building.
