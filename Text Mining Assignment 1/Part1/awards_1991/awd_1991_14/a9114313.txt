Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The overall objective of the research is to understand better and              
              to make more predictable the expansion of concrete due to alkali-              
              silica reaction.  The work consists of three broad tasks: 1) to                
              develop a new test method, similar to ASTM C441, to measure the                
              potential reactivity of portland cement in combination with alkali-            
              reactive siliceous aggregate; 2) to develop a performance                      
              specification for the potential reactivity of portland cement in               
              combination with  alkali-reactive siliceous aggregate for proposal             
              as an alterative to optional specification on alkali content                   
              currently included in C150; and 3) to develop a model that                     
              describes the kinetics of expansion due to alkali-silica reaction,             
              aimed at improving our understanding of the factors that control               
              expansion and at improving the estimation of ultimate expansion                
              from short-term, accelerated tests.
