Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Sensory transduction is the process by which a receptor cell                   
              becomes activated physiologically in response to a particular                  
              stimulus.  In the olfactory system, some stimuli trigger the                   
              generation inside the cell of a class of molecule called a second              
              messenger, in this case a compound called inositol triphosphate,               
              IP3.  Recent experiments suggest this IP3 in turn binds to a                   
              protein in the cell membrane, and that protein then functions to               
              change the flow of ions through the membrane, and activate the                 
              cell by depolarizing it.  This IP3 receptor protein is thus a key              
              component of olfactory transduction, but relatively little is                  
              currently known about it.  This pilot Small Grants for                         
              Exploratory Research (SGER) project will utilize molecular                     
              biological techniques, instead of the more usual biochemical                   
              approach, to isolate clones of the receptor, for further                       
              biochemical and physiological analyses of the protein and                      
              its role.  The molecular approach promises a high yield of                     
              characterized protein.  If successful with this novel approach,                
              the impact will be on cell biology in general, since IP3 is                    
              important in several membrane functions in addition to its                     
              central role in olfactory sensory transduction.
