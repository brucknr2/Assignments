Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funding for an international workshop to be             
              held in Maine in October 1991. The workshop will bring together                
              natural and social scientists from the United States, Canada,                  
              Scandinavia and the United Kingdom with a common interest in                   
              studying past human use of terrestrial and marine resources, and               
              adaptation to the changing climate in the North Atlantic region.               
              This workshop will provide an opportunity for addressing                       
              methodological and integrative research problems involving                     
              cooperative work by zooarchaeologists, ethnographers,                          
              paleobotanists and landscape archaeologists.
