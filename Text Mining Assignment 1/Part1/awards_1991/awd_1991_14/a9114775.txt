Abstract    :
              A novel radiographic flow visualization technique, whose                       
              development was initiated under a NSF research equipment                       
              grant, is proposed to study the buoyancy and surface tension                   
              induced convection and their interaction with phase change in                  
              model systems relevant to materials processing, including                      
              crystal growth and casting.  The technique is based on the use                 
              of metallurgically compatible, neutrally buoyant tracer                        
              particles which are more radio-opaque compared to the melt.                    
              The proposed work will include further development of the                      
              radiographic tracer technique as well as studies on the                        
              convection-mediated solidification processes, including the                    
              formation of mushy zone.
