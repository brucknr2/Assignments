Abstract    :
              During the last decade improvements in observations have                       
              demonstrated that a substantial fraction of young stellar                      
              objects (particularly the T Tauri stars and mysterious                         
              Herbig-Haro objects) expel oppositely directed jets of                         
              material.  In this two-year renewal award, the Principal                       
              Investigator and his collaborator, Dr. Noriega-Cresbo,                         
              will observe the jets in several of these objects in                           
              both directions on the sky. They will use the radiative                        
              transfer techniques they have developed in their last                          
              award to study the two dimensional structure of the                            
              jets and also construct computer models simulating the                         
              evolution of the condensations they have observed along                        
              these jets.  This work is the primary observational                            
              evidence of "bow shocks" being created from stellar                            
              ejections into the ambient circumstellar medium. Such                          
              structures are also observed in active galaxies. It                            
              is to be expected that this work will affect our understanding                 
              of the creation of jets both from stars and the nuclei of                      
              galaxies.
