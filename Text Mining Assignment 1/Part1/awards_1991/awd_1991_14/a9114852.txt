Abstract    :
                   The research work will examine the mechanics of superplastic              
              deformation with the intent of providing broadly applicable flow               
              rules for use in the modeling of the superplastic forming process.             
              Such a model can be used to devise processing methods which                    
              increase the productivity of the superplastic forming process and              
              increase its range of application.  The research study is a                    
              comprehensive one, including aspects of strain-rate path effects,              
              anisotropy, grain coarsening, cavitation and interfacial friction              
              modeling.  The project involves verification of the research models            
              in laboratory tests and in tests on production equipment in                    
              industry.                                                                      
                   Superplastic forming is used to shape high performance alloys             
              in aerospace application and will find increased use in its                    
              applications to the forming of titanium aluminides and other, "next            
              generation" aerospace materials.  Better understanding of the                  
              behavior of materials during superplastic forming will allow the               
              fabrication of high performance parts at lower cost and with higher            
              reliability.
