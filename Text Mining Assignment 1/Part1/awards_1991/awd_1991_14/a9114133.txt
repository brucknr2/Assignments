              This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science                            
              Program supports U.S. participation in a U.S.-                                 
              Brazilian Workshop                                                             
              on Dynamics and Control of Multi-body Systems to be                            
              held at the Instituto Politecnico do Rio de Janeiro,                           
              Friburgo, Brazil, from March 1-5, 1993.  The                                   
              organizers are Professor Richard Montgomery of the                             
              University of California, Santa Cruz and Dr. Jair                              
              Koiller of the National Laboratory of Scientific                               
              Computing, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.                                             
                                                                                             
              The purpose of the workshop is to bring together U.S.                          
              and Brazilian mathematicians to discuss recent                                 
              progress in the study of complex interconnected                                
              mechanical systems with rigid as well as elastic                               
              components. The tradition of excellence of Brazil in                           
              dynamical systems coupled with the high quality of the                         
              proposed U.S. participants will lead to an interaction                         
              that will lay the groundwork for future collaboration.
