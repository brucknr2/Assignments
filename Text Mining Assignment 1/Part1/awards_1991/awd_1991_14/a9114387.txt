Abstract    :
              In this project in Experimental Physical Chemistry, Chemistry                  
              Division, Prof. Weltner (U. Florida) will use Electron Spin                    
              Resonance and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy to study                 
              clusters of metals, carbon, and semiconductors trapped at low                  
              temperatures in rare gas matrices. Novel aspects of the work                   
              include magnetic field dependence of IR spectra and ESR spectra                
              of microcrystalline metal particles.

              Prof. Weltner (U. Florida) will trap very small particles of                   
              metals and semiconductors at low temperatures, and study them                  
              using infrared and radio frequency irradiation. This is                        
              important because it provides fundamental information on how                   
              assemblies of molecules interact to give desirable properties                  
              of bulk materials.
