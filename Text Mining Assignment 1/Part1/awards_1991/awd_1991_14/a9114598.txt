Abstract    :
                   Bosart proposes to continue his case study analyses of                    
              subsynoptic scale midlatitude cyclones and fronts. Specifically,               
              he proposes to complete a final set of case studies using date                 
              from the GALE (1986) field experiment, to begin collaborative                  
              research on the numerical prediction of coastal mesoscale weather              
              systems, and to participate in the STORM-FEST (1992) field                     
              experiment and the post-experiment analysis phase. This                        
              experiment will produce data sets gathered by next-generation                  
              observational systems (e.g. Profilers and Doppler radars).                     
              Evaluation and systems testing of their capability to enhance                  
              operational detection and forecasting of intense mesoscale                     
              weather events are among the primary experimental objectives. In               
              addition, there have been defined scientific objectives for a set              
              of frontal and mesoscale studies of cool-season weather systems                
              typical of the central US. Bosart's third line of proposed                     
              research is focussed on this last set of objectives. He has                    
              contributed to the scientific planning of the field experiment,                
              by conducting background climatological analyses and identifying               
              specific research opportunities that should result.                            
                                                                                             
                   The proposed work is expected to be a major contribution to               
              STORM-FEST's scientific objectives, based on Bosart's role in                  
              similar field experiments in the past. It will augment the return              
              from the significant investment in scientific resources                        
              represented by the experiment.
