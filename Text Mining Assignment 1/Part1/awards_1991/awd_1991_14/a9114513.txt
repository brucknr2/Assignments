Abstract    :
              This project will design an                                                    
              electromagnetic wave life-detection                                            
              system for post earthquake rescue                                              
              operations.  This system will                                                  
              detect the heart beat, breathing or                                            
              other movements of human victims                                               
              trapped in collapsed masonry or                                                
              reinforced concrete structures.                                                
              The system will consist of a                                                   
              central unit of microwave

              antenna system.  Preliminary                                                   
              experimental results indicate a                                                
              high probability of success for                                                
              constructing such a system.

              field application of the system                                                
              will be developed by researchers at

              functioning system is constructed,                                             
              it will be field tested in                                                     
              realistic earthquake environments                                              
              constructed for urban search and                                               
              rescue training and testing.
