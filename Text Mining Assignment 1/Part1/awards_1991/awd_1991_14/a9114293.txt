Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation                
              to study the properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, and                   
              sea-ice on a transect between Murmansk, USSR and Nome, Alaska.                 
              There are few published measurements of biomass or production                  
              from most shelf and basin regions of the Arctic Ocean.  This                   
              project is one of four that will evaluate biological processes in              
              the Arctic Ocean during the Trans-Arctic cruise of the SOVETSKIY               
              SOYUZ.  It will investigate role of microzooplankton in the                    
              Arctic Ocean.  Specific studies will determine the abundance and               
              distributions of microheterotrophs in the Arctic Basin and                     
              several marginal seas; measure grazing rates of these organisms                
              and; contribute to a collaborative program that will evaluate the              
              flux of carbon in the Arctic Ocean.
