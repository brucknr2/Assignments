Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fracture mechanics of quasibrittle materials, which include high               
              performance materials such as high strength concrete, has emerged              
              during the last few years but one key aspect is still ignored- the             
              effects of leading rate (beyond the dynamic range), load cycling               
              and fatigue.  Experiments and theory, focused on concretes and also            
              covering rocks will be conducted.  The tests of notched fracture               
              specimens will include: 1) load-deflection curves at various                   
              constant displacement rates, 2) load relaxation tests in the post-             
              peak softening range, 3) fatigue tests and 4) renotching tests.                
              Part of the testing will be carried out in cooperation with                    
              industry, Material Service Corp., Chicago.  The theoretical                    
              formulations, in the order of improving approximation but                      
              decreasing simplicity, will include: 1) Rate generalization of R-              
              curve approach; 2) Cohesive line-crack model with viscoplasticity              
              in the bulk of the specimen and viscoplasticity in the relation of             
              bridging stress to opening displacement, solved by means of a                  
              singular integro-differential equation based on smeared-tip                    
              superposition of cracks: 3) nonlocal finite element model with                 
              cracking damage, creep and rate-dependent nonlinear triaxial                   
              constitutive model for the fracture process zone; and 4)                       
              generalization of the random particle model simulating the                     
              microstructure of concrete.  Resolution of this problem will pave              
              the way for development of better materials; for their more                    
              effective and safer utilization; for better and safer designs of               
              special or very large concrete structures beyond the range of                  
              existing experience; for more reliable predictions of long-time                
              cracking in concrete structures; and for more realistic predictions            
              of the failure of rock slopes, excavations, underground openings               
              and boreholes.
