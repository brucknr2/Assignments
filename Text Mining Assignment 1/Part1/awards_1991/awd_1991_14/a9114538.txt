Abstract    :
              Research aimed at modeling the compaction and early stages of                  
              sintering of powders when a liquid phase coexists with the                     
              particulate solid will be conducted.  The study  will also shed                
              some light on constitutive modeling of the mechanical response of              
              materials fabricated using such a technique.  To accomplish these              
              goals, a continuum model will be developed on the basis of some                
              thermomicromechanical considerations, so that the effects of                   
              fabric anisotropy and interparticle forces are properly accounted              
              for.  In addition, the model will account for the relative                     
              sliding of grains during compaction, as well as the sintering                  
              induced distortional and volumetric deformation rates.  In                     
              parallel with the development of the continuum model, a discrete               
              material model of compaction of granular materials will be                     
              developed using a linear programming technique.  After                         
              validation, this model can be used to verify the hypotheses made               
              in formulating the continuum model.
