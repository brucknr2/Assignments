Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for funds  to support a symposium on                        
              applications of 3D imaging and analysis in neurobiology.  The                  
              basic correlations of morphology and physiology as investigated                
                                                                                             
              by confocal light microscopy and three-dimensional electron                    
              microscopy will be addressed.  Ion imaging, such as calcium                    
              gradients, will not be emphasized.  The symposium meeting is in                
              New Orleans November 10-15.
