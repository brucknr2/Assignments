Abstract    :
              This grant supports a symposium on martensitic phase                           
              transformations, ICOMAT-92, to be held in Monterey, California,                
              July 20-24, 1992.  Several topics are to be covered in the                     
              conference, including the physics of the martensite phase                      
              transformation, mathematical modeling, bainitic transformations,               
              the shape memory effect, crystallography, microstructure, and the              
              properties of martensites.  Applications of materials with                     
              martensitic transformations are also considered.  The proceedings              
              are to be published in a volume that consists of the technical                 
              papers accepted for the conference.

              Martensites are used in a number of materials systems, including               
              shape memory alloys, steels, ferroelectrics, and tough ceramics and            
              cermets.  The conference highlights these applications and looks at            
              other possible areas for use.
