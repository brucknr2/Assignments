Abstract    :
                   This grant provides infrastructure support for the                        
              development of the research and educational activities of the                  
              Scientific Parallel Processing Applied Research Center at the                  
              University of the District of Columbia.  The support includes                  
              computing equipment, undergraduate student assistantships,                     
              and faculty release time.  The principal investigators will                    
              conduct research in (1) intelligent Databases and Expert                       
              Systems for Supercomputers, and (2) Cognitive Sciences for                     
              Storage and Processing of Images.  The educational component                   
              of this project provides undergraduate research experiences,                   
              summer internships, student participation in symposia and                      
              conferences, and peer mentoring.***
