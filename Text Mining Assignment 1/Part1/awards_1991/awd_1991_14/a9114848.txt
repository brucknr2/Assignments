Abstract    :
              This is a Renewal Award with reference to work that was                        
              conducted under NSF Grant No. 88-13714.  In research                           
              conducted under that award, the investigators performed                        
              supercritical extraction of model synthetic mixtures of                        
              organic pollutants in water solutions and concluded that a                     
              process based upon this concept is feasible for removal of                     
              contaminants from water solution.  The objective of work                       
              under this Renewal Award is to obtain a better                                 
              understanding than now exists of the properties of the                         
              process such as its thermodynamic characteristics and rate                     
              at which it functions as a steps toward evaluating its                         
              engineering relevance and significance.  Knowledge                             
              obtained in this research will then be applied to                              
              improvement of models that may be used in engineering                          
              design of the process and systems utilizing it.                                
                                                                                             
              The supercritical extraction process being studied in this                     
              research is potentially especially applicable to treatment                     
              of wastewaters that are contaminated with substances that                      
              are resistant to biological degradation.  Results of this                      
              research are expected to be applied to the engineering                         
              design of processes and systems based on use of                                
              supercritical extraction for decontamination of aqueous                        
              wastes.
