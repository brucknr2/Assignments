Abstract    :
                This grant supports outside-China travel for three U.S.                      
              university scientists to attend the Workshop on Scientific Uses                
              of China Digital Seismographic Network Data in Beijing, PRC, in                
              May, 1991.  The CDSN has provided an invaluable new data set for               
              a part of the world that has lacked significant seismographic                  
              coverage in the past.  The data is useful for general studies of               
              the earth's structure and for earthquake hazard research                       
              conducted by both U.S. and PRC scientists.  The meeting is                     
              organized under the US/PRC Earthquake Studies Protocol.  China's               
              State Seismological Bureau, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the                
              National Science Foundation are the members of the Protocol.                   
              This travel and symposium is important to the successful conduct               
              of U.S. projects of earthquake hazards research planned or                     
              underway in the PRC.  This research is a component of the                      
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
