Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The workshop examines the state of the art in dilute                           
              separation with emphasis on environmental problems and life                    
              science and life applications.  The goal is to identify                        
              research needs, detect current trends, and define                              
              opportunities for research.  Experts from industry,                            
              university, and government will give presentations and discuss                 
              outstanding problems in dilute stream separations.  The                        
              results will be useful for determining priorities for future                   
              research projects and for resource allocation at the National                  
              Science Foundation.
