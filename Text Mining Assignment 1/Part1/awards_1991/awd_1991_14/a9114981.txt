Abstract    :
                    The principal objective of this research program is the                  
              creation of a public-use tape suitable for a prospective study of              
              aging in a random sample of 39,616 men mustered into the Union Army            
              during 1861-1865. Approximately 31,000 of the individuals in the               
              sample lived to be age 40 and over between 1870 and 1940.  The tape            
              will cover virtually the entire life-cycle of the recruits.  It                
              will contain information on the socioeconomic characteristics of               
              the households in which they were reared and of the prevalence of              
              specific diseases in the localities in which they lived during                 
              their developmental ages;  it will also contain their health                   
              histories while in the service,  including various measures of                 
              stress;  and it will contain their occupational,  residential,  and            
              health histories from the dates they left the service until their              
              deaths,  as well as information on the cause of their deaths.                  
                    The tape will provide the basis for four analytical projects             
              that are titled:  (1)  Exposure to Disease During Growing Ages and             
              War Service;  (2)  Early Predictors of Morbidity and Mortality at              
              Later Ages;  (3)  Secular Trends in Labor Force Activity at Older              
              Ages;  (4)  Intergenerational and Familial Aspects of Aging.                   
                    The research team is first-rate,  well balanced in skills and            
              experienced in the areas in which they will be working.  The                   
              extraordinary data set produced will permit the exploration of                 
              important and little understood issues in socio-economic history               
              as well as in current policy.  In addition,  the analytical tools              
              and relationships developed should find extensive use in many                  
              disciplines.                                                                   
                     Approximately,  two-thirds of the estimated $3,622,580 cost             
              of the project is being borne by the National Institute of Aging               
              (NIA). Other prospective funders outside NIA include the National              
              Science Foundation,  the National Medical Library,  and various                
              private sources.  Their combined contributions should suffice to               
              assure the financial feasibility of the five-year project.
