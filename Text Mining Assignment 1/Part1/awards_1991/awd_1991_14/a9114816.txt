Abstract    :
                   Professor Ulmer will work on the arithmetic of elliptic                   
              curves and automorphic forms over function fields.  In                         
              particular, he intends to work on analogues of the conjecture of               
              Mazur that asserts that the group of rational points on an                     
              elliptic curve defined over a function field over a finite field               
              in a certain Zp extension is finitely generated.                               
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
