Abstract    :
              We purpose an NJIT-ETDL joint research project                                 
              to study the design, fabrication, and                                          
              characterization of monolithic GaAs 8-12 u direct                              
              multiple quantum well (MQW) injection image                                    
              sensor ?1!.  We purpose the GaAs/A1GaAs MQW                                    
              infrared hot electron transistor (IHET, invented at                            
              ETDL) as the photodetector, and direct injection                               
              through an undoped GaAs layer as the mechanism                                 
              for interfacing between 8-12 u IR photodetectors                               
              and current readout devices.  The proposed image                               
              sensor or focal plane array (FPA) structure is                                 
              optimized for 300 K thermal imaging performance,                               
              as well as for fabrication simplicity.  Special                                
              attention is paid to readout charge handling and                               
              detector array fill factor, as well as the                                     
              minimization of noise and cross talk.
