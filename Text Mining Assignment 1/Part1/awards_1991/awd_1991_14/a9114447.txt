Abstract    :
              The proposed work will treat the soil sampling process as a                    
              strain-controlled problem for predicting strain histories                      
              (or paths) followed by soil elements during the push                           
              sampling. Analytic framework together with complementary                       
              experimental measurements, will be utilized. Analytic                          
              investigations will be performed to determine the soil                         
              deformations and changes of stresses and pore pressures                        
              taking place during and after sampling of soft, saturated                      
              cohesive deposits. Parametric studies will be carried out                      
              to quantify influence of various factors which contribute                      
              to sampling disturbance. Experimental investigations will                      
              be performed in the laboratory to evaluate and validate                        
              analytic predictions.
