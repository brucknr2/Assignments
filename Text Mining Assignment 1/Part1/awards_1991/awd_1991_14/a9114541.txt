Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     This project will continue the time series study of the vent           
              fluids at the hydrothermal site located a 21 degrees north on the              
              East Pacific Rise.  Since this hydrothermal site was discovery in              
              1979 three expeditions to this location have established that the              
              exit temperatures and distinct interfield differences in fluid                 
              composition have remained constant with time at the four vent                  
              fields.  This project will allow the principal investigator to                 
              document any changes in chemistry and temperature at each site                 
              and will extend the study of this hydrothermal system to over a                
              decade.  The results will improve understanding of the evolution               
              of seafloor hydrothermal systems and will further constrain the                
              processes that control the hydrothermal fluxes of elements into                
              the oceans.
