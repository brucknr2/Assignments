Abstract    :
              The first National Symposium on Frontiers of Science meeting was held in       
              March 1989 at the Beckman Center in Irvine, California.  A second              
              meeting was held November 1-3, 1990.  The meetings are designed to bring       
              together a selected group of young U. S. scientists to discuss exciting        
              advances and opportunities in their respective fields in a format that         
              encourages, and allows adequate time for, informal one-on-one                  
              discussions among participants.  Interaction of the future leaders of U.       
              S. science is intended, inter alia, to stimulate future collaboration in       
              research and the transfer of new techniques and approaches across              
              fields.  Speakers focus their talks on current cutting-edge research in        
              their field to a scientifically sophisticated but non-specialist               
              audience and provide a sense of the experimental data--what is actually        
              measured and seen in the various fields.  They provide information such        
              as:  What are the major research problems and unique tools in the field?       
              What are the current limitations on advances as well as the frontiers?         
                                                                                             
              Topics for the November 7-9, 1991 meeting include:  aging, AIDS and AIDS       
              transmission, biological structure, immunology, materials chemistry,           
              protein structure and folding, evolutionary biology, particle physics,         
              nuclear physics, the Sun, dark matter, cosmic wave background, planetary       
              science, mass extinctions, oceanography, global change, earthquake             
              science and prediction, artificial intelligence, combinatorial                 
              algorithms, computational geometry, micromachining, laser atom trapping,       
              scanning tunneling microscopy, and accelerator mass spectrometry.
