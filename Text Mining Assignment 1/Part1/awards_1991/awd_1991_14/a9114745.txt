Abstract    :
              High-temperature deformation of metal-matrix composites will be                
              studied from the micromechanics standpoint.  The study will also               
              include the influence of distributed damage in the ductile matrix              
              on the overall time-dependent behavior of the material.  Guided by             
              the observations that most metallic constituents may undergo both              
              primary and secondary creep in addition to the usual elastic                   
              deformation, and that the creep rate usually depends on stress                 
              nonlinearly, the following four specific problems will be examined:            
              (1) stress-strain relation of the composite under a constant strain            
              rate, (2) higher creep strain range, and (4) the extension to a                
              higher particle or fiber concentration.  These studies will be                 
              carried out with a special reference to the practical and potential            
              service environments.  Whenever possible, simple macroscopic                   
              constitutive theories which can reflect the essential features of              
              these micromechanical considerations will be developed for design              
              and analysis.  The aim is to translate this scientific knowledge               
              into use, so that the microstructures which would provide the                  
              strongest creep resistance under the service conditions could be               
              identified.
