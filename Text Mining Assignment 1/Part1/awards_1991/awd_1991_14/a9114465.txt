Abstract    :
              In this project, scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic                  
              Institution (WHOI) will assist scientists from the Instituto                   
              Espanol de Oceanografia, of Madrid, Spain, in carrying out a                   
              hydrographic section along approximately 24|N in the Atlantic from             
              Spain to the Bahamas aboard the Spanish vessel R/V Cornide.  This              
              section has been occupied twice before, in 1957 and 1981, with                 
              intriguing and unexplained changes observed in deep water                      
              properties.  A repeat at this time will address fundamental issues             
              in the relationship of these changes to climate change.  The WHOI              
              effort will assist the Spanish in ensuring high quality data which             
              will contribute to the WOCE Hydrographic Program.
