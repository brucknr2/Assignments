Abstract    :
              The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation                                   
              Engineers (SPIE), together with the Optical Society                            
              of America (OSA), and the International Commission                             
              for Optics (ICO) will present, in cooperation with the                         
              Leningrad Institute of Fine Mechanics and Optics                               
              (LIFMO), and the D.S. Rozhdestvensky All-Union                                 
              Optical Society of the USSR, the 1991 International                            
              Conference on Education in Optics in Leningrad,                                
              USSR, 28 September - 1 October 1991.                                           
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this conference is to bring optics                              
              educators from around the world together in the                                
              Soviet Union to share education and training                                   
              methods in modern optics.  The conference intends                              
              to establish an on-going forum for the sharing of                              
              international and inter-cultural teaching and learning                         
              mechanics and philosophies.  The project is proposed                           
              over a 16-month period beginning November 1990                                 
              with its organization and public promotion to its end                          
              in February 1992 at the publication and distribution                           
              of the conference Proceedings approximately 5                                  
              months after the conference.  The technical program                            
              is organized by academic representatives of                                    
              international university optics programs and is                                
              structured around 19 invited talks by highly respected                         
              optics educators.  Contributed papers are presently                            
              being solicited to supplement the invited program.                             
              An exhibit of IBM- and Macintosh-compatible                                    
              software and displays by university optics programs                            
              will complement the technical agenda.  The intent of                           
              this conference is to further serve the optics                                 
              community to which SPIE, the OSA, and the ICO are                              
              dedicated.  The recent changes in world politics                               
              present a unique opportunity on all sides to exchange                          
              information, to teach and learn, and to further the                            
              cause of this branch of science to the benefit of all                          
              nations.
