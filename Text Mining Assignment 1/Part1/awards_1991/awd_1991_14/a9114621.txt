Abstract    :
                   A generalized framework for characterizing the quality                    
              degradation and predicting failures among critical components                  
              within several computer numerically controled machine tools                    
              will be investigated.  "Failure" in this context refers to                     
              degradation of the critical components within a machine tool and/or            
              the quality of the finished product.  This framework will integrate            
              sensory devices with real-time knowledge bases and simulation                  
              models.  The implemented framework will provide an integrated                  
              environment for a maintenance supervisor to understand the quality             
              degradation process for various critical components within a                   
              machine tool and obtain early warnings about their failure time                
              intervals. Although the framework is general, the implementation               
              will be restricted to diagnosing quality degradation in grinding               
              machines.                                                                      
                   The research will focus on building a tested knowledge base               
              for characterizing the quality degradation process within grinding             
              machines, and reducing the response time in providing decisions                
              using knowledge bases and simulation.  Technology transfer of the              
              results will be achieved through interaction with industrial                   
              sponsors.
