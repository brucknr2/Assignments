Abstract    :
              This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program,               
              a U.S. Global Change Program.  This research project will                      
              emphasize spatial and seasonal variability in the radiation                    
              budget and the roles of surface reflectivity (albedo) and cloud                
              cover in regulating solar and terrestrial radiation in the lower               
              atmosphere.  Planetary albedo and brightness temperature data                  
              will be obtained from AVHRR satellite measurements.  Other                     
              satellite measurements, obtained using Synthetic Aperture Radar,               
              will provide surface type identification and albedos.   Data                   
              entries will be derived using theoretical and field research                   
              results.  These data will be used in modeling efforts to evaluate              
              irradiance and heating rates in the lower atmosphere.  Existing                
              radiation measurement programs at Barrow, Alaska, will provide                 
              validation for theoretical and modeling aspects of the study.
