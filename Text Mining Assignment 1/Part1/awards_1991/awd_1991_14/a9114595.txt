Abstract    :
              This research project deals with design and implementation of                  
              time-delay control theory for linear and nonlinear systems. The                
              technique combines parametric adaptation, past observations to                 
              directly estimate the effect of plant dynamics, state feedback                 
              and command feedforward  signals to achieve proper command                     
              following. The basic function of the controller is to observe the              
              system present, and delayed input and output responses at each                 
              sampling time, and then modify the control actions directly                    
              rather than using a model-based forward term or adjusting                      
              controller gains as is commonly done in other methods. The                     
              results of this research could potentially benefit control of                  
              systems with unknown dynamics and unpredictable disturbances such              
              as undersea vehicles and robotic manipulators. In addition,                    
              significant contributions could be made to the areas of learning               
              control and intelligent control also.***    //
