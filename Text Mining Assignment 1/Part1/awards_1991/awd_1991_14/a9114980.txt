Abstract    :
              This project will more fully document the major and trace element              
              composition of magmatic sulfides and the host rocks from the                   
              vent-facies intrusions and flows of the Tintic Mountain Volcanic               
              Group.  In addition, those from the Fish Canyon Tuff (and                      
              associated volcanic units), Bishop Tuff, and Central Nevada                    
              Caldera Complex (tuff of Williams Ridge and Morey Peak) will be                
              analyzed for comparison purposes.  By combing these data on                    
              sulfide compositions with intensive parameters and magmatic                    
              evolution for each volcanic system, it should be possible to                   
              model the origin and variations in modal abundance of magmatic                 
              sulfides.  The stability and degassing/exsolution characteristics              
              of these sulfides will also be examined.  These data should help               
              develop a general model about the role of magmatic sulfides in                 
              setting the metal ratios of various hydrothermal ore fluids.
