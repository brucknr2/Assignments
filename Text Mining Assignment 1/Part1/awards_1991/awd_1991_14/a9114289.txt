Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation                
              to study the properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, and                   
              sea-ice on a transect between Murmansk, USSR and Nome, Alaska.                 
              It will conduct helicopter-born sea ice thickness measurements                 
              using a unique electromagnetic induction sounding system recently              
              developed for this purpose.  The survey data will be used to                   
              assess mean sea ice thickness and salt content in relation to                  
              latitude and longitude.  This information will be useful in                    
              providing ground-truth for satellite systems currently in use and              
              in providing a bench mark for sea ice motion and thermodynamic                 
              models.
