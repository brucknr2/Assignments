Abstract    :
              The greatest puzzle in the field of stellar evolution is how stars             
              and attendant planetary systems are formed from their parent                   
              interstellar clouds.  In previous NSF-supported work, the Principal            
              Investigator (PI) has shown that the circumstellar clouds remaining            
              around half of all the young ("T Tauri") stars are massive enough              
              for them to evolve into planetary systems such as our own solar                
              system.   With a new three-year award from the NSF, the PI will                
              continue these studies with an emphasis on the role of the                     
              circumstellar disks around T Tauri stars in accreting and expelling            
              mass from the stellar systems.  The PI will also attempt to                    
              correlate the properties of young stars and the properties of their            
              interstellar clouds.  Most of the award will be used to support a              
              postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student, and two undergraduates on             
              this project.
