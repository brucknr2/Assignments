Abstract    :
              It is now well understood that the outbursts of "novae" are caused             
              by the dumping of hydrogen-rich material from a binary companion               
              onto a white dwarf and the detonation of this material by fusion               
              reactions in the hot crusts of white dwarfs.  However, the details             
              of this process and the events leading up to the explosion are not             
              well understood.  For example, they rely on a set of unknowns                  
              affecting the evolution of close binary stars and the hydrody-                 
              namical evolution of the shock wave as it emanates from the star.              
              The Principal Investigator (PI) will renew his study of these                  
              processes for three years.  The projects to be focused during                  
              the grant period are the dumping of material onto magnetized                   
              white dwarfs, an understanding of the mechanisms required for                  
              the synthesis of medium-mass nuclei, the cause of the cessation                
              of the nova outburst, and a study of the recurrence phenomenon                 
              in one subclass of novae.  This work is expected to complement                 
              the work on explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae, as it is                  
              now apparent that heavy nuclei must have been produced in a                    
              variety of sites in the early history of our Galaxy.
