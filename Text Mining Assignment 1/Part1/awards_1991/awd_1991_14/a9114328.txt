Abstract    :
              Research will be conducted on quantum chaos, which is the study of             
              wave systems in low dimension where the eikonal (classical) limit              
              is chaotic.  This field is highly interdisciplinary since many                 
              intriguing fundamental and technologically important problems in               
              chemistry, molecular physics, atomic physics, condensed matter                 
              physics, device engineering, etc, are related to work being done.              
              In many cases problems in quantum chaos can be cast in the form of             
              waves in pseudo-random potentials, which makes a connection to                 
              related problems of waves in random and incommensurate potentials.             
              %%%                                                                            
              Quantum chaos is an exciting cross-disciplinary field which                    
              combines the behavior of classical nonlinear dynamical systems with            
              quantum mechanics.  It is even unclear how these two highly                    
              disparate concepts should be merged to provide models for physical             
              systems.  The present research contributes to the foundations of               
              this field, particularly as it relates to condensed matter physics,            
              and develops models for real systems.
