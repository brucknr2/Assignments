Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for a workshop to identify the                              
              research needs for computational and mathematical                              
              techniques that have application to electric power                             
              systems.  Several workshop objectives are identified                           
              including a review of the current state of the art,                            
              identification of those computer intensive problems of                         
              importance to the electric power industry, and                                 
              identification of those "unsolved" computational and                           
              mathematical problems deserving future research.  This                         
              workshop will also be supported by the Electric Power                          
              Research Institute.
