Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A study of the climatology of the tropical oceans, focusing on the             
              Atlantic and the Indian oceans, will be continued using archived               
              data from ships of opportunity and satellites. It is hypothesized              
              that the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) dipole in the Equatorial                
              Atlantic is responsible for the observed decadal variability of                
              rainfall in Africa and South America.
