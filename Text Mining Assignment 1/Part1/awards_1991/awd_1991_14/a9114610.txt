Abstract    :
              The study of "asteroseismology," or the properties of pulsation                
              modes to determine the interior structure of stars, has been among             
              the most important and exciting areas of research in astronomy                 
              during the last decade.  The Principal Investigator (PI) intends               
              to continue previous work on the pulsations of several types of                
              stars using a computer program which determines the pulsation                  
              periods of a star precisely and self-consistently as the star's                
              structure evolves in time.  Such effects as mixing, nuclear                    
              "burning", and differential diffusion among the chemical elements              
              is taken into account, as are some types of magnetic field                     
              structures.  The PI will use this code to determine the thermo-                
              dynamic and magnetic structural properties of magnetically                     
              pulsating "A" stars and delta Scuti stars, whose properties in many            
              ways mimic the Sun's.  This work is expected to help place solar               
              and stellar physics within the same context so that advances made              
              in one area can benefit the other.
