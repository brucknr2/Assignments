Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is on pressure consolidation of powders into advanced            
              ceramic, metallic, and intermetallic composites. The goal of the               
              research is to develop an ability to predict densification that                
              will enable the selection of optimal temperatures and pressures for            
              processing these advanced materials. Analytical and numerical                  
              modeling will be carried out for both homogeneous and composite                
              materials. Related experiments will be conducted to provide insight            
              into the important physical processes of consolidation. Emphasis               
              will be placed on densification of powder around reinforcing                   
              fibers. Accordingly, experiments will be done to investigate the               
              incidence of fiber failure during consolidation. Models will also              
              be developed for fiber failure and for the effect of such failure              
              on the final mechanical properties of the consolidated composite               
              material. The science and technology developed in this project will            
              make it possible to process advanced composites with the desired               
              densified net shape and mechanical properties.
