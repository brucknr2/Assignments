Abstract    :
              In the last twenty years the construction of large aperture radio              
              interferometers has provided an essential tool in understanding the            
              physical characteristics of the "coronas" of several groups of                 
              stars.  Two such groups are the magnetically active lower main                 
              sequence stars (like the Sun) and very young ("naked T Tauri")                 
              stars whose outer envelopes have evaporated away enough to permit              
              their direct observation.  In this proposal a former NSF                       
              Presidential Young Investigator plans a one year observational                 
              survey of emissions from the coronas of these two groups of stars.             
              These radio data will be combined with x-ray and ultraviolet data              
              to provide a physical understanding of the plasma responsible for              
              flaring activity that in the coronas of these stars.  This project             
              will help bring order to a currently confused picture of the                   
              emission of radio- active stars and should ultimately help provide             
              a broad context within which to understand the differences and                 
              similarities of physical processes leading to the radio emissions              
              in several groups of stars, including the Sun.
