Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This workshop will finalize initial research plans of the                      
              International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP).  The                         
              operational phase of the IGBP consists of a number of core                     
              projects addressing different components of the total earth -                  
              oceans, atmosphere, and land, and their linkages through climate               
              and biogeochemical systems.  This workshop addresses the program               
              formulation phase of one of the core projects, the Global Change               
              and Terrestrial Ecosystems (GCTE) in a meeting of international                
              specialists at Asilomar, California on May 5-8, 1991.  The                     
              purpose of the meeting will be to review evolving research plans               
              for the focus dealing with the exchange of energy and material of              
              ecosystems as outlined by the IGBP (1990) and modified by the                  
              GCTE meeting in Brighton, England on February 19-21, 1991.
