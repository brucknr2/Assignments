Abstract    :
                   The intense heat sources associated with laser processing of              
              materials often affect the microstructure of the part being                    
              processed.  For example, in laser beam welding, the resulting high             
              cooling rates tend to produce brittle microstructures in high                  
              hardenability materials.  Such materials are normally pre-heated               
              before welding and may also be subjected to post-weld heat                     
              treatment.  Conventional pre-heating and post-weld heat treatment              
              are often either too expensive or impractical to use.  Such heat               
              treatments reduce productivity and may affect other parts of the               
              material.  To eliminate these problems, the researcher's will                  
              investigate the split-beam laser welding concept, where the laser              
              beam will be split into two, resulting in a dual heat source.  The             
              leading minor source will pre-heat the  material while the major               
              source will be used for the actual welding.  This pre-heat by the              
              leading source will achieve the lower cooling rate induced by                  
              conventional pre-heating in a single step.  Such control of                    
              microstructure by splitting of the laser beam can be extended to               
              other materials processing applications such as surface heat                   
              treatment.                                                                     
                   The work will include a thermal analysis of the problem,                  
              followed by (and to a large extent parallel with) an extensive                 
              experimental program both to verify the analyses, and to elucidate             
              the potential benefits of the split-beam laser materials processing            
              concept.  The experimental task will constitute the bulk of the                
              research project.
