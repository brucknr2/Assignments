Abstract    :
              This award supports visits over three years by a U.S. team,                    
              consisting of Drs. Charles R. Alcock, Timothy Axelrod, David                   
              Bennett, Kem Cook, and Hye-Sook Park of Lawrence Livermore                     
              National Laboratory, and Drs. Kim Griest, Saul Perlmutter, and                 
              Christopher Stubbs of the Center for Particle Astrophysics,                    
              University of California Berkeley, to collaborate with Drs. Ken                
              Freeman, Bruce Peterson, Peter Quinn, and Alex Rodgers of the                  
              Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories, Australian                      
              National University.  The team of investigators is developing                  
              a dedicated system with which they will conduct a definitive                   
              search for massive objects known as MACHOs (Massive Compact                    
              Halo Objects, such as brown dwarfs and Jupiters), which                        
              plausibly might comprise the dark matter in the halo of the                    
              Milky Way galaxy.  In "standard" Big-Bang nucleosynthesis                      
              theory, the presence in the universe of some baryonic dark                     
              matter is required:  this matter could be contained in MACHOs.                 
              The investigators will make photometric measurements on up to                  
              three million Magellanic Cloud (or Galactic Bulge) stars each                  
              night for four years in order to detect the occasional                         
              amplification of these stars by the gravitational microlens                    
              effect.
