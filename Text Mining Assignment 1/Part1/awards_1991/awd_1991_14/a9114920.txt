Abstract    :
              This Science in Developing Countries award supports collaboration              
              between James Gill of the University of California at Santa Cruz               
              and Eduardo Malavassi of the Universidad Nacional in Costa Rica.               
              The project aims to test the investigators' hypothesis that a                  
              recently discovered geodynamic discontinuity in central Costa                  
              Rica has a fundamental influence on the chemical composition of                
              magmas there.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Circum-Pacific magmatism causes most of the earth's volcanic                   
              hazards and is the chief mechanism for maintaining and                         
              reprocessing the earth's crust.  The magma's origins are poorly                
              understood.  The Nicaragua-Costa Rica sector of the Central                    
              American volcanic arc constitutes an important natural laboratory              
              for studying the nature of and reasons for spatial and temporal                
              variations in the composition of young volcanic rocks.  This                   
              project will lead to insights into the magma-forming process at                
              arcs, a vital topic in volcanology.  The researchers will collect              
              and prepare recent volcanic rocks in Costa Rica and perform                    
              labwork in the United States.  The Costa Rican research has                    
              expertise in the collection, selection, and preparation of                     
              samples specific to Costa Rica.  The U.S. researcher, a world                  
              expert in arc volcanoes, will provide SRF and mass spectrometry                
              isotope analysis, capabilities which Costa Rica lacks.
