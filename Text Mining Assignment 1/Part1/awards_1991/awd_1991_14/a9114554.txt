Abstract    :
                   This research develops improved statistical methods for both              
              planning and analyzing robust design experiments.  A new experiment            
              format, the combine array format, will be developed to reduce the              
              experiment size and allow greater flexibility for estimating                   
              effects which may be more important for physical reasons.  Design              
              strategies, alternative graphical tools and tables, and computer               
              algorithms will also be developed to help engineers plan more                  
              efficient experiments themselves.  For analyzing experiments, the              
              response model approach will be developed to yield additional                  
              information about how control parameter settings dampen the effects            
              of individual noise parameters.  Alternative variability measures              
              for Taguchi's signal-to-noise ratios and methods for empirically               
              determining the appropriate measure to use will also be developed.             
                   The impact of this research is expected to be significant in              
              terms of expanding the science base of techniques for improving                
              product quality, manufacturability and reliability at low cost.
