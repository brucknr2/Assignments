Abstract    :
                   The study of cycles in graphs has long been a central theme               
              in graph theory and combinatorics research.  A problem that                    
              traces its roots to the 1850's is that of determining when a                   
              graph G contains a cycle which traverses all the vertices of G                 
              exactly once.  Named after William Hamilton, those cycles are                  
              better known as Hamiltonian cycles.  Not only is this a                        
              structurally interesting problem, but also Hamiltonian cycles,                 
              and cycles in networks in general, have important applications in              
              scheduling, sorting, and even facility design.                                 
                   This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research                   
              Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on Hamiltonian Graphs to               
              be held  May 26-30, 1992 at the University of Louisville.                      
              Professor Roland Haggkvist of the University of Umea (Sweden)                  
              will be the principal lecturer.  To stimulate interest and                     
              activity in mathematical research, the National Science                        
              Foundation each year supports a number of NSF-CBMS Regional                    
              Research Conferences in the Mathematical Sciences.  Each five-day              
              conference features a distinguished lecturer who delivers ten                  
              lectures on a topic of important current research in one sharply               
              focused area of the mathematical sciences.  The lecturer                       
              subsequently prepares an expository monograph based upon these                 
              lectures, which is normally published by the American                          
              Mathematical Society or the Society for Industrial and Applied                 
              Mathematics, or jointly by the American Statistical Association                
              and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.  Certain features                
              differentiate these conferences from typical research                          
              conferences.  These are: (1) Focus on a single important and                   
              timely area of research by a leading practitioner, (2) Continued               
              effect and local stimulation through regional emphasis, (3) Panel              
              review for quality, breadth, and timeliness, and (4) Published                 
              monographs for a wider audience.
