Abstract    :
              A locally testable language is a language with the property that, for          
              some nonnegative integer k, whether or not a word x is in the language         
              depends on (1) the prefix and suffix of x of length k, and (2) the set         
              of substrings occur and to the number of times each substring occurs.          
              The order of a locally testable language is the smallest such k.               
              Locally testable languages and related problems will be investigated.          
              In particular, the objectives are:  (1) improve the time complexity of         
              the approximation algorithm for computing the order of a locally               
              testable automaton; (2) find a tight upper bound on the order of a             
              locally testable deterministic automaton with n states; (3) resolve            
              Robert Martin's conjecture on the problem of feedback-shift-register           
              realizability of a sequential machine, (4) investigate two dimensional         
              locally testable languages and parsers.
