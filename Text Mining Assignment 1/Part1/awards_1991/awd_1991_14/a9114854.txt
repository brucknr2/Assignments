Abstract    :
              Object-oriented systems exhibit a very high rate of object creation,           
              but most of the objects are short-lived.  As a result, memory-                 
              management overhead is significant.  This project is concerned with            
              an application-specific coprocessor architecture to speed up object            
              creation and memory reclamation in object-oriented systems.  The               
              architecture supports a bit-vector approach to dynamic storage                 
              allocation and liberation.  Newly created objects reside in a cache            
              which is reference counted.  It is expected that most objects will die         
              before they age out of the cache, drastically reducing the number of           
              references to main memory.  Many existing computer architectures would         
              require only minor compiler modification to incorporate and benefit            
              from this coprocessor.
