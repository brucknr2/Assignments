Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  This award is to develop a new servo controller architecture              
              for machine tools incorporating the methodologies of variable gain             
              cross-coupling and real time adjustment of apparent axial moment               
              of inertia.  These two approaches have been independently                      
              demonstrated to improve interpolation errors in contour machining.             
              The combining of these methodologies and extending them to multi-              
              axes contouring is a logical and necessary extension of this                   
              research, to achieve higher accuracies while contour machining at              
              normal and high speeds.                                                        
                   This research effort, in close collaboration with                         
              manufacturers of Computer Numerical Control systems, will be of                
              significance to the domestic industrial base while advancing the               
              state-of-art in servo controlled systems applied to manufacturing.
