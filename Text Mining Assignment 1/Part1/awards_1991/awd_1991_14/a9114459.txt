Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary aim of previous research has been to describe, using               
              a constraint based planning strategy, the restructuring of                     
              architectural design problems.  The present project aims to study              
              the rationality of designer' behavior in structuring and especially            
              restructuring design problems.  The research will be performed in              
              five steps.  First, a model of problem structuring in space                    
              planning will be developed using optimization.  To overcome                    
              problems inherent in space planning, such as, continuity of values             
              and size of problem space, dynamic programming techniques will be              
              exploited.  Using model developed in the first step, optimal                   
              solution paths for the given problem structures will be determined.            
                                                                                             
              Protocol data of subjects and simulation program called HeGeL, from            
              previous research, will be used to show factors that explain                   
              subjects' behavior, whether it be optimal, pareto optimal or non-              
              optimal.  A new version of HeGeL, HeGeL-II will be developed                   
              incorporating dynamic programming capabilities developed earlier.              
              The optimality, Pareto optimality or other forms of "rationality"              
              in the paths and solutions used by subjects will be compared                   
              against results obtained in the initial modeling step, using HeGeL-            
              II.  Finally, bounded rationality techniques and strategies for                
              space planning which can be integrated into the designers' process             
              will be proposed.
