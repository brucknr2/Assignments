Abstract    :
              The objective of the workshop is to consider the current state-                
              of-the-art in text analysis, retrieval and understanding, and to               
              draw a plan for how the field of information retrieval can meet                
              the opportunities and challenges of the nineties and beyond.  To               
              achieve this objective, the workshop will bring together                       
              designers and users of information retrieval systems from                      
              academia, industry, and government agencies.  The attendees are                
              drawn from the information retrieval, natural language                         
              processing, and various research communities that represent the                
              emerging technologies like hypertext/hypermedia, large text                    
              databases and dictionaries.  The workshop is expected to identify              
              the most significant technology pull factors that will serve as                
              the driving forces behind the future text processing                           
              technologies.  Furthermore, basic research that should be                      
              fostered to fully exploit these technologies will be identified.               
              The workshop will lead to the preparation of an advisory report                
              containing recommendations for the research community, industry,               
              and funding agencies. It is planned to publish this report in                  
              widely disseminated journals like SIGIR Forum.  In addition, each              
              participant will be required to submit a position paper.  The                  
              position papers will be published as the workshop proceedings.
