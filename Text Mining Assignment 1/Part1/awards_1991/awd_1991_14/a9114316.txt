Abstract    :
                Multi-spacecraft and complementary ground-based observations will            
              be analyzed to understand magnetospheric substorm phenomena and                
              storm-time ring current ions.  Comparisons will be made with                   
              theoretical results of plasma instabilities developed for the                  
              substorm expansion phase.  Data analysis will consist of (1)                   
              determining the substorm growth phase features in the near-earth               
              magnetotail, (2) relating the spatial development of auroral                   
              phenomena to the dawn-dusk and radial extension of substorm                    
              signatures in the magnetosphere, (3) comparing the occurrences of              
              energetic particle bursts in the tail with substorm                            
              intensifications, and (4) assessing the nature of storm-time                   
              transport of ring current ions in the magnetosphere.  The cross-               
              field current instabilities will be studied further including                  
              consideration of equilibrium current arising from density gradient             
              or curvature drift, the effect of multi-ion composition, and its               
              extension from the neutral sheet to the higher latitude portion of             
              the plasma sheet.  The resulting theoretical predictions will be               
              compared with findings obtained from the multi-spacecraft study.
