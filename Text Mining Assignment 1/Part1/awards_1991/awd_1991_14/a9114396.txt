Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to establish a science base             
              for the design and operation of assembly systems.  Specific                    
              objectives are: (1) state-of-the-art branch and bound approach to              
              prescribe minimum cost design and operating decisions, (2) strong              
              cutting plane methods to prescribe minimum cost solutions for                  
              large-scale assembly systems, (3) computational evaluation, and (4)            
              interaction with industry to assure research relevancy.                        
                   Research significance is two-fold.  First, it will improve                
              competitiveness of assembly systems, reducing costs and promoting              
              on-time delivery.  Second, it represents an innovative contribution            
              to integer programming methods and entails basic research to lay               
              a foundation for numerous engineering applications.
