Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     This is a project to initiate a field program to determine             
              the pattern of strain accumulation across the Juan de Fuca ridge               
              by establishing and repeatedly resurveying a network of                        
              benchmarks in the vicinity of the ridge crest. the system                      
              involves interrogation of precision acooustic transponders from a              
              near.bottom towed survey vehicle and use of the resulting range                
              measurements to determine the internal geometry of the array.
