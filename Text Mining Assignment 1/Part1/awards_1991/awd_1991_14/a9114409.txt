Abstract    :
              This grant supports continued studies of the earth's ionosphere                
              and plasmasphere.  The proposed tasks for the next three years                 
              again concentrate on the subauroral and high latitude ionospheres              
              and are a natural continuation and extension of past work.  It                 
              is planned to expand the studies of the subauroral ionosphere                  
              with investigations into (1) the evolution of high altitude                    
              subauroral ion and electron heat flows during magnetic storms,                 
              (2) the aeronomical effects of observed soft electron and soft                 
              ion precipitation peaks, (3) processes responsible for ion and                 
              electron precipitation in this region, and (4) magnetospheric                  
              emissions triggered by ionospheric coupling.  Planned studies of               
              ion outflows, encompassing both high- and mid-latitude regions,                
              include: (1) physical processes responsible for He+-dominated ion              
              outflows, and (2) mid-latitude heavy ion upwelling events.
