Abstract    :
                   The primary research objective is to develop a framework based            
              on the recently discovered differential equation approach for                  
              solving motion related problems that arise in manufacturing                    
              automation.  It is of particular interest to produce an advance in             
              the theory of swept volumes, which will lead to improved means of              
              representing and analyzing sweeps and swept volumes that occur in              
              numerically controlled (NC) machining, robot manipulation, etc.                
              Also of interest is to investigate the full potential of the                   
              differential equation approach as a tool for characterizing                    
              intersections of swept volumes, which leads to solutions for                   
              collision detection and other motion planning problems.                        
                   The method will be applied to program verification and motion             
              planning problems in NC machining and robotics.  The tasks include             
              identification of classes of sweeps, characterization of                       
              singularities in swept volumes and detection of collision with                 
              obstacles (both static and dynamic).  The project will include work            
              on implementing the results for practical applications.
