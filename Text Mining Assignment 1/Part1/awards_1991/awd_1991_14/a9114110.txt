Abstract    :
              The revised project scope is for a 12-month investigation of the               
              SYSTEM performance utilizing a WM processor.  In particular, the               
              investigation is to examine "two potential bottlenecks of WM                   
              systems, namely memory bandwidth and operating system overhead--               
              especially context switching".  Because superscalar and                        
              superpipelined processors are memory "bandwidth hungry" (in the                
              case of the WM processor up to 11 memory references can be                     
              generated per processor cycle)--there is a need to examine the                 
              memory system required to support such a processor.  An instruction            
              cache can only eliminate one of these references, while for vector             
              strides other than one a data cache may actually REDUCE the                    
              effective bandwidth.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Due to the large amount of internal state which an implementation              
              of the WM processor might have (greater than 700 bytes)--the cost              
              of a context switch becomes very high as all of this context must              
              be saved (typically off-chip as most of the on-chip real-estate is             
              filled with registers, cache,...).                                             
                                                                                             
              The investigators will explore several design alternatives to                  
              address each of these areas in order to determine if it is feasible            
              to build a high-performance SYSTEM utilizing a WM processor.
