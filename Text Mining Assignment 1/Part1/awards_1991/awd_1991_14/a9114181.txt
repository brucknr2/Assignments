Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program is made to Dr. Frederick C. Sauls of the Chemistry                     
              Department, King's College, for research on precursors to mixed                
              titanium and aluminum nitride ceramics.  Titanium and                          
              titanium-aluminum compounds with amide and hydrazide bridging                  
              groups will be prepared and characterized using NMR, ESR, X-ray                
              diffraction and electron microscopy.  Oligomeric and polymeric                 
              aluminum- and titanium-containing species and mixed-metal                      
              compounds will be pyrolyzed to form the ceramics.  The research                
              will be done in collaboration with Dr. Leonard V. Interrante of                
              the Chemistry Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

              Ceramic materials containing titanium and aluminum nitride have                
              potential as semiconductors and abrasives.  Although some                      
              materials of this type have been prepared by carbothermal                      
              reduction and by sputtering techniques, they have not been                     
              obtained by pyrolysis of an orgamometallic precursor, a method                 
              which has been shown effective in preparing high purity                        
              non-oxide ceramics of controlled composition.  In this                         
              research, suitable precursors will be prepared and their                       
              behavior upon pyrolysis will be studied.  Fundamental                          
              information on bonding between titanium and aluminum and                       
              nitrogen will also be obtained.
