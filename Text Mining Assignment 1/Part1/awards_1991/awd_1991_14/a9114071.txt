Abstract    :
                   The Advanced Study Institute on Techniques and Concepts                   
              of High Energy Physics will be held at St. Croix from July 15                  
              to July 26, 1992.  Approximately 60 advanced graduate students                 
              and research associates will attend lectures by nine leaders                   
              in experimental and particle physics.                                          
                   This action will provide funds for lecturers to travel to                 
              the Institute.  The course material for the Institute can be                   
              divided into three general areas.  The first is concerned with                 
              the experimental tools of the field; the second involves the                   
              confrontation between the latest experimental results and the                  
              phenomenology; and the third will involve the theoretical                      
              underpinnings of the Standard Model.  In addition, selected                    
              students, faculty or visitors will present brief seminars on                   
              subjects related to the main lectures.
