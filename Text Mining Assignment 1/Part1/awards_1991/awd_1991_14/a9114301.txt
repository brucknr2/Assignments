Abstract    :
                   This action is to allow the investigator, Dr. Joaquin                     
              Fuster, to purchase computer equipment to support an innovative                
              focus of his research.  The overall objective of his research is               
              to gain understanding of the neural foundation of perception and               
              memory.  It is designed to provide new data concerning the                     
              processes by which the brain of the primate encodes, retains, and              
              utilizes information acquired by active touch.  The principal and              
              most innovative aspects of this research is the in-depth                       
              computational analysis of temporal patterns of neuron discharge                
              during haptic discrimination and short-term memory.  This work is              
              important because it builds on previous models of memory and                   
              pushes it to the cutting edge by the addition of computational                 
              methodology.
