Abstract    :
              The ice cover in the Arctic Ocean plays an important role in                   
              the global climate by controlling exchange of momentum and heat                
              between the atmosphere and the ocean.  Ice distribution defines                
              not only the heat balance but it also influences the oceanic                   
              density distribution through the brine rejection during the cold               
              season, and ice melting during the warm season.  The strong                    
              processes of exchanging moisture and heat between atmosphere and               
              water occur at the pack-ice openings.  This project is part of a               
              systematic study of the Arctic environment and its role in global              
              change which is promoted by NSF's Arctic System Science Program.               
              It is a two year project to utilize data sets existing in the                  
              Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia                
              with existing and refined models of increased sensitivity to                   
              evaluate the effect of tides on ice production and ice-ocean                   
              interaction.  This research will investigate four basic tidal                  
              constituents, with space resolution of about 20 kilometers, and                
              the role of tides in sea-ice lead formation.
