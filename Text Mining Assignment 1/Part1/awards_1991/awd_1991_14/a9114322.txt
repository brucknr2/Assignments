Abstract    :
                   The funding partially supports the "Transport Phenomena in                
              Processing" conference being organized in Hawaii, March 1992.  The             
              objective of the conference is to address many of the barrier                  
              transport issues e.g., heat transfer, mass transfer, chemical                  
              reactions, fluid flow, and micro mecha-nics of transport phenomena             
              in processing of advanced materials.  The topics addressed will                
              include processing issues in polymer composites, crystal growth and            
              advanced electronic materials, micro-mechanical issues in transport            
              phenomena, chemical vapor deposition, ceramics and ceramic matrix              
              composites, and computer-aided process analysis and simulation.                
                   A better understanding of the underlying science related to               
              the improvement of materials processing will allow for the                     
              development of more productive and efficient manufacturing.
