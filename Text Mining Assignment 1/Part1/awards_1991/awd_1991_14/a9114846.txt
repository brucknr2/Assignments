Abstract    :
                   Cavity filling in die casting represents an example of free               
              surface fluid flow that is important in manufacturing.  The                    
              investigators have developed a new method for the numerical                    
              simulation of transient, two-dimensional, incompressible, free                 
              surface fluid flow that introduces the use of surface markers and              
              micro cells.  In this project, the validity of this new simulation             
              method will be demonstrated by comparisons of numerical solutions              
              with real fluid behavior.                                                      
                   The cavity filling simulation will be extended to include heat            
              transfer and temperature dependent viscosity effects and to include            
              surface tension and to accommodate curvilinear geometry.  The                  
              extended simulation will be used in conjunction with the existing              
              simulation and the flow visualization results to investigate the               
              influence of heat transfer, temperature dependent viscosity, and               
              surface tension on cavity filling.
