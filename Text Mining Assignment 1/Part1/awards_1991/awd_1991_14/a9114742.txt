Abstract    :
              Transfer phenomena in porous media are involved in several                     
              fields of considerable practical importance:  geology,                         
              hydrology, chemical engineering, petroleum engineering,                        
              drying, etc.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              An international seminar in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia is being                     
              organized by the International Centre for Heat and Mass                        
              Transfer and sponsored by UNESCO with the objective to present                 
              up-to-date research and to provide a forum for interaction by                  
              the porous media scientists from various parts of the world.                   
              The one-week seminar will feature invited lecturers and                        
              presentations by recognized experts in the field on both                       
              fundamental as well as applied topics.  This travel grant will                 
              enable the PI to present an invited review based on his                        
              contributions on non-Darcy convection in porous media,                         
              research which was previously supported by the National                        
              Science Foundation.
