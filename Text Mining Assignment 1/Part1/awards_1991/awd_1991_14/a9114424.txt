Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A particular concern about the predicted global mean                           
              temperature increase of 1 to 5 Degrees C by the year 2050 is                   
              that in the tropics, where many organisms live near their upper                
              thermal tolerance, even a small increase in temperature could                  
              result in wide-spread mortality of ecologically and/or                         
              economically important species with a consequent change in the                 
              composition and character of tropical ecosystems (Peters and                   
              Darling 1985).  Over the last decade there has been an                         
              increased incidence of so-called coral bleaching (Williams and                 
              Williams 1990, Langreth 1990, Glynn 1991), due to the loss by                  
              scleractinian corals of their algal symbionts or Hoegh-Guldberg                
              and Smith 1989, Kleppel et al. 1989, Szmant and Gassman 1990).                 
              Many of the geographically extensive incidences of bleaching                   
              have followed periods of elevated seawater temperatures (Glynn                 
              1991) and bleaching has been attributed to temperature stress                  
              to either the coral animals and/or their zooxanthellae (which                  
              of the two is not known for certain).  The bleaching events                    
              have been taken by some to indicate that global climate warming                
              has already begun (Roberts 1990), and temperature-sensitive                    
              coral reef cnidarians are being touted as potential important                  
              as indicators of small but real recent increases in seawater                   
              temperatures.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Our ability to causally associate coral bleaching with global                  
              temperature increases is hampered by our lack of understanding                 
              of the fundamental causes and processes of the bleaching                       
              (Gladfelter 1988.  Little is known about the particular                        
              conditions that trigger adaptive response to temperature                       
              increase.  This information is needed to able to interpret                     
              coral bleaching from a global warming perspective, as well as                  
              to predict the long-term consequences of such warming.                         
                                                                                             
              I hereby propose that the detection of heat-shock gene                         
              expression in tropical cnidarians and their algal symbionts may                
              be a viable method for learning more about the temperature                     
              tolerance, physiology and adaptation of these organisms, and                   
              potentially as a monitoring tool for detecting climate change.
