Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Conceptual models of frontal evolution and structure within               
              the curved flow charactestic of extratropical disturbances have                
              grown in number and qualitative complexity, as a result of numerous            
              case-studies of frontal cyclones in a variety of meteorological                
              environments. Keyser will place these models into a formalized,                
              quantitative dynamic context. This will be approached through                  
              diagnoses of the vertical circulations, converging and diverging               
              wind patterns, and potential vorticity fields in objectively                   
              analyzed observed mesoscale fields, and in short-term numerical                
              forecasts using mesoscale numerical models. Distinctive features of            
              the diagnosed fields will be compared to those implicit in the                 
              conceptual models, and to those predicted by idealized dynamical               
              theories. In particular, frontal systems in the central U.S. will              
              be the object of study in order to take advantage of the STORM-                
              Fronts Experiment Systems Test (STORMFEST) to take place in                    
              February and March 1992.
