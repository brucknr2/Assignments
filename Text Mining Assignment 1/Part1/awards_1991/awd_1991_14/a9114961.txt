Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An investigation into the ignition of aluminum-based water slurries            
              by ultrasound is proposed.  This technique may circumscribe the                
              problems associated with atomization and the protective oxide layer            
              on the aluminum particles.  Ultrasound has been shown to be capable            
              of producing temperatures above 3000 K and pressures up to 500 atm             
              due to high speed interparticle collisions.  A 2 kW generator                  
              ducted through a catenary-shaped horn to produce an intensity of               
              20 kW/cm2 will be used to produce an estimated 10 kW thermal power.            
              Ferric oxide will be added to the slurry initially because it will             
              increase the heat release by aluminum oxidation, with the hope of              
              stabilizing the reaction.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The award is made through the SGER program.  It offers the                     
              opportunity to prove the concept of acoustic ignition for                      
              energetic, continuously flowing slurries, which could provide a                
              concentrated energy source producing highly elevated temperatures.
