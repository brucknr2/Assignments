Abstract    :
              During the past decade, the transformation-regeneration of selected            
              plant species has become routine and contributed to the production             
              of improved plant products through genetic engineering.  However,              
              despite a large effort, an efficient system for transformation-                
              regeneration has not been developed for the two most economically              
              important groups of plants, cereals and legumes.  This project                 
              represents a comprehensive and systematic effort to develop such               
              a system for legumes, using soybean as a model experimental system.            
              The investigators, an expert on soybean tissue culture and genetics            
              and an expert in cell biology, will develop a transformation                   
              technology by identifying the cells participating in regeneration.             
              If successful, such a technology will contribute directly to the               
              genetic engineering of legumes, and indirectly to our understanding            
              of the basic mechanisms of plant transformation.
