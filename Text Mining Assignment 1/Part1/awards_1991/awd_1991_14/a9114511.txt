Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a joint project between the University of                      
              Colorado and Atkinson-Noland and Associates, in cooperation                    
              with the Politechnico di Milano and ISMES of Bergauno,                         
              Italy.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The researchers will investigate the structural safety of                      
              unreinforced masonry walls duplicating construction                            
              practices of past years in order to determine the best                         
              methods to repair and retrofit them.
