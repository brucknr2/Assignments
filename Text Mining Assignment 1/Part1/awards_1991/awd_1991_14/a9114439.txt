Abstract    :
              Fracture mechanics of functionally gradient materials and material             
              interfaces and layered orthotropic materials will be studies.  The             
              emphases in the program will be on the fracture related issues in              
              new material systems in which strength, toughness, fatigue and                 
              corrosion properties along with the residual stresses may be                   
              controlled by controlling the composition profile during                       
              processing.  Functionally gradient materials are essentially fine              
              composites or nano composites which are synthesized to achieve a               
              desired thermomechanical property variation in the material by                 
              grading the volume fractions of the constituent materials through              
              the thickness.  This new process of grading the properties of the              
              interfacial regions and coatings by gradually varying the material             
              composition through the thickness appears to have some very                    
              important advantages.  First, the process smooths the stress                   
              distribution and drastically reduces the stress concentration                  
              factors thereby reducing the likelihood of failure due to residual             
              and thermal stresses.  Secondly, it improves the bonding strength,             
              in most cases quite considerably.  The third advantage of the new              
              technique is the improvement one obtains in fracture toughness and             
              fatigue and corrosion crack growth parameters of the material.  The            
              second part of the program deals with the investigation of the                 
              influence of material orthotropy, particularly the structure and               
              thickness of interfacial zones in bonded layers on the crack                   
              driving force in delamination and fracture penetration problems.
