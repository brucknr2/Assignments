Abstract    :
              The objective of this research program is to establish the                     
              relationship between the observable and measurable properties of               
              the fiber-matrix interfacial surface on the micro-scale and the                
              macro-properties (strength and toughness) of a fiber reinforced                
              composite specimen.  The first step in the development of the                  
              proposed three (micro, meso and macro) scale model consists of a               
              scale invariant (fractal) representation of the interfacial surface            
              based on experimental measurements.  Next, all interlock, adhesive             
              and capillary forces are determined on the asperities in actual                
              contact.  These predictions are corroborated by experiments.  Once             
              the statistics of the surface (corresponding to particular                     
              materials and specific processing) and contact forces on the                   
              contact spots are determined it becomes necessary to study the                 
              strength and stability of that system.  The onset of debonding                 
              and/or frictional slip is determined applying the percolation                  
              theory and self-organizing criticality.  All phases of this program            
              will be mutually consistent.  Geometry and physics of the                      
              underlying physical phenomena will be rigorously treated.
