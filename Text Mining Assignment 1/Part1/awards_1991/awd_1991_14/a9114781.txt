Abstract    :
              Experimental and analytical studies will be made of the response               
              of elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubricants to the very high shear rates            
              and pressures which are encountered in EHD lubrication, using                  
              comparable, very short time scales.  New techniques have been                  
              developed to measure the dynamic compressibility and the response              
              to dynamic shearing, by extending the torsional Kolsky bar and                 
              pressure-shear plate impact techniques.  These techniques will be              
              combined with analytical analyses to reevaluate the concept of                 
              limiting shear stress in liquid lubricants and to investigate the              
              possibility that shear flow localization in the EHD lubricant may              
              play an important role in EHD lubrication.
