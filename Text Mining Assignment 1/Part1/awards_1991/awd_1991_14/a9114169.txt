Abstract    :
              Reliable dating techniques for young (< 1 million year old) mid-               
              ocean ridge basalts must be established to understand the space and            
              time scales of magma supply, fractination and eruption, and                    
              tectonism along spreading ridges and within distinct segments.                 
              This is an application of step-wise heating 40Ar-39Ar dating                   
              methods to well located, fresh samples the Juan de Fuca, Gorda, and            
              East Pacific Rise spreading ridges.  Many of these samples have                
              been dated by mass spectrometric 238U-230U disequilibrium, and the             
              two techniques will be compared and intercalibrated.
