Abstract    :
                   A laboratory plasma experiment is proposed to investigate the             
              fundamental topology of magnetic reconnection regions and                      
              associated magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) phenomena.  Reconnection is               
              well established as a fundamental process of importance to                     
              understanding the geospace environment, from magnetospheric                    
              substorms and the magnetopause to solar flares.  The proposed                  
              experiment will test whether reconnection is a laminar two-                    
              dimensional process, the model of prevailing theories, or whether              
              three-dimensional structures will spontaneously arise.  A very                 
              flexible double-spheromak configuration is proposed with six                   
              different operating regimes that should have quite different flow              
              patterns, as well as variations in the initial configuration from              
              two-dimensional (with toroidal symmetry) to fully three-                       
              dimensional.  A novel element in reconnection physics that will be             
              tested is the generation of flows along the neutral-line direction             
              which arise for counter-helicity reconnection but not for co-                  
              helicity.  Institutional support for theoretical research will                 
              simulate merging spheromaks with three-dimensional resistive MHD               
              codes and these simulation results will be checked against the                 
              laboratory results.
