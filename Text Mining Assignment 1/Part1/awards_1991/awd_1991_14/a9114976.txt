Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     The purpose of this research is to quantify a mechanism for            
              lateral melt migration beneath mid.ocean ridges; namely freezing               
              induced melt channeling.  Preliminary results suggest that rapid               
              freezing near the sloping base of the lithosphere may lead to the              
              fromation of high permeability m lt channels that allow melt to                
              migrate to the ridge axis.  The questions remaining are: (1) What              
              are the fundamental parameters that control the process? (2) Are               
              channels expected in the earth? (3) What is the efficiency of                  
              this process? (4) What are the observable consequences for volume              
              timing and chemistry of mid.ocean ridge volcanism?  By combining               
              high resolution 2.D magma migration code with large scale thermal              
              and mantle flow models, a systematic series of problems will be                
              investigated to address these questions.
