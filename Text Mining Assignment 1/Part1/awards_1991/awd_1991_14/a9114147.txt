              This award supports Professor Herbert Moskowitz of Purdue                      
              University to collaborate in Social Science research with                      
              several international scholars from the UK, Turkey and Finland                 
              who bring a variety of useful and complementary expertise in                   
              applied mathematics, statistics, management science, decision                  
              theory and economics to this interdisciplinary research                        
              project.  The participating experts are Professor Derek Bunn,                  
              Chairman of Decision Sciences, London Business School;                         
              Professor Murat Koksalan, Department of Industrial                             
              Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey;                 
              and Professors Pekka Korhonen and Jyrki Wallenius of the                       
              Helsinki School of Economics.  They plan to investigate                        
              promising theoretical, methodological and applied research in                  
              multiple criteria decision making and decision analysis.                       
              Among other topics in these fields, they will pursue research                  
              on human choice behavior, fuzzy modeling and analysis of                       
              Quality Function Deployment, and extensions of robust                          
              interactive decision analysis.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This research should provide new insights into several                         
              important issues associated with human decision making and                     
              problem solving.  Potential applications include the                           
              development of improved decision making software for business                  
              and industrial management.
