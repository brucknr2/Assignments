Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The International Conference on Separations Technology will be                 
              held in Hawaii, U.S., October 20-25, 1991.  The conference,                    
              sponsored by the Engineering Foundation, will bring together                   
              scientists and engineers drawn about 50% from the United                       
              States and 50% from the Pacific Rim countries, Europe and the                  
              rest of the world.  The format of the conferences is eight                     
              half-day oral sessions, covering five days, along with the                     
              poster sessions.  About 32 invited papers will be presented                    
              orally, along with at least as many posters.                                   
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this conference are threefold:  1) to                        
              disseminate the latest research results; 2) to define the                      
              direction of future separations research; and 3) to promote                    
              U.S. and other countries dialogues and collaboration in                        
              various important separation research areas.  The conference                   
              is of considerable importance to the U.S. for a least two                      
              reasons.  First, separations are crucial to a number of the                    
              most pressing needs and opportunities for the U.S., including                  
              development of alternative sources of energy and chemicals;                    
              protecting and improving the environment; commercial                           
              development of biotechnology; reduced dependence upon foreign                  
              sources of critical minerals and metals; and achieving the                     
              high degrees of purification needed for electronic materials,                  
              food, and pharmaceuticals.  Secondly, there is much forefront                  
              research in Japan, Australia and in Europe on separations, and                 
              the conference affords, and the conference affords U.S.                        
              scientists and engineers the opportunity to learn about and                    
              utilize these developments.
