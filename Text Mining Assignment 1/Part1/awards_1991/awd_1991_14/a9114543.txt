Abstract    :
              This proposal intends to build upon the research program on                    
              conventional concrete and continue forward to study high-Strength              
              concrete.  By testing concrete materials of strengths ranging from             
              3,000 psi to 12,000 psi, the effect of increasing concrete strength            
              on the softening of concrete can be evaluated, and the new material            
              laws can be derived. The proposed study will concentrate on                    
              concrete material of 12,000 psi.  By comparing the shear panel                 
              behavior of high-strength and conventional concrete, it will be                
              possible to identify the physical factors that account for                     
              differences in their behavior.  One of the factors to be studied               
              is the aggregate interlock.  Particular attention will be given to             
              the effect of the orientation of reinforcement on the energy                   
              dissipating capacity of reinforced high-strength concrete.
