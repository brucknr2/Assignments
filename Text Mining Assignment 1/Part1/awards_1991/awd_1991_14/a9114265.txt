Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Drs. Jackson                   
              and Kahr will assemble and characterize a series of                            
              triarymethyls and their metal ion complexes. Diradical                         
              cryptands will also be synthesized to isolate the pairwise                     
              electronic interactions that are responsible for magnetic order                
              in the extended materials. Their collaborative study will                      
              address structural and theoretical features that relate to                     
              magnetic coupling and will probe the requirements for design of                
              molecular solids with long-range structure.

              Simple organic paramagnets have been thoroughly studied during                 
              the past 30 years, and their magnetic characteristics can be                   
              analyzed adequately via application of current theory. However,                
              the origins of collective magnetic properties, such as common                  
              ferromagnetism, are incompletely understood. Drs. Jackson and                  
              Kahr have designed approaches to the synthesis of new organic                  
              ferromagnetic materials that are likely to possess novel                       
              magnetic properties. The new materials that are likely to                      
              result upon completion of this research have potential                         
              application for the development of improved information storage                
              and retrieval systems.
