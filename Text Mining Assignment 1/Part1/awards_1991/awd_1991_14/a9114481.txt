Abstract    :
                   This grant provides infrastructure support for the                        
              development of the research and educational activities of the                  
              Center for Minorities in Information Processing Systems at                     
              the City College of CUNY.  The support includes computing and                  
              VLSI laboratory equipment and software, undergraduate and                      
              graduate student assistantships, faculty release time, and                     
              student tutoring.  The principal investigators will conduct                    
              research in (1) image analysis, (2) simultaneous projection                    
              algorithms for set-theoretic signal recovery, (3) automata,                    
              group representations, and Fourier transforms, (4) parallel                    
              algorithms for computer vision and Monte Carlo methods, (5)                    
              VLSI implementations, (6) a transformation kernel for                          
              parallel programming, and (7) image warping.  Educational                      
              activities include the restructuring of special sections of                    
              the first course in computer science as "collaborative                         
              learning communities" as part of an innovative approach to                     
              problem solving and software design.//
