Abstract    :
              This research advances several new directions for current-mode (I-             
              mode) analog integrated circuits.  I-mode circuits potentially                 
              operate at high frequencies using low power supply voltages because            
              they process current rather than voltage as in conventional or                 
              switched-capacitor signal processing circuits.  Moreover, I-mode               
              circuits do not require precision linear floating capacitors, and              
              are therefore very attractive for implementing mixed-mode signal               
              processing systems in the emerging submicron digital CMOS and/or               
              BiCMOS technologies.                                                           
              Several high-speed high-accuracy current-mode techniques are                   
              considered in the design of a basic analog signal processing block             
              with emphasis on developing techniques suitable for implementation             
              with digital IC technologies using a reduced supply voltage.  A                
              high-gain universal fully differential current mode operational                
              amplifier topology is being used and, in one application, is                   
              extended to implement fully differential switched-current filters              
              with accuracy comparable to switched-capacitor filters.  Several               
              clock-feedthrough cancellation schemes are also suggested.                     
              Finally, a new high-frequency continuous time current-mode                     
              filtering technique will be used.  Frequencies exceeding 100 MHZ               
              appear feasible using a 2 um CMOS technology with higher                       
              frequencies possible using more advanced CMOS and/or BiCMOS                    
              technologies.
