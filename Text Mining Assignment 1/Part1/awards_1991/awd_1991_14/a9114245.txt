Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The cochlea is the receptor organ for hearing in mammals.  One                 
              group of its mechanosensory cells, the inner hair cells, make                  
              unique functional synaptic contacts with auditory sensory neurons              
              that carry information to the brain.  Unlike many other synaptic               
              sites, in the mammalian cochlea a single active zone of one inner              
              hair cell usually constitutes the entire synaptic input to the                 
              afferent neurons, unlike the extensive branching common                        
              elsewhere.  This exploratory project will develop a novel                      
              isolated preparation of the mammalian cochlea to exploit the                   
              unique opportunity to study the physiology of a single synaptic                
              active zone.  Results will be important to our understanding of                
              synaptic mechanisms, and the isolated preparation will provide an              
              important new approach with impact on auditory neuroscience.
