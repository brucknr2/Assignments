Abstract    :
              Harris         The focus of this research is on the design of very large  scale
              integrated circuit structures that can implement the  Ziganirov-Jelenek stack
              algorithm for sequential decoding of long  constraint length codes.  Chips are
              being fabricated using mask  making and foundry facilities available through
              the USC/ISI Mosis  Program.         This research is also focused on the impact
              of stack design  and algorithm performance of factors like the word length of
              the  decoding metric, the length of the stack, and the constraint  length. 
              These results can improve our understanding of the  design of high speed
              sequential decoders.  It will result in  devices that can test decoding
              concepts, and can extend the range  of application of an important technique
              for achieving reliable  communication and high density data storage.
