Abstract    :
              This award supports visits over a three-year period by Dr. Robert              
              T. Mason of Oregon State University to the University of Queens-               
              land, Australia, to work with Dr. Joan Margaret Whittier on                    
              reproduction in the tropical colubrid brown tree snake, Boiga                  
              irregularis, which is native to Australia, New Guinea, and the                 
              Solomon Islands.  During World War II, the snake was introduced                
              onto Guam, where it clearly established itself as a serious threat             
              to native fauna and to humans.  This snake is responsible for the              
              extinction of three species of native birds on Guam, and the                   
              serious declination in the populations of most, if not all,                    
              remaining small vertebrates on the island.  B. irregularis is a                
              prolific colonizer and it has now been found on several additional             
              islands, including Hawaii.  Little is known of the biology in                  
              general of these snakes.  Of particular importance in terms of                 
              managing this emerging threat to Pacific island fauna is the                   
              investigation of the reproductive potential of female brown tree               
              snakes in their natural range in Australia.  Specifically, the                 
              investigators will (1) characterize histologically the cycle of egg            
              and sperm production, and sperm storage; (2) determine by                      
              radioimmunoassay sex steroid hormone secretion in both sexes; and              
              (3) investigate the chemical ecology of these animals by isolating             
              and chemically characterizing potential sex attractant pheromones              
              produced by females.
