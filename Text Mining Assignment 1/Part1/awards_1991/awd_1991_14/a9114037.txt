Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation                
              to study the properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice               
              and biology in the Northeast Water (NEW) Polynya, which occurs                 
              near northeastern Greenland, in order to gain an integrated                    
              understanding of Arctic shelf-slope processes.  This element of                
              the NEW program will measure Tritium as a chemical tracer to                   
              determine how much Atlantic water may be recycled in the region,               
              how effective the gas exchange is through the polynya surface,                 
              and how much ice forms during the freezing season.  Tritium-                   
              helium ages will provide corroborative data for biological                     
              studies directed at determination of oxygen utilization rates, a               
              major concern of the program and therefore serve as important                  
              collaborative input to the NEW Program.
