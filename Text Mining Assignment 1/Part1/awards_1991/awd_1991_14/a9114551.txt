Abstract    :
              This award supports a long-term visit by Dr.                                   
              John R. Dickel of the University of Illinois                                   
              Urbana to the Australia Telescope National                                     
              Facility in Sydney to work with Dr. D.K.                                       
              Milne.  Supernova remnants (SNRs) are an                                       
              important link between the stars and the                                       
              interstellar medium.  An important                                             
              contribution to understanding these objects                                    
              can be made by radio observations of a sample                                  
              of SNRs in our neighboring galaxy, the Large                                   
              Magellanic Cloud.  Only the newly commissioned                                 
              Australia Telescope has the capability to make                                 
              such observations of this southern galaxy.
