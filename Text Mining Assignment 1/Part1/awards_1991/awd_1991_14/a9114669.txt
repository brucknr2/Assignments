Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This grant will support the improvement of insect                         
              collections at the Bohart Museum of Entomology (BME).  In                      
              conjunction with the transfer of holdings to a new, climate-                   
              controlled building, mobile compactor system for the pinned                    
              collection will be installed, and  parts of the collection will                
              be rehoused in new cabinets and trays.  The BME boasts the 3rd                 
              largest university-held insect collections in the US, with more                
              than 6 million specimens and 1500 primary types.  Geographic                   
              representation is worldwide, with particular holdings from                     
              Australia and the Western Hemisphere. Its taxonomic strength is                
              in Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Homoptera, Coleoptera, Strepsiptera,              
              Acarina and Tardigrada.  Collection improvement now is timely,                 
              given the move to new quarters, and is especially appropriate for              
              long-term conservation given the collection's substandard                      
              housing.  The collection is used broadly in systematic research                
              and teaching, and this project will increase access to and use of              
              the collection by the research community and in training students              
              in environmental biology.
