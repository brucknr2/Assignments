Abstract    :
              In 1987, the Engineering Foundation Conference on Composite                    
              Construction was held in Henniker, New Hampshire.  Composite                   
              Construction II, a continuation of the 1987 conference, is                     
              organized to fulfill the intent of the 1987 resolution, and to                 
              again provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners form            
              around the world to meet and exchange vital information in this                
              fast developing area of engineering practice.  The conference will             
              be limited to approximately 100 participants, with one-half of the             
              participants invited from abroad, and will cover all phases of                 
              design, construction and research related to composite steel-                  
              concrete structures.  Repair and strengthening of existing                     
              structures, as well as new construction will be discussed.                     
              Composite Construction II will provide an exciting opportunity for             
              an international exchange of ideas that will benefit the structural            
              engineering and construction fields both inside and outside of the             
              U.S.
