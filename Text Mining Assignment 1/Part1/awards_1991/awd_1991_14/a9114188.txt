Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the analysis and experimental                    
              verification for the use of pultruded fiber reinforced plastic                 
              (FRP) in slabs of concrete.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The project will be cost shared by several industries and the                  
              Federal Highway Administration.
