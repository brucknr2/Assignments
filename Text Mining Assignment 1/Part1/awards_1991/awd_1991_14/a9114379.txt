Abstract    :
              The 19th Rare Earth Research Conference (RERC) will be held in                 
              Lexington, Kentucky, July 14-19, 1991.  This project will provide              
              partial support for (1) domestic travel expenses for invited                   
              foreign speakers and a few foreign Session Chairs/Plenary Lecturers            
              with special financial need (priority for support will be given to             
              invited speakers from Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, India, and             
              other third world countries), and (2) stipends for travel support              
              of U.S. citizens who are graduate students or junior investigators             
              in the general area of rare earth and actinide research, and who               
              have financial difficulties in attending the Conference.  The RERCs            
              are international forums normally held in the U.S. to promote                  
              exchange of information in general areas of pure and applied                   
              research and various applied technologies involving rare earth and             
              actinide elements.  Broad-scale participation from universities,               
              industrial  concerns, and national laboratories is purposefully                
              sought, encouraging cross-disciplinary exchanges and technology                
              transfer.
