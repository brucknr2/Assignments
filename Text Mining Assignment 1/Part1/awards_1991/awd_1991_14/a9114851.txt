Abstract    :
              The tribological behavior of Al-SiC metal matrix composites                    
              sliding against hardened steel will be studied.  The wear                      
              behavior of the composites and of the steel counterface                        
              will be determined and related to microstructure.  The                         
              results will be used to validate a statistical model to be                     
              developed for the wear rate.  The model will be based on a                     
              theory of random clumping of the hard particles in the                         
              aluminum matrix and on the assumption that the wear of the                     
              steel is abrasive in nature and caused by the hard phase in                    
              the composite.
