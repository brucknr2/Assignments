Abstract    :
              This is a travel award for an exploratory visit to the MIT to                  
              visit faculty and examine facilities.  Initial contacts have been              
              made with Dr. Graham Walker, who has expressed an interest in                  
              serving as postdoctoral mentor.  This travel award will enable                 
              the investigator to meet with other members of the department and              
              to become familiar with the laboratory holdings and library                    
              facilities as well.  Initial discussions of possible arrangements              
              for a postdoctoral appointment will also be held.
