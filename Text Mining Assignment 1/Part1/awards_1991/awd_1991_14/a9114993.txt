Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Persian Gulf situation presents a unique opportunity to               
              assess the impact of massive fossil fuel fires on the atmosphere.              
              In particular, measurements of the effects on cloud and                        
              precipitation processes, radiation, and atmospheric chemistry                  
              would provide data that could be used in cloud physics, climate,               
              global change, and air pollution research.                                     
                   The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the               
              University of Washington have developed a plan, with university                
              and Federal scientists, to mount an initial intensive                          
              observational program by one or two aircraft during a four-week                
              period in May and June.  The scientific objectives of the program              
              are:                                                                           
                                                                                             
                   o  To characterize the regional emission rates of the fires.              
                                                                                             
                   o  To measure radiative properties of the smoke, and the net              
                   radiative effects of the plumes.                                          
                                                                                             
                   o  To measure characteristics of the smoke particles and                  
                   determine if the particles have a hygroscopic component.                  
                                                                                             
                   o  To determine the effects of the smoke on the composition               
                   and radiative properties of clouds.                                       
                                                                                             
                   o  To measure the chemical composition of the plume and                   
                   determine how that composition changes with time.                         
                                                                                             
                   o  To study regional weather anomalies associated with these              
                   smoke emissions.                                                          
                                                                                             
                   The proposed observational equipment will include the                     
              University of Washington Convair C-131A and/or NCAR Electra.                   
                   In addition to Federal support for this effort, Gilbert                   
              Grosvenor, President of the National Geographic Society, has                   
              contacted NSF to provide some support for this project.
