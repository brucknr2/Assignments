Abstract    :
              This award supports one trip per year, over three years, to                    
              Australia by Dr. Pratsinis.  At the University of Queensland,                  
              Department of Chemical Engineering, he will work with Dr. James                
              D. Litster, bringing together two scientists from different                    
              perspectives:  The U.S. PI works with ultrafine particles in                   
              gases, the Australian with fine particles in liquids and gases.                
              The former has recently developed new approaches to accurate                   
              solutions of the population balance equation, which the latter is              
              applying to develop control schemes for the particulate industry.              
                                                                                             
              The project should result in new modelling techniques to be                    
              applied to industrially important processes, such as granulation               
              of fertilizers and alumina precipitation.  The models can used to              
              test and optimize processes and control schemes, resulting in                  
              greater productivity and better product quality.
