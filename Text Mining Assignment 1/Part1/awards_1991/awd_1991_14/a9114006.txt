Abstract    :
              The project is to study the                                                    
              full-scale vibration and aerodynamic                                           
              behavior of the new Houston Baytown                                            
              Bridge during various critical                                                 
              stages of construction and after                                               
              completion of the full structure.                                              
              The work includes a series of                                                  
              ambient vibration surveys, a                                                   
              comprehensive ambient survey after                                             
              completion, and a two-year permanent                                           
              installation to assess the                                                     
              performance of the bridge through                                              
              high wind storms.  A plan will be                                              
              developed for a permanent monitoring                                           
              and diagnostic system to be used by

              gathered will be used to validate                                              
              models to predict the behavior of

              conditions.  This knowledge will                                               
              greatly benefit the wind engineering                                           
              community.
