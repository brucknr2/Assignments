Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The solar wind interacts directly with planets whose                      
              intrinsic magnetic fields are too small to protect their                       
              atmospheres and ionospheres.  The research will focus on the                   
              interaction of the solar wind with non-magnetic solar system                   
              bodies such as Venus, Mars, Titan, and comets.  Research in this               
              area contributes to a broader understanding of solar-planetary                 
              relations in general.  The proposed research activity consists of              
              theoretical modeling of the interactions of the solar wind, and                
              other external plasma media, with Venus, Mars, Titan, and comets.              
              Both test particle and magnetohydrodynamical calculations will be              
              undertaken as part of this research effort.
