Abstract    :
              Properties of highly-correlated electrons in metals (heavy-fermion             
              compounds and high-Tc superconducting oxides) will be investigated             
              using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon spin rotation                  
              techniques.  In heavy-fermion compounds and alloys NMR and muon                
              spin rotation studies will be carried out as microscopic probes of             
              the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in these                 
              unusual systems.  Systems to be investigated include a uranium                 
              beryllium borides in which substantial alteration of                           
              superconducting-state properties is associated with a boron-induced            
              change of the "Kondo" temperature Tc; and rare earth and actinide              
              silicides, where possible weak magnetic phases in close proximity              
              to the superconducting phase will be studied.  Impurity-induced                
              internal fields due to time-reversal-symmetry-breaking                         
              superconductivity will be searched for in several heavy-fermion                
              superconductors.  La-139 nuclear quadrupole resonance will be used             
              to investigate charge and spin fluctuations in pure and doped                  
              lanthanum copper oxides.  This work involves collaboration with                
              groups at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Paul Scherrer                 
              Institute (PSI) (Switzerland).
