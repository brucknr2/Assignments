Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the development of a                      
              stochastic optimization modeling approach that supports the                    
              evaluation and the analysis of global manufacturing strategies                 
              under uncertainty.  The research project will introduce a                      
              normative model that considers risk and return tradeoffs                       
              throughout the world supply chain network.                                     
                   The sources of uncertainty to be considered include currency              
              fluctuations, market demand variation and price risk.  Tradeoffs               
              occur through corporate taxes and transfer prices; duties and                  
              tariffs; production and transportation costs; the cost of                      
              manufacturing flexibility; global financing costs; and                         
              international pricing differences.  Decisions concerning facility              
              size and location, material flows, product mix, overhead cost                  
              allocation, financing and pricing will be accounted for in the                 
              model framework.
