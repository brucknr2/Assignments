Abstract    :
                   This grant provides infrastructure support for the                        
              development of the research and educational activities of                      
              the Computing Science Research Laboratory (CSRL) at Clark                      
              Atlanta University.  The support includes computing equipment                  
              and software, graduate student assistantships, faculty                         
              release time, and the NSFnet connection.  The principal                        
              investigators will conduct research in (1) software reuse,                     
              (2) interactive multimedia systems, (3) object-oriented                        
              databases, (4) parallel algorithms for network dynamic                         
              programming, (5) neural network implementations, and (6)                       
              parallel algorithms for roots of polynomials.  The                             
              educational component of this project blends undergraduate                     
              and graduate research experiences at CSRL with an existing                     
              educational program funded through ONR which exploits                          
              linkages with local universities, industry, and national                       
              laboratories.//
