Abstract    :
              A major problem in stellar astrophysics has been reconciling the               
              discovery that at least one half of the mature (main sequence)                 
              stars one sees in the skies are actually close double stars, or                
              "binary" stars, whereas stars that are still forming, T Tauri                  
              stars, seem overwhelmingly to be single stars.  Thanks largely to              
              previous NSF-supported work by this Principal Investigator (PI)                
              this discreprancy now seems clearly due to the difficulty of                   
              discovering binarity among very young stars from conventional                  
              spectroscopic techniques.  Working at infrared wavelengths, the PI             
              has used the moon as a "knife edge" to occult (eclipse) pre-main               
              sequence stars in the Taurus region of the sky to determine whether            
              they are single or double stars.  In the last few years he has                 
              found that 13/28 of occulted T Tauri stars are members of double               
              or triple star systems.  The PI proposes to extend this work to                
              T Tauri stars in the Ophiuchus region of the sky as the Moon's                 
              orbit progresses southward over the next few years.  In addition               
              to adding to the statistics of young binary stars, the PI plans                
              to observe some of the occultation events from two locations                   
              simultaneously, Hawaii and Kitt Peak.  This work is expected to                
              clarify the conditions under which solar-type stars form binary                
              stars as opposed to single stars with planetary systems.
