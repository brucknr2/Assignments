Abstract    :
                   This grant supports planning activity to develop a                        
              continuing grant proposal for the Institutional                                
              Infrastructure-Minority Institutions program.  The research                    
              areas of interest include computer vision, digital image                       
              processing, logic design, and microprocessors.   Planning                      
              activities include a review of the curriculum, evaluation of                   
              laboratories and equipment, development of cooperative                         
              relationships with other universities, industry, and national                  
              laboratories, development of the minority graduate education                   
              pipeline, and finally the preparation and submission of a                      
              comprehensive five-year proposal
