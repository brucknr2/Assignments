Abstract    :
                   Yanai proposes to continue his investigations into three                  
              related topics on the dynamics of large scale tropical motions                 
              which focus on their linkage with extratropical disturbances and               
              with clusters of meso-convective scale cloud systems. First, the               
              nature of heat sources to the atmosphere induced by the Tibetan                
              Plateau and their influence on variations of the Asian monsoon are             
              to be further diagnosed. Secondly, the interactions of the 30-60               
              day tropical oscillation and mid-latitude disturbances in the                  
              global flow are to be further studied. Their differences between El            
              Nino and non-El Nino years are now to be explored.  Third, the                 
              roles of downdrafts, mesoscale organization, and vertical wind                 
              shear in the cloud cluster environment are to be analyzed, to ob-              
              tain improved statistical representation of the overall thermo-                
              dynamic and dynamic effects of convective cloud arrays of varying              
              types.                                                                         
                   Yanai has long been a leader in the quantitative analysis of              
              observational data on these topics, and in the conceptual framing              
              of the results into process descriptions that have been incorpora-             
              ted into widely used components of numerical weather prediction and            
              general circulation models. This work should contribute to useful              
              advances in short-range weather prediction, as well as to a deeper             
              understanding of longer-term variations of  major features of the              
              global general circulation.
