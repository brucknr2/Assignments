Abstract    :
              A workshop devoted to current research and new directions for compiler         
              code generation was held at the new International Conference and               
              Research Center for Computer Science, Schloss Dagstuhl, Germany (near          
              Saarbruecken) from May 20 to 24, 1991.  The participants were 30-40            
              researchers who are actively working in this field, and included               
              graduate students embarking on research on this topic.  One third to           
              one half the participants come from North America, and most of the             
              others from Europe.  Both University faculty and industrial                    
              researchers participated.  The purpose of the workshop was to exchange         
              research results, to assess where the outstanding research problems            
              lie, and to have in-depth discussions of the research topics.                  
              This award supplied part of the transportation expenses and                    
              registration fees of those U.S. participants unable to obtain funding          
              from other sources.
