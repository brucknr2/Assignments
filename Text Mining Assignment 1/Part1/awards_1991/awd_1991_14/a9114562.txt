Abstract    :
              The research addresses control design for mechanical systems.                  
              Specifically, the intent is the development of a highly                        
              transparent practical design methodology for the synthesis of                  
              robust controllers for mechanical systems, systems often                       
              characterized by nonlinear differential equations and such                     
              phenomena as friction, saturation, dead zones, backlash and                    
              hysteresis.  The methodology to be developed parallels                         
              Quantitative Feedback Theory and is based on frequency domain                  
              design tools.  Unlike recent new theories of robust control which              
              have emphasized mathematical elegance at the expense of practical              
              design tools, the proposed work has an engineering style and is                
              aimed at developing a realistic, easy to use design tool.  The                 
              research entails both theoretical and experimental work and will               
              include a number of simulation case studies.***//
