Abstract    :
                 The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory is held              
              approximately every eighteen months at sites alternating between               
              the United States and foreign countries.  The 1991 symposium will              
              be held June 24 through June 28 in Budapest, Hungry.                           
                                                                                             
              The areas covered in this symposium will include detection and                 
              estimation theory, coding and modulation, neural nets and                      
              communications, source coding, data compression, storage channels,             
              multi-user comminications, cryptography, data networks, pattern                
              recognition, optical communications, and information theory.                   
                                                                                             
              The proposal requests support partial travel support for US                    
              scientists whose papers have beem selected but who sould without               
              support be unable to attend.  Many of these will be advanced                   
              graduate students.  About 30 awards are anticipated.  The awardees             
              will be chosen by a committee headed by the PI.                                
                                                                                             
              This is one of two such meetings for which the NCR program has a               
              history of providing partical travel support.  The other is the                
              IEEE Communications Theory Workshop.
