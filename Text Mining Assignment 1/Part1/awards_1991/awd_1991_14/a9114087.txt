Abstract    :
              The measurement of magnetic fields in stars is generally difficult             
              unless the field strengths reach very high values that can be                  
              detected from polarizations of their light.   The Principal                    
              Investigator (PI) and collaborators have built a portable imaging              
              CCD spectropolarimeter that permits them to detect even moderate-              
              strength magnetic fields on faint white dwarf stars on large                   
              telescopes located in both hemispheres.  The PI will undertake a               
              survey of magnetic fields in some 200 white dwarfs down to a                   
              limiting strength of 10-30 kilogauss.  These results should permit             
              astronomers to project these magnetic strengths back to times when             
              these stars constituted a normal population of unevolved ("main                
              sequence") stars.  Thus, in this way we may be able to estimate                
              directly the strengths of magnetic fields otherwise hidden below               
              the surfaces of main sequence stars.  The PI will also continue a              
              program to observe white dwarfs in binaries that are in the process            
              of resynchronizing after "nova outbursts" in them some decades ago.            
              Finally, the PI will observe polarization in "Broad Absorption                 
              Line" Active Galactic Nuclei of external galaxies.  These                      
              observations are expected to help us understand the mechanisms                 
              linking quasars and normal galaxies such as the Milky way.
