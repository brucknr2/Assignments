Abstract    :
              The research objectives are to obtain and analyze observations of              
              solar oscillations and long-term solar variability taken at SCLERA             
              (The University of Arizona Santa Catalina Laboratory for                       
              Experimental Relativity by Astrometry) and at Yunnan Observatory               
              near Kunming, China.  The international collaboration has been                 
              organized in order to furnish observations of the Sun covering a               
              sizeable fraction of a day and, consequently, to significantly reduce          
              the otherwise serious effects of false diurnal signals present in the          
              data of a single site.  The observations will be obtained with the             
              SCLERA solar seismographs currently in operation at the                        
              University of Arizona and at Yunnan Observatory.  The set of                   
              facilities offers research and educational opportunities that are at           
              the forefront of solar physics for both U.S. and Chinese scientists            
              through a relatively low-cost ground-based program.  The first                 
              results from the international cooperation are expected to yield               
              improved information about the structure of the interior regions of            
              the Sun and about long-term solar variability, which may have an               
              impact on long-term variations in the Earth's climate.
