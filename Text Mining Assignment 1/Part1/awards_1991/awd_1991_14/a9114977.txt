Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This investigation will study the effect of wind forcing on the                
              mesoscale circulation of the North Atlantic. A linear (harmonic)               
              shallow water numerical model of the North Atlantic will be                    
              implemented and forced with monthly averaged winds from 1984 to                
              1986. The results of the model will be compared to a current meter             
              record in the central/eastern North Atlantic.
