Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's will continue and complete a study of                
              the general circulation in the tropical Atlantic using subsurface              
              acoustic floats.  44 neutrally buoyant SOFAR floats were launched              
              in early 1989, 14 at 800m, 15 at 1800m, and 15 at 3600m,                       
              corresponding respectively to layers of Antarctic Intermediate                 
              Water and Upper and Lower North Atlantic Deep Water.  The array of             
              6 listening stations will be recovered in late 1992, resulting in              
              a 3.5 year data set describing the Lagrangian characteristics of               
              the flow in these important water masses.
