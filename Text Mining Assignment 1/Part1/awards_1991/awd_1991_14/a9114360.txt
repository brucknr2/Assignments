Abstract    :
              A project is to be undertaken to further our understanding of                  
              linear stochastic wave fields, waves which have suffered                       
              sufficient randomizing scatterings or reflections as to lose most              
              coherence.  Such fields are present in applications of                         
              ultrasonics in many modern materials, and on sufficiently long                 
              time scales in most finite elastic bodies, in reverberation rooms              
              for which the application is conventional acoustics, and in                    
              complex irregular structures for which accurate acoustics and                  
              vibrational descriptions have long been sought.  The proposed                  
              project consists of two main thrusts.  Laboratory and analytic                 
              work will be conducted on ultrasonic fields in strongly                        
              heterogeneous but statistically homogeneous media, which special               
              emphasis on applications in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation               
              and on seeking the effects of residual coherence in such fields                
              by demonstration the long-sought phenomenon of classical wave                  
              Anderson Localization.  A second thrust consisting of large scale              
              computational work on the responses of model reverberation rooms               
              will also be conducted, with a view towards better understanding               
              of eigenmode statistics with consequent potential impact on                    
              improved statistical models of the structural acoustics of                     
              complex systems.
