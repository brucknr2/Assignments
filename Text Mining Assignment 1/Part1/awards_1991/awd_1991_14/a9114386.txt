Abstract    :
              Dr. Fisher will initiate three types of investigations of                      
              hydrothermal vent invertebrates with chemoautotrophic                          
              symbionts. These studies will address specific major gaps in                   
              our understanding of the species at 13N on the East Pacific                    
              Rise; the techniques developed will be useful in future                        
              investigations at any hydrothermal vent site with bivalves or                  
              tubeworms.  The first is a determination of the in-situ tube                   
              growth rate of the tubeworm Tevnia jerichonana, and associated                 
              measurements which allow conversion of these measurement to                    
              growth on a weight basis.  The second involves development and                 
              employment of new and modified techniques for physiological                    
              investigations using intact gill preparations (from B.                         
              thermophilus) incubated under pressure as models of intact                     
              animals, and isolated bacterial preparations to study symbiont                 
              physiology.  The third series of experiments are studies of                    
              vestimentiferan symbiont concentration and autotrophic carbon                  
              fixation rate by R. pachyptila symbionts, and expand previous                  
              studies to a second species of vestimentiferan for comparative                 
              purposes.
