Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this research is to develop a general, rigorous            
              approach for robust optimal design.  This methodology will allow               
              a designer to explicitly consider and control the effects of                   
              variability in design variables and parameters on a design.                    
              Variability is defined in terms of tolerances which bracket the                
              variation of fluctuating quantities.  Both linear and nonlinear                
              tolerances analysis will be studied.                                           
                   The methodology for feasibility robustness will be validated              
              by applying it to ten engineering design problems.  The problems               
              will be chosen to provide examples with applicability to a broad               
              spectrum of engineering fields.//
