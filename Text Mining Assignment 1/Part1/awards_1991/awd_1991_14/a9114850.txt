Abstract    :
                   Drs. Mechoso and Arakawa will continue their two primary                  
              research thrusts on fronts.  First, they are investigating                     
              processes which lead to frontal formation and the generation of                
              unstable secondary waves on fronts, particularly in the middle and             
              upper troposphere.  Second, they are developing new numerical                  
              methods suitable for the study of frontal phenomena.  Previous work            
              by the investigators now leads to the specific consideration of                
              several topics:  (1) the comparative advantages and disadvantages              
              of models which use relative pressure (.) as the vertical                      
              coordinate and those which use potential temperature ();  (2) the             
              origin and evolution of small-scale disturbances on fronts;  (3)               
              the role of diabatic processes in frontogenesis;  and (4) the                  
              development of primitive-equation models with a vertical coordinate            
              that gradually changes from . at the surface to  at upper levels.             
                   Under their previous grant, the principal investigators made              
              considerable progress in their work on the development of large                
              scale models capable of resolving frontogenetic processes.  They               
              have also succeeded in addressing some of the fundamental questions            
              about these processes.  Their research ultimately will contribute              
              to the improvement of operational weather forecast models.
