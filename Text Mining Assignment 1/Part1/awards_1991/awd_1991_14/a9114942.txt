Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative                      
              research project between Professor Fred Anson, Department of                   
              Chemistry, California Institute of Technology, and Professor                   
              Eishun Tsuchida, Department of Polymer Chemistry, Waseda                       
              University, Tokyo, Japan.  The research will focus on                          
              electrochemistry in polymer films on electrode surfaces.                       
                                                                                             
              Professor Anson's research group will perform electrochemical                  
              measurements on solutions of soluble polymers and polyelectrolytes             
              as well as polymeric coatings on electrode surfaces in which                   
              electroactive species are incorporated.  Catalysis of electron                 
              transfer reactions at electrodes and charge propagation rates in               
              coatings are among the objectives of the research.  Professor                  
              Tsuchida's group will prepare and characterize the novel polymer               
              and polyelectrolyte samples that are to be tested by the Anson                 
              group.  Both groups will be concerned with the mechanism and                   
              optimization of the oxidative homogeneous polymerization and                   
              electropolymerization of thiophenols and diaryldisulfides.  The                
              collaboration will bring novel polymers and monomers into                      
              Professor Anson's program and will bring additional                            
              electrochemical expertise into Professor Tsuchida's program.
