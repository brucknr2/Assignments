Abstract    :
              The analysis and design of structures for earthquake resistance                
              requires reliable estimates of the ground shaking expected at the              
              site.  Current procedures for the evaluation of these seismic                  
              ground motion characteristics tend to be empirical and result in               
              estimates that are restricted to the particular earthquake and                 
              site for which they were developed.  The results of such analyses              
              therefore may not be suitable for general seismic response                     
              analyses of structures.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This research program addresses the task of establishing reliable              
              estimates for the description parameters that influence the                    
              seismic motions at a site.  The multitude of recorded earthquake               
              data at SMART-1 (Strong Motion Array in Taiwan-1) and the newly                
              developed techniques for decomposing the motions into their                    
              dominant wave components is used for this purpose.  The analysis               
              of the dominant wave characteristics at the site for a number of               
              earthquakes provides a basis with which to evaluate general                    
              expressions for the stochastic characteristics of the seismic                  
              motions (power and cross spectral densities of the motions in                  
              three orthogonal directions, their rotational components and                   
              their spatial variability).  The development of attenuation                    
              equations that relate the stochastic descriptions of the motions               
              with the earthquake and site characteristics is being explored.
