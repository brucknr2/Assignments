Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant will support experimental research on the effect of                 
              compressibility on mixing between co-flowing streams.                          
              Convective Mach numbers in the mixing layers will vary from                    
              low to as high as 3.  The geometrical features and their                       
              evolution and interactions will be studied, with optical                       
              diagnostics including planar Rayleigh scattering and planar                    
              laser-induced flurescence.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Mixing between two streams is known to be degraded at high                     
              relative flow velocites, but the reason is not yet understood.                 
              Understanding and control of high speed mixing layers is of                    
              crucial importance in combustion and propulsion systems.//
