Abstract    :
              It is proposed to explore the possibility that the research on                 
              oligomers and polymers of ?1.1.1! propellane that we have been                 
              engaged in for the past four years opened an interesting                       
              opportunity in the area of surface science: generation of an imaged            
              organic thin film of a tough and extremely insoluble transparent               
              polymeric coating of controlled thickness and very low dielectric              
              constant on a flat or a profiled surface of any water-insoluble                
              substrate, with a hydrophobic or a hydrophilic, smooth or rough                
              outer surface as desired.  Such a coating would be of potential                
              industrial interest, e.g., in the electronics industry.
