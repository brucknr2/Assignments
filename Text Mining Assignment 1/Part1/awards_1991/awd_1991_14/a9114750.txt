Abstract    :
                   During the past 2 decades, there has been increasing use of               
              multielemental analytical methods to characterize airborne                     
              particulate matter and collected precipitation.  With the                      
              availability of these large multivariate data sets and new                     
              multivariate statistical methods that have been made practical by              
              the continuing increases in computer size and speed, there is an               
              enhanced opportunity to extract information about atmospheric                  
              processes from data characterizing collected particles or                      
              precipitation.   The original objective of this on-going research              
              program was to continue the examination of the statistical                     
              problems associated with the source identification and mass                    
              apportionment of urban aerosols.  During the current grant                     
              period, the program has changed its emphasis toward larger scale               
              phenomena and the development and testing of statistical methods               
              to extract information from analyzed samples obtained on a larger              
              spatial and temporal scale.  Specifically, the PI proposes to                  
              validate the Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF)                     
              analysis and Total Potential Source Contribution Function (TPSCF)              
              analysis Techniques both by applying PSCF to small-scale data                  
              sets and applying PSCF to the Across North America Tracer                      
              Experiment (ANATEX) data where the location and quantities of                  
              source emissions are known, to study  and further develop three-               
              way modeling via the application of existing methods to                        
              additional data sets and an investigation into alterations that                
              may be necessary to these methods in the presence of constraints,              
              and the further study of empirical orthogonal functions and their              
              use in studying ozone transport.
