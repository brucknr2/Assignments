Abstract    :
                   A special superconducting magnet with customized                          
              superconducting stabilizing coil which produces a factor fo 50                 
              reduction in effects of external field perturbations, housed in a              
              customized liquid helium cryostat designed to reduce temperature-              
              dependent effects by two orders of magnitude, will be pruchased                
              and applied to mass ratio measurements of unprecedented accuracy.              
              Such measurements will include the proton's atomic mass, the                   
              tritium-helium 3 mass difference, the 15N-14N mass difference, and             
              electronic binding energies in multiply-charged high-Z ions.                   
              Accurate results for these measurements would provide severe                   
              tests of various atomic and nuclear structure theories and                     
              models.
