Abstract    :
              Chua         Nonlinearity is an essential component in almost all natural  (from
              ocean waves to heart rhythms) and man made (from clocks to  lasers) systems,
              but it is often shunned by engineers in view of  its intractability. The goal
              of this research is to exploit the  use of nonlinearity in engineering, and to
              develop mathematical  techniques and numerical tools for analyzing complicated 
              nonlinear phenomena, including bifurcation and failure  boundaries, chaos, and
              the dynamics of sigma-delta modulation.  Among several application areas
              involving nonlinearity, the focus  is on the design of cellular neural networks
              for image processing  such as handwritten character recognition (e.g., ZIP
              codes),  motion detection, and early vision capabilities (e.g., robotic 
              vision). To enhance the future engineer's ability to derive and  validate
              nonlinear device models, and to analyze and design  practical nonlinear
              circuits and systems, user friendly software  and hardware tool kits are being
              developed which implement the  most advanced mathematical theories and
              recently-developed  techniques from nonlinear dynamics.
