Abstract    :
                   Using a newly developed plasma diagnostic, Planar Laser                   
              Induced Fluorescence (PLIF), planer ion densities and velocity                 
              distributions will be measured.                                                
                   Studies will also be made on ion motion in large amplitude                
              drift waves which were found previously to develop chaotic                     
              motion.  A two laser scheme (optical tagging) will be used to                  
              follow the trajectories of ions in two dimensional space.                      
              Modeling studies will be conducted concurrently in order to                    
              explain the experimental results.
