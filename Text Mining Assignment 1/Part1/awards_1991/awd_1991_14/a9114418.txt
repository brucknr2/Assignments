Abstract    :
              This award supports visits over a three year                                   
              period by the various investigators and a                                      
              graduate student, including Drs. Alexander                                     
              Brown, Jeffrey L. Linsky, Stephen A. Drake,                                    
              and Jay A. Bookbinder of the University of                                     
              Colorado Boulder to the Australia Telescope                                    
              National Facility (ATNF) of the CSIRO Division                                 
              of Radiophysics in Marsfield, NSW, Australia,                                  
              to work with Dr. Ronald T. Stewart.  The                                       
              investigators will study stellar radio                                         
              emission with an array of radio telescopes                                     
              called the Australia Telescope (AT).  They                                     
              will exploit the potential of the AT through                                   
              a collaboration combining their experience of                                  
              observing radio stars using the Very Large                                     
              Array (VLA) with the capabilities of this new                                  
              instrument.  The Americans will make two                                       
              collaborative research visits each year during                                 
              a three year period to study the coronae and                                   
              winds of a broad range of stars located in                                     
              almost all parts of the H-R diagram and                                        
              ranging in age from pre-main sequence stars to                                 
              the late stages of stellar evolution.  These                                   
              investigations of both thermal and nonthermal                                  
              radio emission processes in stellar                                            
              atmospheres are logical extensions of their                                    
              current research.
