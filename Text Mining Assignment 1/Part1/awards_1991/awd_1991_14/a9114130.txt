Abstract    :
              The proposed research is to develop a methodology for studying                 
              continuity and change in northwestern Alaskan Inupiat culture in               
              response to fluctuations in environment. The study will focus on               
              a comparative analysis of ethnographic and archaeological patterns             
              of subsistence and land-use practices in the Kotzebue Sound region.            
              Climatic analysis will be based in large part on tree-ring studies             
              in the region. The long-range goal is to identify and interpret the            
              archaeological past when conditions were very different from the               
              present. This approach provides insight into the variability of                
              subsistence practices and human adaptation in the Arctic.
