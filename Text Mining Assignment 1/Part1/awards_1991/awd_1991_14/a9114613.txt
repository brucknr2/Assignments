Abstract    :
              This research, to be conducted in the Department of Chemistry                  
              at the University of California, San Diego, will utilize                       
              time-resolved laser spectroscopy to probe for evidence of                      
              solvent cage effects on Lewis acid base reactions.  The                        
              acid-base pair will be generated by photolytic dissociation of                 
              a ligand from a six-coordinate, iron-porphyrin complex.                        
              Changes in temperature and/or pressure will be used to extend                  
              the temporal range of the spectroscopic experiments, which will                
              be helpful in determining what portion of the reaction occurs                  
              in the solvent cage and what occurs after diffusion of the                     
              reagents out of the solvent cage.

              Professor Douglas Magde of the Department of Chemistry at the                  
              University of California, San Diego will conduct experiments on                
              pairs of reactant molecules generated in close proximity in                    
              solution.  Subsequent reactions of these molecules will be                     
              monitored using rapid spectroscopic methods to determine                       
              whether the surrounding solvent molecules provide a cage effect                
              that serves to hold the reactants together, or whether the                     
              molecules are totally free to move apart and react later in a                  
              subsequent encounter.  These studies are designed to provide                   
              fundamental information important for all reactions that occur                 
              in solution.  The reactants chosen for study are related to                    
              biological oxygen carriers so that the results will have                       
              special applicability to biological functions.
