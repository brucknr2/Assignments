              1992                                                                           
                                                                                             
              This award will support the participation of seven U.S.                        
              scientists in a U.S.-Australia joint seminar on plant carbon and               
              water relations emerging from stable isotope analyses.                         
              Participants will discuss and exchange recent experimental                     
              results on such topical areas as isotope effects in plant                      
              processes, environmental effects on carbon isotope discrimination              
              and water-use efficiency, genotypic differences in water-use                   
              efficiency and interpreting plant hydrogen and oxygen isotopic                 
              composition.  Seminar co-organizers are Dr. James Ehleringer of                
              the University of Utah and Dr. Graham Farquhar of the Australian               
              National University in Canberra.  The seminar will take place                  
              during the first half of 1992 in Riverside, California.  Local                 
              arrangements are being coordinated by staff of the University of               
              California, Riverside, and is held under the auspices of the                   
              U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program.                                    
                                                                                             
              The applications of stable isotope technologies to the plant                   
              sciences in recent years have had a significant impact on                      
              increasing the understanding of plant gas exchange, water                      
              relations, and photosynthesis from genetics levels through                     
              ecosystem levels, and across such fields of study and application              
              as agriculture, forestry and ecology.  Much of this research has               
              been driven by U.S. and Australian scientists.  This seminar will              
              provide an opportunity for the exchange of information and ideas               
              on the topic subject, and will promote possible future joint                   
              research projects.
