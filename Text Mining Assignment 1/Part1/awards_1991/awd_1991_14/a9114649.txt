Abstract    :
              Since in most applications of control theory there is                          
              only limited, imprecise information of the physical                            
              phenomena to formulate the mathematical models, the                            
              control of an unknown system is probably the most                              
              basic problem in control theory.  Often in these                               
              descriptions there are perturbations, unmodelled                               
              dynamics or inaccuracies that can be effectively                               
              modelled as noise so there is the problem of stochastic                        
              adaptive control.  It is proposed to have a workshop on                        
              stochastic theory and adaptive control.  The assembling                        
              of leading researchers on stochastic control and                               
              filtering and stochastic adaptive control is planned.                          
              The communication among these people will expose                               
              various methods in adaptive control and techniques                             
              from stochastic analysis that should be important in the                       
              solution of basic problems in adaptive control.  In                            
              addition, the PI's intend to invite a number of graduate                       
              students to provide them with additional exposure to                           
              this area of research.
