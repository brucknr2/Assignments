Abstract    :
                   The objective of this endeavor is to develop a methodology for            
              the design of three dimensional shapes subject to general geometric            
              and mechanical behavior requirements.  Starting from an initial                
              shape, a geometric reasoning kernel is used to generate and control            
              a sequence of numerical optimization subproblems that converges to             
              a final design (a topology and associated geometry) that can be                
              significantly different from the starting shape.  The geometric                
              representation of the shape is adaptive and changes throughout the             
              problem solving process to accommodate the shape change trends that            
              occur.                                                                         
                   The combination of geometric reasoning and numerical                      
              optimization techniques is expected to provide a robust and                    
              systematic methodology for shape synthesis that can generate new               
              design shapes without relying on heuristic or domain specific                  
              knowledge.
