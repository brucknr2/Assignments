Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Most zooplankton undergo diel vertical migration (DVM) at                 
              some stage of development.  The common pattern involves an                     
              ascent near sunset and descent near sunrise.  The most                         
              pervasive functional explanations are the animals rise to feed                 
              at night and descend to avoid visually-oriented predators                      
              during the day.  Recent studies indicate the presence and                      
              absence of planktivores can alter DVM through rapid behavioral                 
              changes.  Since light is the most important cue for DVM,                       
              alterations in migration by cues from predators should involve                 
              changes in photoresponses.  The research objectives in Dr.                     
              Forward's investigation are (1) to determine whether                           
              photoresponses involved in DVM are altered by the presence or                  
              absence of visually- and nonvisually-directed predators, and                   
              (2) to determine whether chemical, visual and/or mechanical                    
              cues from predators induce alterations in zooplankton                          
              photoresponses.  These studies will make a significant                         
              contribution to our basic understanding of zooplankton sensory                 
              biology and interactions with predators.
