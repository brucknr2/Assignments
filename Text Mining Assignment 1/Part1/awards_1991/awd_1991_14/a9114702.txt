Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     The RIDGE Initiative provide support for theoretical                   
              integration of field and laboratory studies of ridge.crest                     
              processes. To provide a strong natural focus to attract highly                 
              capable thoreticians from within the broader geological                        
              /biolobical community, a second annual RIDGE Theoretical                       
              Insttitute will be conveined. The purpose of the Institute is to               
              provide an environment for progress on critical theoretical RIDGE              
              problems that require an interdisciplinary approach with two                   
              specific goals: to give researchers and their students the                     
              required background to address complex interdisciplinary                       
              problems, and to foster stron linkages among theoretical                       
              developments on a particular ridge.crest problem. This Institute               
              will focus on magmatic on magmatic and hydrothermal systems, and               
              will consist of a short course of lectures, discussions, and                   
              poster sessions, to be followed by a workshop that will provide a              
              forum for intensive scientific interaction among participants.
