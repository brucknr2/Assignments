Abstract    :
              In this research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                      
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, electroactive                     
              organized thiol monolayers will be fabricated on gold                          
              electrodes.  The layers will be studied both spectroscopically,                
              by wetting contact angle goniometry, and electrochemically.                    
              The dependence of electrochemical kinetics on thin film                        
              structure and environment will be determined.  One goal is the                 
              elucidation of the applicability of Marcus rate theory and                     
              electron tunneling theory to thin film environments.                           
              Characterization of the permeability of the films will provide                 
              information on porosity of the film, which might otherwise                     
              compromise the quality of the data.                                            
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              Electron transfer reactions at surfaces occur in such diverse                  
              situations as neurotransmission, photosynthesis, electrolysis                  
              to form many bulk materials (aluminum, chlorine), and sensor                   
              transduction (species-selective electrodes).  This research                    
              seeks to understand the dynamics of electron transfers in                      
              membranes adjacent to metal surfaces.  In general, coating an                  
              electrode with a membrane modifies the rate of electrochemical                 
              reaction.  In this project, the distance dependence of electron                
              transfer rates and the changes in membrane chemistry due to the                
              transfers are of primary interest.
