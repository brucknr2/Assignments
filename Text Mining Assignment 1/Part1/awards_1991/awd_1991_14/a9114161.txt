Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic                      
              environment and its role in global change which is promoted                    
              by NSF's Arctic System Science Program.  It is a two year                      
              project to explore the roles of turbulent mixing processes                     
              in the Arctic Ocean.  These considerations have previously                     
              been neglected in traditional mixed layer modeling applied                     
              to the arctic system for ocean-atmosphere-ice interactions.                    
              A hierarchy of models will be developed and applied to                         
              ascertain the importance of various processes that are                         
              specifically influential to the circulation of the Arctic                      
              Ocean.
