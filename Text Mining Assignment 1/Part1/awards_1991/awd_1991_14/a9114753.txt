Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will follow the rapidly changing                                   
              conditions produced by the fifth year of                                       
              drought in California and will collect data                                    
              which otherwise would be lost.  The study                                      
              will focus on the following four areas:  a)                                    
              the acquisition and analysis of drought-                                       
              related meteorological and hydrological data                                   
              in order to assess the uniqueness of this                                      
              drought episode; b) the assessment of the                                      
              drought monitoring procedures in order to                                      
              determine how efficiently the drought's                                        
              beginning was detected and the drought's                                       
              progression was evaluated; c) the assessment                                   
              of the effect of the drought on the                                            
              performance of major water resource                                            
              engineering projects; and d) the assessment                                    
              of the performance of unusual response                                         
              measures, e.g., water transfers and water                                      
              banking.  The results of this work will                                        
              benefit climatologists, hydrologists,                                          
              planners and managers, and researchers from                                    
              government, the private sector and academia.
