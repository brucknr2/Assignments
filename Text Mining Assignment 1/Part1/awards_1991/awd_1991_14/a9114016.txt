Abstract    :
                   A User Services Area Council (USAC) has been established to               
              promote and encourage creative exchange of international user                  
              service needs and concepts.  Constructive input from various                   
              national and international user services organizations' efforts is             
              also encouraged.  USAC will be responsible for researching and                 
              defining short term and long term user services needs and                      
              coordinating developments in finding solutions.                                
                   The proposed effort is to chair and direct the USAC to promote            
              cooperation and collaboration on user services issues of the                   
              Internet on an international and global scale.  Funding will be                
              provided for the attendance at three meetings during the next 12               
              months: the RARE meeting in Brussels, the RIPE meeting in Geneva,              
              and the COSINE meeting in Paris.                                               
                   Thus USAC intends to provide a forum of global internet                   
              collaboration by encouraging and coordinating international                    
              interaction between existing global user services groups.  It will             
              also provide guidance to countries that are just beginning to                  
              develop and provide their user services communities with support.
