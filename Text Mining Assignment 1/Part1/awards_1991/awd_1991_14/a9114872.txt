Abstract    :
              The main objective of this research is to develop                              
              new decomposition schemes for decentralized                                    
              control and computations of complex systems.  The                              
              schemes serve to identify weakly coupled groups of                             
              variables (subsystems) that can be considered                                  
              independently as subproblems and their solutions                               
              combined in some way to come up with the solution                              
              of the overall problem.  Epsilon decompositions will                           
              be applied to large plants composed of overlapping                             
              subsystems.  The main motivation is that the                                   
              decompositions can help in formulating                                         
              decentralized control laws with overlapping                                    
              information sets, which are superior to disjoint                               
              control laws, especially when control of complex                               
              power systems is considered.
