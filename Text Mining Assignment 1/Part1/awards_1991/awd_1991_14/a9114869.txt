Abstract    :
              The objective of this research program is to investigate the                   
              effects of nonlinear soil behavior on the response of soil-                    
              structure systems to earthquake loading.                                       
                                                                                             
              The project involves:  (a) the development of a numerical model                
              to represent the various phenomena to be studied, such as the                  
              mechanical response of the soil and nonreflecting boundary                     
              conditions; (b) validation of the model by first comparing the                 
              predictions of the linear component of the model against closed-               
              form analytical solutions for simplified systems, then by                      
              introducing nonlinearities into these simplified systems; and (c)              
              following calibration of                                                       
               the numerical model, use of this                                              
              model to analyze and interpret the                                             
              data for a scaled-down nuclear

              Taiwan, where soil nonlinearities                                              
              and soil-structure interaction                                                 
              effects are dominant.  This
