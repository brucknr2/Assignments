Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation                
              to study the properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, and sea-              
              ice on a transect between Murmansk, USSR and Nome, Alaska.  It                 
              will assess the quantity and character of sediments contained in               
              the ice canopy of the Arctic Basin.  This investigation will                   
              evaluate the effects of sediment on the reflectivity, thermal                  
              balance, transmissivity, and sub-ice biology.  The presence and                
              nature of sediments on sea ice may also shed light on the                      
              dynamics of ice movement and the relationships between sea-ice                 
              cover and sediment accumulations on the ocean floor.
