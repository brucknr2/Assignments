Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The dynamic responses of unique molecular materials will be                    
              investigated using femtosecond optical and infrared methods to                 
              reveal the nature of ultrafast processes occuring in materials that            
              include molecular crystals, polymer glasses and crystals, and metal            
              complexes.
