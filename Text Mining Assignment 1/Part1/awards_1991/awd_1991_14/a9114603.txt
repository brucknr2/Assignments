Abstract    :
                   Professor Rohrlich will work on several problems connected                
              with the realization of Galois representations of Mordell-Weil                 
              groups of elliptic curves.  In particular, whether certain                     
              irreducible Artin representations occur and if so what are their               
              multiplicities.                                                                
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
