Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the feasibility of using high                    
              frequency ultra-sound techniques to determine flaws, rebars, and               
              strength of concrete.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The results and techniques will be useful to determine the                     
              condition of existing concrete structures.
