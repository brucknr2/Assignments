Abstract    :
              This proposal is for support of the Eight Optical                              
              Fiber Sensors Conference, Monterey, CA, January                                
              29-31, 1992.  This conference serves as the principal                          
              international forum for reporting advances in the                              
              development and applications of optical fiber                                  
              sensors, guided wave optical sensors, and the                                  
              underlying fundamental technologies and                                        
              components.  Optical fiber sensors have important                              
              applications to many commercial technology areas,                              
              such as in industrial control, building structures,                            
              avionics and medicine.  The increasing diversity of                            
              applications of this sensor technology is the main                             
              impetus for this request of conference support from                            
              the IEEE.  Funds are sought to provide partial                                 
              support for travel and conference expenses of                                  
              graduate students and faculty who may be relatively                            
              new to the field.
