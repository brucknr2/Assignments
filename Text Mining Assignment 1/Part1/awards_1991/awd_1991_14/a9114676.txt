Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A detailed formulation of vehicle traffic behavior will be                     
              developed as flow on a Markovian network.  Algorithms to track the             
              model's parameters using real time data, and real-time control                 
              methods will also be developed and validated.                                  
                                                                                             
              The results will be a model which considers traffic signal                     
              operations and drive information strategies in a unified manner,               
              thus, permitting real-time integrated management of traffic                    
              systems.
