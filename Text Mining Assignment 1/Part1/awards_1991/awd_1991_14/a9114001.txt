Abstract    :
                   This award is in the joint Engineering/Computer Information               
              Science Engineering ENG/CISE Research Thrust in Intelligent                    
              Material Handling Systems.  The objective is to develop an enabling            
              environment for intelligent material handling systems.  This                   
              environment will integrate, analysis and synthesis techniques from             
              Operations Research, Artificial Intelligence, Controls Engineering,            
              Geometry, Robotics and Vision and Parallel Computing into a                    
              seamless, extendable system for design and control of material                 
              handling systems.                                                              
                   The development of such an environment requires that a number             
              of fundamental problems in each of the areas mentioned above be                
              solved or adapted to make them useful in material handling.                    
              Further, integration of results from these areas into a single                 
              system raises a number of questions involving communications,                  
              resources allocation and interfacing protocol etc.  A                          
              proof-of-concept system demonstrating the concept of an intelligent            
              material  handling enabling environment (IMHEE) will be developed.             
              This system will be configured to control material handling systems            
              in two different domains:  factory floors and building construction            
              sites.
