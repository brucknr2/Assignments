Abstract    :
                   Research will be carried out in high energy electron                      
              scattering at SLAC.  The principal focus will be on                            
              experiments which probe the quark substructure of nucleons and                 
              few nucleon systems.  Part of the research activities will be                  
              to coordinate the Nuclear Physics at the SLAC program and                      
              facilitate experiments in SLAC End Station A.
