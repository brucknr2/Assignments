Abstract    :
                   The Global Weather Experiment (GWE) of early 1979 deployed                
              augmented observational systems that offered, for the first time,              
              truly global coverage at least on the largest (planetary wave)                 
              scales of the atmospheric circulation.  Analysis techniques were               
              subsequently developed that merged these observations with the                 
              output of continually running numerical models to obtain data sets             
              consistent with the physical and dynamical laws built into the                 
              models.  Research with these data sets has provided new insights on            
              planetary-scale circulation features which vary slowly over intra-             
              seasonal to seasonal periods.  Dr. Nogues-Paegle will use a 10-year            
              data set, which was prepared with state-of-the-art techniques for              
              assimilating observations into numerical model solutions, to look              
              at the vertical structure of such circulation features.  The                   
              vertical structure detected will provide an indication as to the               
              relative roles of local and remote energy sources in the excitation            
              and maintenance of the quasi-stationary waves composing these                  
              features.  The results should guide the development of general                 
              circulation models so they simulate seasonal and intraseasonal                 
              changes more accurately.  Such improved predictions will have                  
              enhanced credibility and utility in the framing of environmental               
              policy and economic resource allocation decisions.
