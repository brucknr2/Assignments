Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Using a dedicated high-dispersion fiber-fed spectrograph                  
              facility at the 1.1-m telescope of Lowell Observatory, we propose              
              to study stellar/solar magnetic cycles and chromospheric activity              
              The spectrograph records, using CCD detectors, the line profiles               
              of Ca II at the K line (3933 ) and the infrared triplet (8542                 
              ), and H. (6563 ) for solar-type stars and for the Sun itself,               
              observed as just another star using the same instrument.  The                  
              purpose of these observations is to use stellar cycles as tools                
              to study the solar cycle.  From detailed studies of cycle                      
              morphology (amplitude, shape, regularity) as a function of                     
              stellar mass, age, rotation rate, chemical composition, etc., we               
              may hope to:                                                                   
                                                                                             
                   (a) Infer the time-history of cyclic behavior for a star                  
              like the Sun over its entire lifetime, including information                   
              about the statistical frequency of major departures from "normal"              
              behavior (e.g., Maunder minima); and                                           
                                                                                             
                   (b) Obtain a broad perspective of the total ensemble of                   
              cycles possible, hence gain deep insight into the nature of                    
              stellar dynamos and into the ultimate origins of stellar                       
              magnetism.                                                                     
                                                                                             
                   Stellar cycles provide complementary information                          
              unobtainable from observations of the Sun itself but of crucial                
              importance to understanding the solar cycle.
