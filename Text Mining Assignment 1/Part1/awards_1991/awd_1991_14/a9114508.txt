Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Model development and theoretical studies of viscoelastic flow                 
              instabilities are to be carried out. Domain decomposition and                  
              pseudospectral numerical codes will be used to explore the                     
              stability of flow configurations representative of polymer                     
              processing systems. The main focus will be on the coupling of                  
              such models to one simulating the near-wall region for                         
              polymers flowing past solid surfaces, based on simulated                       
              microstructures, to explore the effect of wall slip on flow                    
              instabilities.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The work is expected to lead to more robust and realistic                      
              numerical modeling of complex polymer processes. The modeling                  
              also relates to drag reduction from fluids with polymer                        
              additives.
