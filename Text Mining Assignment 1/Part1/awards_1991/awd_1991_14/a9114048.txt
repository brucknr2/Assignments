Abstract    :
              The objective of the research is to develop an adequate                        
              constitutive model and a suitable formulation which can be applied             
              to the nonlinear structural analysis of simulating progressive                 
              damage growth commonly exhibited in heterogeneous materials.  The              
              concept of nonlocal continuum with local strain will be                        
              incorporated into the slanted-ellipse model.  The localization                 
              instability and proper convergence in displacements, stresses, and             
              energy will be verified by analyzing various typical members.  The             
              numerical efficiency and the effects of different numerical                    
              algorithms will be examined.  The attempt of using boundary element            
              method in the damage prediction of large-scale structures will also            
              be studied.
