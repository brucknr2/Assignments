Abstract    :
                   This grant is for support of students student travel to a                 
              Chapman Conference on Auroral Plasma Dynamics to be held in                    
              Minneapolis, Minnesota on October 21-25, 1991.  Chapman                        
              Conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the American                     
              Geophysical Union and are designed to promote opportunities for                
              interaction not normally available in large meetings.  This                    
              conference examine the state of the art of auroral plasma physics              
              in light of recent sounding rocket and satellite observations of               
              the auroral zone.  ***
