Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support collaborative research between James                   
              Serrin, University of Minnesota, and Patrizia Pucci, University                
              of Modena, Italy.  The proposed program deals with existence,                  
              uniqueness, symmetry, asymptotic and boundary behavior of                      
              solutions of linear and quasilinear second order equations or                  
              systems of equations of elliptic and parabolic type, and with                  
              problems in fluid dynamics.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Specific problems to be investigated include the existence and                 
              uniqueness of ground state solutions for general equations of                  
              variational or non-variational type; behavior of solutions of                  
              quasilinear equations or systems of equations of elliptic and                  
              parabolic type; properties of fundamental solutions, Harnack                   
              inequalities and boundary behavior of solutions of linear                      
              elliptic-parabolic equations; symmetry properties of solutions of              
              linear and quasilinear second order equations; and structure of one-           
              dimensional solutions of compressible Navier-Stokes equations.                 
              The proposed collaboration will make an important contribution to              
              nonlinear analysis.
