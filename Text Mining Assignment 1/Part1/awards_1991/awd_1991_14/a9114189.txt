Abstract    :
              Professor Sidney Benson is supported by a grant from the                       
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              thermochemical and kinetic studies of important radical                        
              reactions.  Professor Benson will continue his studies of                      
              reaction kinetics using the Very Low Pressure Reactor (VLPR)                   
              which he has developed.  Two specific areas of research will be                
              pursued: 1) kinetics of reactions of alkyl radicals with oxygen                
              in an effort to distinguish the addition mechanism from the                    
              methathesis mechanism, and to identify both if they are                        
              competitive; and 2) kinetics of atom-radical reactions between                 
              chlorine and hydrogen atoms and species such as alkanes,                       
              alkenes and chloro- and fluoro- alkanes and alkenes.                           
              %%%                                                                            
              A more complete understanding of gas phase chemical reactions                  
              is essential in order to improve the efficiency of hydrocarbon                 
              combustion, and to mediate the environmental impact of various                 
              combustion byproducts in the atmosphere.  Professor Benson's                   
              research has led to an understanding of the phenomenon of hot                  
              ignition, and the factors which contribute to engine knocking.                 
              Using a specialized instrument known as a Very Low Pressure                    
              Reactor, Professor Benson is able to study the underlying free                 
              radical mechanisms for these processes in a controlled                         
              laboratory environment.
