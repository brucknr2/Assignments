Abstract    :
                   This is research to test the basic assumptions underlying many            
              of the existing models of manufacturing systems.  Modern                       
              manufacturing systems now may have combinations of robots, complex             
              numerically controlled machines, automated guided vehicles, and                
              automated storage and retrieval systems as part of an array of                 
              equipment in use in the system.  Each of these innovations serve               
              to lower the inherent variance associated with the operation of the            
              system.  In addition, computer networks maintain system state                  
              information, opening the door for more sophisticated control of the            
              manufacturing system.                                                          
                   This project takes a serious look at the appropriateness of               
              the assumptions underlying models of the modern manufacturing                  
              system.
