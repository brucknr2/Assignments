Abstract    :
              The stabilization of cloned genes in microorganisms is                         
              extremely important for productive recombinant cell                            
              processes.  The goals of this proposal include determining                     
              the extent and enhancement of amplification possible, the                      
              time-scale and frequency on which it occurs, development                       
              and study of a model system for intracellular protein                          
              production, determining the effects on the host strain,                        
              stability studies, and population modeling.  Yeast                             
              retrotransposons offer a unique approach for obtaining                         
              large numbers of integrated cloned genes.  The results                         
              from the research should demonstrate the potential of this                     
              unique system for the stable integrations of multiple                          
              cloned genes, a method, which in many instances, should be                     
              superior to the more commonly utilized plasmid systems.
