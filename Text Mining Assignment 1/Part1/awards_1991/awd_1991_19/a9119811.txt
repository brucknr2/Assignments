Abstract    :
              We propose to continue for three more years the research program               
              currently supported by NSF Grant ATM-8721669.  Most of the work                
              will fall into one of three areas: (1) incoherent scatter                      
              research, particularly at high altitudes, (2) auroral radar                    
              studies, and (3) studies of temperate latitude E-region plasma                 
              instabilities similar to those seen at the equator, and perhaps                
              also temperate latitude spread F.  Some effort may also be                     
              devoted to PMSE (polar mesospheric summer echoes) research.  In                
              most of these areas an active research program is already                      
              underway; in some cases the program has existed for a number of                
              years and has produced a substantial scientific return.
