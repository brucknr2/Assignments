Abstract    :
                   Knowledge of the high pressure and high temperature behavior              
              of key physical properties of minerals is an essential ingredient              
              in the continuing effort to understand convection within Earth's               
              mantle.  Since much of our current understanding is still based on             
              assumed and extrapolated elastic and thermal properties of silicate            
              minerals, it remains difficult to determine whether or not radial              
              seismic models for the mantle imply chemical stratification.  The              
              PI has constructed a laboratory for the measurement at high                    
              pressure and temperature of key physical properties of candidate               
              mantle constituents.  Laser-Induced Phonon Spectroscopy has been               
              coupled with diamond anvil cell technology to measure elastic                  
              constants and thermal diffusivity of minerals at high pressure.                
              Results for olivine to 7 GPa have recently been reported.                      
              Extension of such measurements on a variety of minerals to a                   
              transition zone and lower mantle pressure regime (12 to 25 GPA) is             
              a principle goals of the present work.  Measurements at                        
              simultaneous high temperature and pressure will be attempted.
