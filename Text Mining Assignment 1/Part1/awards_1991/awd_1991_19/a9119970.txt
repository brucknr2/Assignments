Abstract    :
                   This group of five senior investigators, research                         
              associates and students will continue their research in                        
              elementary particle physics.  They are involved in experiments                 
              at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring to study the properties                   
              of the b-quark, the heaviest quark detected to date and the c-                 
              quark, the next heaviest quark.  The new particle detector and                 
              upgrades to the storage ring, perform as designed.  High                       
              precision data will provide new tests of the standard model of                 
              the elementary particles.
