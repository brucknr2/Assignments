Abstract    :
              This is a joint seminar proposed by Dr. Ward Winer, Georgia                    
              Institute of Technology, and Professor Shui-Shong Lu, National                 
              Taiwan University supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan)                 
              Cooperative Science Program.  This seminar will discuss recent                 
              research results on advanced manufacturing processes in the U.S.               
              and Taiwan.  Advanced manufacturing processes is an important                  
              topic for both the U.S. and Taiwan.  The researchers proposed for              
              participation in this meeting are the leading scientists in this               
              field.  A workshop on this topic can benefit the scientists and                
              the manufacturing industry in the U.S. and Taiwan.  The Materials              
              Processing and Manufacturing Program contributed $5,000 in joint               
              funding for this workshop.
