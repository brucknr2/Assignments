Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research is to be continued on phase change phenomena under                    
              strongly non-equilibrium conditions in tetrograde fluids.                      
              These are characterized by a combination of high molecular                     
              weight and heat capacity.  Shock wave and expansion wave                       
              phenomena can then, under certain conditions, be reverse from                  
              what is accepted as normal.  The investigation is mainly                       
              experimental, complemented with theoretical modeling.  It is                   
              focused on liquefaction shock thickness, and futher details of                 
              expansion shocks and spinoidal phase changes.  The test fluid                  
              will be iso-octane.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This research has applications to future fuel injection                        
              systems for producing more complete fuel vaporization in the                   
              combustion chamber.
