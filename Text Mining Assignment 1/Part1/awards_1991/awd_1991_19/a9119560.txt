Abstract    :
                   Hymenoclea salsola is a warm-desert shrub with a large                    
              geographic range in North American deserts.  When plants                       
              originating from diverse geographic locations were grown in a                  
              common garden, genetic differentiation was observed in plant                   
              characters influencing the rate and photosynthetic efficiency of               
              water consumption.  It is hypothesized that environmentally-                   
              imposed variation in water-loss rates alters the balance between               
              water acquisition and consumption, and accounts for the genetic                
              differentiation of different geographic races.  To investigate                 
              the underlying mechanisms, separate measures of root, stem and                 
              whole plant hydraulic conductance (water transport capacity                    
              between soil and leaf) will be make using several techniques                   
              applying known pressure differentials over the respective                      
              pathways and determining consequent flux rates.  These data will               
              be integrated with measures of whole canopy gas-exchange (water-               
              loss and photosynthesis), and carbon isotope discrimination                    
              during photosynthesis.  The plasticity of individual genotypes to              
              short-term changes in growth conditions will be compared with                  
              genetic differentiation to contrasting conditions over                         
              evolutionary time.  The importance of hydraulic limitations will               
              be evaluated in terms of immediate feed-back control on stomatal               
              behavior, and also long-term adaptive differentiation across                   
              geographic races.  The results will enhance our understanding of               
              1) the integration of resource capture and consumption in plant                
              water relations, 2) limitations imposed by plant morphology on                 
              physiological activity, 3) mechanistic relationships between                   
              plant water-use characteristics and climatic variation, and 4)                 
              the relationship of a unique arid-land plant habit, a canopy of                
              photosynthetic stems, to general principles of plant water-                    
              relations.
