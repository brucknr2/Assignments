Abstract    :
              A continuation and expansion of the successful research                        
              carried on by the principal investigators is proposed.  In                     
              particular, we propose to model some classes of connectionist                  
              networks within the paradigm of inductive inference.  This                     
              will enable a precise characterization of the ultimate                         
              learning potential of connectionist networks, compared to                      
              other techniques for machine learning, i.e. learning by                        
              example and its derivatives.  This award includes additional                   
              support to supply infrastructure for the Latvian                               
              collaborators, in the form of workstations.
