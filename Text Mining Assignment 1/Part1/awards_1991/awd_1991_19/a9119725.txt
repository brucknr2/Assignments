Abstract    :
              This two-year project will lead to a regional database for the                 
              salt marsh ecosystem bordering Georgia and South Carolina.  The                
              project will be built upon existing geographic information system              
              databases at the University of Georgia Marine Institute, the                   
              Center for Remote Sensing and Mapping Science in Athens, GA and                
              the University of South Carolina Belle W. Baruch Institute for                 
              Marine Biology and Coastal Research.  Groups at Savannah State                 
              College and the Baruch Institute at North Inlet, SC, will also be              
              involved.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The goals of this project will be threefold.  1)  Construction of              
              a multi-level nested database tied to the North American Datum of              
              1983, with standardized classes of information for coastal land                
              use/land cover, hydrology, and vegetation at regional and site-                
              specific scales.  2)  Development of data integration and                      
              analysis techniques that are appropriate for the construction and              
              use of multi-level nested databases of coastal areas.  3)                      
              Determination of the optimum scales and resolutions of data                    
              needed to address questions for regional and site-specific                     
              studies, including assessments of the gain or loss of information              
              as a result of moving between regional and site-specific layers                
              of the database.
