Abstract    :
                   Dr. Jon Gelhaus of the Academy of Natural Sciences in                     
              Philadelphia is studying the biological diversity and taxonomic                
              relationships of crane flies inhabiting desert regions of the                  
              North American Southwest.  Although crane flies are typically                  
              most diverse and abundant in moist habitats, several subgroups                 
              show repeated, independent evolution and diversification into                  
              arid habitats, a phenomenon apparently unique to the American                  
              Southwest in this otherwise worldwide group of insects.                        
                   Three main objectives are being pursued: (1) Define the                   
              species subgroups within the crane fly subgenus Lunatipula of                  
              genus Tipula in the northern hemisphere, from which nearly all of              
              the desert crane fly species groups have arisen; (2) Examine in                
              detail three desert crane fly groups of Lunatipula, describing                 
              and illustrating all new and previously known species,                         
              determining the geographical distribution of each species and                  
              inferring each group's phylogenetic history; and (3) Use                       
              knowledge of the geographic ranges and evolutionary history of                 
              these three crane fly groups, as well as those previously                      
              published for other North American desert insects, to synthesize               
              a general hypothesis regarding development and diversification of              
              the North American desert insect fauna.  The studies will utilize              
              specimens already in museums as well as those secured on three                 
              collecting trips to the Southwest and northern Mexico.
