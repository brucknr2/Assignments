Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative                      
              research project between Professor John Wingfield, Department of               
              Zoology, University of Washington, and Professor Masaru Wada,                  
              Department of General Education, Tokyo Medical and Dental                      
              University.  Dr. Wingfield studies the role of environmental factors           
              in controlling the breeding cycle in birds.  His present research              
              involves assaying reproductive hormones in different species on                
              birds under different environmental conditions.  His project with              
              Professor Wada involves collaboration to develop and apply cDNA                
              probes for the reproductive hormones in chicken, since these                   
              probes will hybridize with the pituitary DNA of these birds.                   
                                                                                             
              Avian reproductive cycles are diverse, spanning continuums from                
              brief to essentially continuous breeding seasons, and from precisely           
              timed to opportunistic reproductive periods.  This collaborative               
              effort will measure changes in gene expression for reproductive                
              hormones in response to environmental signals.  This will extend               
              Dr. Wingfield's current research to test a constancy/contingency               
              model of predictability as a potential unifying hypothesis to explain          
              how birds, and perhaps other organisms, integrate environmental                
              maturation under varying environmental conditions.
