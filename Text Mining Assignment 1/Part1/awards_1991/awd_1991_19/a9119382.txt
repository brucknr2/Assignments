Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for the operation, and analysis of data            
              from, an all-sky camera (ASC) at South Pole.  The pictures from the            
              ASC are important for many auroral investigations, both to provide             
              auroral morphology and to estimate sky cloud cover.  Even though               
              the 35 mm film is analogue in nature, and therefore somewhat                   
              qualitative, more quantitative information will be provided by                 
              digitizing some of the film on sophisticated optical devices at                
              other laboratories.  The same grant provides support for the                   
              operation of an ionosonde.                                                     
                                                                                             
              These instruments are important for determining the ionospheric                
              "weather", and should be operated on a continuing basis just as the            
              tropospheric weather is recorded on a regular basis by the station             
              Meteorology Department.
