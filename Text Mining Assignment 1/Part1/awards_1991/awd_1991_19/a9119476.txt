Abstract    :
              Fungi that grow on leaf surfaces alternate between a life cycle                
              phase on the leaf, a transport phase in the atmosphere, and                    
              growth                                                                         
              on another leaf of the same host or host of species, on a                      
              different                                                                      
              host species, or on some other substrate.  Essentially nothing is              
                                                                                             
              known quantitatively about the demography of these fungi in situ.              
                                                                                             
              The ultimate goal of this research is to produce a model for the

              surfaces.                                                                      
              To provide the foundation for the demographic study, the further               
                                                                                             
              development of molecular methods to track all epiphytic members                
              of                                                                             
              the A. pullulans population in situ is proposed.  Second, to                   
              discriminate introduced from background populations, the (GUS)                 
              gene                                                                           
              from E. coli will be installed into A. pullulans thereby allowing              
                                                                                             
              the detection of fungus chromogenically or fluorogenically in                  
              situ.                                                                          
              Live versus dead cells will be confirmed independently by a vital              
                                                                                             
              staining method.  The system will be evaluated and modelled under              
                                                                                             
              controlled and uncontrolled systems and then used to test the                  
              hypothesis that "source" areas (growth>immigration; and                        
              growth>death + emigration) exist for A. pullulans on leaves at                 
              different positions within the tree canopy.  The project has                   
              implications for both basic ecology (community processes and                   
              structure) and for the biological control of plant pathogens.
