Abstract    :
              This effort by the National Society of Professional Engineers, for             
              $22,500 will help underwrite the 1992, 1993 and 1994 National                  
              Engineers Week/Discover "E" programs.  National Engineers Week is              
              a public program conducted by the engineering community in America.            
              Over the last forty years, it has evolved into a popular and highly            
              visible program with a special emphasis on student outreach                    
              activities. The National Engineers Week Committee provides print               
              and audio-visual materials to engineers participating in Discover              
              "E" teach-ins and other public outreach activities.  By such                   
              support for this effort, NSF will join more than 30 companies,                 
              engineering societies and government agencies in underwriting the              
              costs of the program.
