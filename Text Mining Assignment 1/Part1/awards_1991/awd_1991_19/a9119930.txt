Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, to be carried out by one of the leading U.S. experts             
              in neutral hydrogen studies, seeks to answer some of the many                  
              unanswered questions about the formation and evolution of galaxies             
              from primordial clouds of gas into the complex systems of stars and            
              gas we now see.  This investigation will compare the structure and             
              dynamics of nearby galaxies with corresponding high redshift                   
              objects of much younger age.  By studying the processes which                  
              continue to modify the structure of galaxies, and surveying the                
              distribution of neutral hydrogen in a sufficiently large volume of             
              space, strict constraints will be placed on the efficiency of                  
              conversion or primordial gas into gravitationally bound galactic               
              systems.
