Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Theoretical and numerical investigation of ocean physical                      
              processes, particularly wave dynamics in low latitudes, are                    
              continuing.  The major thrust of the project is to study equatorial            
              vortices and turbulence via a numerical time-integration model. The            
              goals are to understand equatorial turbulent funneling of energy               
              towards the equator, vortex condensation, potential vorticity/                 
              streakfunction relationships and stability of large amplitude                  
              solitons.
