Abstract    :
              This project investigates the                                                  
              combustion synthesis and                                                       
              wet-chemical synthesis methods for                                             
              producing ultrafine alloy particles                                            
              in the form of nanosize reinforced                                             
              in situ composites.  Emphasis will                                             
              be given to the production of                                                  
              Ti/TiB2 composites, although the                                               
              processes employed are applicable to                                           
              a wide range of intermetallics.  The                                           
              methodology for combustion synthesis                                           
              involves reacting Na with TiCl4 and                                            
              BCI3 to produce a Ti/TiB2 alloy.  A                                            
              flow reactor will be constructed                                               
              which simulate the processes that                                              
              would occur in a production-scale                                              
              system, but also allow for a                                                   
              detailed investigation of the                                                  
              particle formation, growth and                                                 
              cooling processes.  Measurements                                               
              will be performed by a combination                                             
              of probe sampling and light

              the syntheses, sizes, and
