Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Myelin is a compact, multilammellar structure that insulates the               
              axons of nerve cells and promotes the rapid conduction of nerve                
              impulses.  This project is designed to test the application of                 
              Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microscopy to examine myelin.                
              Due to its simple protein composition, and compact nature, myelin              
              is an ideal substance for analysis by FTIR microscopy.  The                    
              method will enable Dr. LeVine to resolve the infrared spectra of               
              minute amounts of material.  This analysis entails utilizing FTIR              
              microscopy to distinguish the in situ, infrared spectrum of                    
              myelin from normal animals, and myelin from animals with genetic               
              mutations which affect myelin.  In addition, Dr. LeVine will                   
              study the infrared spectrum of myelin during different stages of               
              development.  The infrared spectrum of this substance will reveal              
              chemical differences that exist between the two forms of myelin                
              and prompt the identification of these differences.  If                        
              successful, this technology could be a new frontier in the                     
              neurosciences, opening a new field of exploration.
