Abstract    :
                   Most of the observable traits of plants and animals are                   
              affected by many genetic factors.  The theory for the inheritance              
              of such traits is known as quantitative genetics.  For the past                
              60 years, animal and plant breeders have used quantitative                     
              genetics to improve domestic animals and crop species.  In the                 
              past 20 years, quantitative genetics has swept into evolutionary               
              biology and is revolutionizing our understanding of evolutionary               
              processes and the genealogy of living species (phylogenetics).                 
              In applying quantitative genetic theory on an evolutionary time                
              scale, one needs to assume that the system of inheritance remains              
              unchanged.  To make a strong test for constancy of inheritance,                
              one needs good estimates of the inheritance systems for multiple               
              populations which, in turn, have known evolutionary                            
              relationships.  These requirements are difficult to meet and so                
              strong tests for constancy of inheritance have not yet been                    
              conducted.  The current project is a proposal for such a strong                
              test using natural populations of garter snakes and water snakes.              
              The strength of the proposal rests on the facts that: (1) large                
              numbers of families can be sampled in each population to give                  
              good estimates of inheritance, (2) multiple populations and                    
              species can be sampled and (3) the phylogenetic relationships of               
              the populations and species have already been established using                
              modern molecular techniques.  The rationale of the proposal is                 
              that by using natural populations of snakes that are ideally                   
              suited for comparative studies of inheritance, one can test a key              
              assumption in evolutionary studies and perhaps uncover a                       
              principle of genetic constancy that applies to all species of                  
              plants and animals.
