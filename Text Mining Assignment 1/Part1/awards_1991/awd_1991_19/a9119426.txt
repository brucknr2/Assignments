Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal is to provide the first experimental deescription of the              
              properties of a weakly interacting Bose gas in the quantum regime.             
              Substantial advances are reported in trapping and cooling atomic               
              hydrogen, as a result of which it is believed that the way is now              
              open to achieve the conditions for Bose-Einstein condensation.
