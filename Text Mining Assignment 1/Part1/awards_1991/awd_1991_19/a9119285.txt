              The PI requests funds for a CUEBS (Commission on Undergraduate

              authors of various CUEBS publications.  The topics to be addressed             
              are:  Biology in a liberal education, Biology for non-majors, the              
              role of modules and technology in biological education, the                    
              laboratory as a place to investigate, and preparing scientists to              
              become educators.
