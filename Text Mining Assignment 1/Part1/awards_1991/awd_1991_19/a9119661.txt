Abstract    :
                   Parasites are important selective factors in evolution,                   
              yet studies of their ecology and effects on bird host behavior                 
              have concentrated on colonial species.  This study will be the                 
              first documentation of the importance of a nest parasite to the

              western bluebirds breed in boxes which permit ready access to                  
              nests we can  measure experimentally the impact of blood-feeding

              effects as well as parental feeding behavior and nest-site choice

In addition, we will evaluate fly
