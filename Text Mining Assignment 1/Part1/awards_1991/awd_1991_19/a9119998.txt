Abstract    :
              This investigation will deal with spectroscopic and kinetic                    
              evaluation of the generation of arylnitrenium ions. Although                   
              the initial phase of the project will involve the photolysis of                
              anthranilium salts, it is expected that several new                            
              photochemical methods for the general production of                            
              arylnitrenium ions will eventually emerge. The study will                      
              center on the use of nanosecond laser flash photolysis, low                    
              temperature ESR spectroscopy, and molecular orbital                            
              calculations to provide unequivocal identification of                          
              arylnitrenium ions. A highlight of the work will be to define                  
              the spin-multiplicity of the nitrenium ions generated and the                  
              products formed from each spin state. The question of the                      
              existence of a singlet-triplet equilibrium will be answered and                
              the consequences for final product distribution will be                        
              delineated. The role of arylnitrenium ions in DNA damaging                     
              reactions will also be investigated by trapping of                             
              arylnitrenium ions with guanine to simulate carcinogenetic                     
              reactivity.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              This new grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                  
              work of Professor Daniel A. Falvey at the University of                        
              Maryland. The investigation will seek to analyze the reactivity                
              of very short lived molecules called nitrenium ions.                           
              Nitrenium ions, which possess a nitrogen with a positive                       
              charge, have received little attention and yet represent a                     
              potential class of reactive species with widespread utility in                 
              chemical processes induced by light. By using an instrument                    
              designed to take snap-shot ultraviolet absorption "pictures" of                
              transient chemical species which live a few billionths of a                    
              second, it will be possible to confirm the existence of                        
              arylnitrenium ions which have been implicated as the primary                   
              entities involved in the DNA damaging process of arylamines.
