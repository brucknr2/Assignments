Abstract    :
                   This grant in theoretical physics supports the research                   
              of Professors J. Sucher and R.N. Mohapatra at the University                   
              of Maryland.  The work of Sucher will address atomic physics                   
              problems including two-photon exchange forces, the                             
              relativistic two-body problem, and highly excited states of                    
              the helium atom.  The research of Mohapatra is concerned with                  
              extensions of the standard electro-weak model that will                        
              investigate quark condensates and neutrino masses and magnetic                 
              moments.
