Abstract    :
              The newly developed Current Driven Double Layer (CUDDL) code will              
              be used to investigate a number of outstanding questions relating              
              to current driven processes on auroral field lines.  The code                  
              includes upward and downward propagating oblique shear Alfven                  
              waves.  Physical parameters relevant to auroral field line proceses            
              will be modeled, including the magnitude and spatial variation of              
              plasma and current density and magnetic field.  These new runs will            
              enable tests of scaling laws suggested by analytic theory and                  
              provide more insight into the physics of processes such as soliton             
              and double layer formation, current filamentation, electron                    
              acceleration and heating.  The role of density gradients parallel              
              to the magnetic field will also be studied, making sure that the               
              critical current for instabilities lies in the simulation system.
