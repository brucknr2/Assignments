Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent research demonstrates that biparental inheritance of                    
              plastids (BIP) may be more common in the plant kingdom than                    
              previously thought.  Plastids are inherited biparentally in                    
              approximately 20% of angiosperm taxa studied.  Various hypotheses              
              have been presented to explain the basis for patterns of plastid               
              inheritance in plants,  however,  very little is understood                    
              regarding the evolutionary significance of these inheritance                   
              patterns.  Our research with alfalfa (Medicago sativa),  which                 
              exhibits regular BIP,  suggests that there may be fitness effects              
              associated with sporophyte plastid composition (maternal, paternal,            
              or biparental) in this species.  Plastids may also provide an                  
              energy source for the developing microgametophyte,  sperm or the               
              fertilized egg in species with BIP.  The research described here               
              would consider these two possible explanations for the existence               
              of the BIP.  Using sets of full-sib families with defined                      
              constitutions,  we propose to measure the effects of 1)  plastid               
              composition in sporophytes on basic physiological processes and                
              components of fitness in alfalfa.  Measurement would concentrate               
              on physiological traits influenced by plastid-nucleus interaction              
              and whole-plant characteristics that may reflect differences in                
              primary metabolism.
