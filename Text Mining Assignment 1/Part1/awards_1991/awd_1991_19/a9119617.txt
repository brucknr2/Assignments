Abstract    :
              This proposal is to investigate two main areas of solar research.              
              The first is an improvement in our current knowledge of the                    
              thermodynamic structure and dynamical motions of the solar                     
              interior through the application of the tools of helioseismology.              
              This goal will be reached through the continuation of an on-                   
              going, dedicated observing program which is located at the 60-                 
              Foot Solar Tower Telescope of the mount Wilson Observatory and                 
              through the continued analysis of the observations of solar                    
              oscillations which have already been obtained by that program.                 
              The second goal is the establishment of a two-station ground-                  
              based network for the observation of high-degree solar                         
              oscillations through the installation of an additional dedicated               
              observing system, which will be located at the Crimean                         
              Astrophysical Observatory in the USSR.  Through the installation               
              and operation of this second station the PI will foster a strong               
              collaboration between U.S. and Soviet helioseismologists and                   
              enhance the scientific return of our future U.S. observations                  
              beyond the return which we would get from the Mt. Wilson                       
              observations alone.  The observations of the sun's surface                     
              motions will be converted into measurements of the frequencies,                
              rotationally and magnetically induced frequency splittings,                    
              amplitudes and lifetimes of global solar oscillation modes.                    
              These results  will then be inverted to map the sun's internal                 
              sound speed and angular velocity as functions of radius and                    
              latitude.
