Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research takes a new approach to understanding the changes                
              occurring in solution chemistry during localized corrosion.  Ion               
              chromatography is employed to probe the progression of solution                
              chemistry within occluded cells.  Ion chromatography is capable of             
              detecting nanogram quantities of a wide variety of ions in solution            
              volumes as low as 10 microliters.  This technique permits the                  
              analysis of changes in solution chemistry at localized corrosion               
              sites such as in crevices.  New insights can be obtained into the              
              fundamental processes that control corrosion pit formation and                 
              propagation.  Surface analysis techniques (Auger spectroscopy and              
              X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) are used to examine the                      
              composition of passive films and surface corrosion layers that form            
              before and after the onset of corrosion.                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Localized corrosion of metals and alloys in aqueous environments is            
              an especially damaging form of environmental attack.  It has                   
              generally been accepted that the cause of the initiation and                   
              propagation of a localized corrosion site is the formation of a                
              highly aggressive environment in an occluded cell that comprises               
              the area of attack.  Understanding obtained from the approach                  
              described in this study could have a significant impact on the                 
              development of strategies for mitigating pitting and crevice                   
              corrosion.
