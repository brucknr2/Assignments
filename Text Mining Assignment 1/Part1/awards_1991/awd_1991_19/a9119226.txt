Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this Dissertation Improvement Award is to             
              study the facial skeleton in a group of early Miocene primates from            
              Africa and Saudi Arabia.  The group, the proconsulids, will be                 
              compared to early catarrhines and living anthropoids and the study             
              will cover the 24 million years of our history. It will allow the              
              refined use of facial characteristics for testing of proconsulid               
              phylogenetic relationships.  A series of metric and non-metric                 
              characteristics will be employed and a diagnostic characters of                
              each group will be determined.  This research will add to our                  
              understanding of the evolutionary relationships of the proconsulids            
              and add to the utility of facial characteristics in phylogenetic               
              studies.
