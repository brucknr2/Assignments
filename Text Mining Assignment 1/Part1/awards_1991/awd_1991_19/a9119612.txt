Abstract    :
                   Despite the fact that the potential exists for selection to               
              increase the frequency of resistance traits in both plant and                  
              insect populations, a substantial amount of genetic variation                  
              exists for such traits.  Such variation suggests that there may                
              be selective tradeoffs associated with the evolution of                        
              resistance.  One such tradeoff is the cost of resistance--that                 
              is, the reduced fitness of resistant genotypes in the Depressaria              
              pastinacella (parsnip webworm) and its host wild parsnip                       
              (Pastinaca sativa).  In this system, phytochemical resistance                  
              factors in the plant are known to exhibit genetic variation, as                
              are detoxicative qualitative data for refining theoretical                     
              expectations of plant-insect coevolution as well as for designing              
              and implementing resistance management programs in                             
              agroecosystems.
