Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds continuing development and operation of a unique              
              facility, the University of Minnesota Automated Plate Scanner.                 
              This device digitizes, at high speed, pairs of plates, such as                 
              those of the Palomar Sky Survey, permitting sophisticated func-                
              tions such as astrometry, photometry, and pattern recognition.                 
              In the next three years, digitization of the first Palomar Sky                 
              survey will be completed and made available, on line, to the                   
              astronomical community, and work will be started on the second                 
              Palomar survey, providing important comparison data.
