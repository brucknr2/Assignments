Abstract    :
              This study will result in rigorous inferences of phylogeny for the             
              marine diatom genus Skeletonema using molecular and morphometric               
              methods in a cladistic framework.  It is proposed that this genus              
              can serve as a model system for exploring methods and controversies            
              in the phylogeny reconstruction of primarily asexual organisms at              
              lower phylogenetic levels.  The following issues will be explored:             
              1. Levels of divergence among populations and species measured                 
              using chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), nuclear rDNA, and a single copy gene            
              nucDNA gene; 2. Relationships of gene trees and species trees at               
              lower phylogenetic levels; 3. Concordance of molecular and                     
              morphological data analyzed using phylogenetic systematic methods.             
              It is hypothesized that the most primitive members of the genus are            
              heavily silicified forms endemic to high-light, oligotrophic warm              
              marine environments and that the most derived members are lightly              
              silicified forms inhabiting turbid, eutrophic temperate freshwater             
              and brackish water environments.  The ecological importance and the            
              wealth of background data available for Skeletonema make it an                 
              ideal system in which to test hypotheses of adaptation in an                   
              historical context.
