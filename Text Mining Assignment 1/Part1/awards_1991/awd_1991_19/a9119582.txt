Abstract    :
              This research will explore an approach to the engineering of                   
              structural composite materials with enhanced intrinsic passive                 
              damping, and to develop appropriate modeling techniques and                    
              design guidelines.  The approach is based on the use of                        
              integrally-shunted piezoceramic rods as reinforcing elements of a              
              composite material.  Because of high electroelastic coupling,                  
              straining produces voltage gradients along the rods.  By shunting              
              the electroded rod ends through an integral resistor, current is               
              allowed to flow and dissipate energy through joule heating,  Very              
              high peak damping loss factors are theoretically attainable even               
              at low fiber volume fractions (20%) in epoxy.
