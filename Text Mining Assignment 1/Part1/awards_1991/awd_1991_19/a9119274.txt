Abstract    :
              This project will build and fly, over Antarctica, a balloon borne              
              instrument to measure the isotopic abundance of cosmic rays with               
              masses from neon through nickel.  The origin and evolution of                  
              elements and isotopes remains one of the central problems of                   
              astrophysics.  The data which this instrument will be used to                  
              investigate questions of cosmic ray origins and transport, and to              
              look for effects of ongoing nucleosynthesis on the chemical                    
              composition of the galaxy.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project will be jointly supported by NSF's Division of Polar              
              Programs and Physics and NASA's Space Physics Division.  NSF will              
              provide logistical support in Antarctica and NASA will provide                 
              balloon launch services.
