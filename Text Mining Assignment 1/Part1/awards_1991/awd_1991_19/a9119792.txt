Abstract    :
                   This grant provides continued partial core support of                     
              the activities of the Computer Science and Telecommunications                  
              Board (CSTB) of the National Academy of Sciences/National                      
              Research Council.  The CSTB maintains a membership of                          
              national leaders who address the health of U.S. computer                       
              science, computing technology, telecommunications, and                         
              applications.  The board has five basic functions: (1)                         
              Monitor and promote the health of computer science, computing                  
              technology, and telecommunications fields (including human                     
              resources and infrastructure); (2) Initiate studies involving                  
              those fields; (3) Provide advice to government, non-profit                     
              organizations, and private industry on computer and                            
              telecommunications systems planning, utilization, and                          
              modernization; (4) Foster communication among computer                         
              science, computing and telecommunications technologies,and                     
              other pure and applied science and technology; (5) Provide a                   
              base of expertise in these fields within the NRC.
