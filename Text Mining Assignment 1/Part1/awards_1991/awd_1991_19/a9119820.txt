Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Winthrop College requests support from NSF for connection of its               
              campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel network                    
              located in the southeastern area of the country and comprises 13               
              states.  It will provide operations management and information                 
              services and it will give Winthrop College a 56 thousand bits per              
              second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million                
              bits per second) National Backbone network.                                    
                                                                                             
              The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be                
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers              
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This                
              is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative              
              educational resources.***//
