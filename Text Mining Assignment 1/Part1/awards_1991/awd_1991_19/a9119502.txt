Abstract    :
                   The proposed research will study how muscle function and bone             
              movement (physiological features of organisms) correlate with                  
              structural (morphological) and behavioral features.  Most work to              
              date has focused on animal morphology, and relatively little                   
              research has been done on the physiological function of features               
              of organisms as these functions relate to morphology and behavior.             
              In particular, a general question of interest to comparative                   
              biologists will be addressed: how congruent are the distributions              
              of physiological and morphological characteristics in organisms?               
                   The muscles and bones of the head region in fishes will be                
              used as a model system to investigate this question.  With nearly              
              23,000 species, ray-finned fishes comprise more than half of all               
              vertebrates, and have proven to be an excellent model system for               
              the study of animal function in the past.  In addition, many of the            
              fish groups to be studied are of considerable economic importance              
              while others occur in regions of the world where there is great                
              concern for the loss of biodiversity.                                          
                   This research will contribute to our understanding of (1) the             
              utility of physiological data for testing comparative hypotheses               
              in biology, (2) the biomechanics of bone and muscle function in                
              vertebrates, and (3) our understanding of the biodiversity of the              
              largest group of vertebrates.
