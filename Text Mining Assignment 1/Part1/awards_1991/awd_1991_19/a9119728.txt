Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of bioanalysis.  During the tenure               
              of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Meyerhoff and his               
              students will pursue fundamental studies relating to the use of                
              enzymes as labels in several novel binding assay methods of                    
              analysis of biomolecules.  Three specific research thrusts                     
              utilizing enzyme-linked binding assays (ELBAs) will be pursued,                
              namely (1) the development and study of a new lectin-based                     
              homogeneous ELBA, with the specific intent of synthesizing more                
              useful enzyme-oligosaccharide conjugates and demonstrating that                
              such conjugate/lectin systems can be used to probe rapidly the                 
              carbohydrate structures of intact glycoproteins; (2) assessment of             
              the applicability and analytical limits of using multiple enzyme               
              labels in conjunction with multiple binders to perform                         
              simultaneous ELBAs of biolmolecules in a single mixture; and (3)               
              exploration of the feasibility of implementing in situ                         
              electrochemical release of substrates for potential use in ELBAs               
              for the detection of specific proteins.

              This research builds upon results obtained under NSF grant CHE-
