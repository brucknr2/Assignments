Abstract    :
                   A widely advocated mechanism for the evolution of                         
              reproductive isolation involves the co-evolution of                            
              sender/receiver communication systems between sexes.  This study               
              will test the hypothesis that male calling song and female mate                
              preference are genetically correlated in the two sibling ground                
              cricket species, Allonemobius fasciatus and A. socius.   Parent-               
              offspring and full sib quantitative genetic methods will be used               
              to assess the  degree to which inter-and intraspecific variation               
              in male calling song is correlated to variation in female                      
              preference of a male's calling song.  In addition, the                         
              heritability of female mate preference (as measured by phonotaxis              
              to male calling songs) will be estimated.  Knowledge of the                    
              heritability of female preference, and its genetic correlation                 
              with male calling song will provide insights concerning the speed              
              of response to past, present and future selective pressures; more              
              importantly, the absence of genetic variance could pose a                      
              fundamental constraint to the evolution of mate recognition                    
              systems.
