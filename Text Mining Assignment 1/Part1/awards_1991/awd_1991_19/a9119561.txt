Abstract    :
                   This study is a comparative anatomical study of the bowfin                
              fishes and their close relatives.  The group, named Amiiformes,                
              contains only a single living species, and several dozen extinct               
              (fossil) species in rocks dating as far back as 150 million years              
              before present.  (The living species, Amia calva, is called a                  
              "living fossil" by many paleontologists and zoologists.)  An                   
              integrative approach, looking at embryology (with the living                   
              species), paleontology, and comparative skeletal anatomy is used.              
              A search will be made to identify specialized morphological                    
              features unique to subgroups within Amiformes which suggest close              
              relationship among the species of those subgroups.                             
                                                                                             
                   This study may be able to show that Amia is an important model            
              for a better understanding of vertebrate embryology and anatomy.               
              The majority of the funds will be used for preparation of fossil               
              and living material, education (funding a 1-year postdoctoral                  
              position) and publication of the results in widely read scientific             
              journals.
