Abstract    :
              Structural studies will be carried out on the                                  
              quinoprotein-electron transfer system methylamine dehydrogenase                
              (MADH) from Paracoccus denitrificans by the methods of x-ray                   
              diffraction.  Three proteins are involved in this system, MADH,                
              amicyanin and cytochrome c551i.  MADH is a dimer of 124 kDa and                
              contains the unusual cofactor tryptophan tryptophylquinone.                    
              Amicyanin is a blue copper protein of 12.5 kDa which interacts                 
              specifically with MADH.  Cytochrome c551i is a 22 kDa protein                  
              which accepts electrons from amicyanin and transfers them via                  
              another cytochrome to a terminal oxidase.                                      
                                                                                             
              Crystals have been prepared of MADH, amicyanin, the binary                     
              complex of MADH with amicyanin and of the ternary complex of                   
              MADH, amicyanin and cytochrome c551i.  The structures of MADH and              
              the binary complex have been solved by molecular replacement to                
              2.8 A and 2.5 A resolution, respectively.  The structures of the               
              remaining crystal types and of the cytochrome by itself will be                
              determined.  The structures of all crystal types will be refined               
              by simulated annealing and energy minimization.  These structures              
              will be carefully analyzed using molecular graphics to determine               
              the catalytic mechanisms and details of the electron transfer                  
              processes.
