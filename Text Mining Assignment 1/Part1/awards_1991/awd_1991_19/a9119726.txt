Abstract    :
                   Theories of gravitation based on general relativity and                   
              theories of quantum fields in curved spacetime will be                         
              developed and applied to the study of gravitational, quantum                   
              and statistical processes in the early universe, with the goal                 
              of understanding the origin, dynamics and the structure of our                 
              universe.  Problems to be investigated include:                                
                   I.   Quantum Cosmology and Semiclassical Gravity                          
                   II.  Inflationary Cosmology and Phase Transitions                         
                   III. Stochastic Quantum Fields and Cosmology                              
                   IV.  Stochasticity and Complexity in Spacetime                            
                        Structures                                                           
                   V.   Harmonic Analysis and Quantum Fields in Curved                       
                        Space                                                                
                   These studies will use the best available theoretical                     
              models of gravitation to determine the important phenomena                     
              produced in the earliest epochs.
