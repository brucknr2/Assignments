Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will aid in purchasing a state-of-the-art high energy,                         
              multi-sector, tandem mass spectrometer in the Department of                    
              Chemistry at the Emory University.  The research studies to be                 
              performed include investigating structures of polyoxometalates                 
              and the chemistry of radical cations, structures of unusual                    
              peptides and peptides from enzymatic cleavages of proteins,                    
              structures of synthetic and unknown naturally-occuring                         
              sphingoid bases and related biomolecules (e.g.,                                
              glycosphingolipids), and structures of synthetic lipids and                    
              host molecules.  One investigator is investigating fundamental                 
              aspects of gas-phase ion chemistry and is developing methods in                
              analytical mass spectrometry.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate                   
              structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of                 
              a vast array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic                         
              molecules.  The range of tandem-mass spectrometic analysis                     
              affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available                   
              for the characterization of compounds.  The acquisition of this                
              capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the                           
              prosecution of frontier research in many fields of chemistry.
