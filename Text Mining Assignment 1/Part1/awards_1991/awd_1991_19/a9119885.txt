Abstract    :
              The physiology, behavior, and survival of Weddell seals in their               
              first year of life is the subject of this scientific investigation.            
              For Weddell seals, this period encompasses the brief period of                 
              maternal dependence (6 weeks), development of swimming and diving              
              abilities and dispersal from natal colonies as shore-fast ice turns            
              to pack ice and open water.  It is the least known aspect of the               
              life cycle of any mammal and likely to be the most important period            
              affecting their survival to adulthood and eventual reproductive                
              success.  The following areas will be emphasized:  1) physical and             
              physiological changes related to maternal investment, weaning, and             
              development of diving abilities; 2) the ontogeny of diving behavior            
              and dispersal of pups in their first year using satellite                      
              telemetry.   3) comparative study of diving and movements by older             
              juveniles (1-2 years old) using satellite telemetry.  4)                       
              correlative study of the maternal, physical, physiological and                 
              behavioral factors that affect the movements, condition                        
              possibly the survival of pups in their first year of life; and                 
              5) continued measurement of population size, survival rates and                
              productivity of Weddell seals in McMurdo Sound as a continued long             
              term study of their population dynamics and context for                        
              interpreting interannual variation in condition or behavior of                 
              juveniles.
