Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to develop a global eddy-resolving thermodynamic                
              ocean circulation model using state of the art computational                   
              methods.  This model describes the wind-driven and upper ocean                 
              thermohaline circulations but not the overturning "conveyor-belt"              
              thermohaline circulation.  The results of the numerical                        
              computations will be made available to the oceanographic                       
              community for further analysis and comparison with field data.
