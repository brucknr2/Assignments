Abstract    :
              Many plants are known to increase the intracellular levels of                  
              phenolic compounds when they are challenged by a wide variety of               
              stressful conditions including predation.  Many phenolic compounds             
              are toxic to a wide variety of biotic agents.  In order for plants             
              to use this defense mechanism, the species must be able to tolerate            
              the increased level of the phenolic.  Plants reduce the                        
              autotoxicity of phenolics by conjugating them to other cellular                
              constituents.  It has been recently noted that plants may conjugate            
              some phenolics to glutathione through the action of a glutathione              
              S-transferase.  Preliminary evidence indicates that the activity               
              of the enzyme may be regulated by phenolic levels.  The objectives             
              of this project are to: 1) characterize the glutathione S-                     
              transferase enzyme; 2) determine if plants synthesize glutathione              
              conjugates of phenolics in vivo; and 3) determine if there is a                
              correlation between stress and glutathione S-transferase activity.             
              An understanding of the role of glutathione in phenolic conjugation            
              will aid in the understanding of how plants utilize phenolics                  
              during times of stress and may provide insight into the endogenous             
              function of plants GST enzymes.
