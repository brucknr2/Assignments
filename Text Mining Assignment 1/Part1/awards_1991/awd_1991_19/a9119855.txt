Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to continue studies of the structure, evolution,               
              and function of cephalopod hemocyanins with limited extension                  
              of recent work on Octopus hemocyanin and major new projects                    
              involving the hemocyanins of Nautilus and of the squid Loligo.                 
              Initially, certain ongoing studies of Octopus hemocyanin will                  
              be brought to completion.  These include experiments utilizing                 
              cleaved subunits as tools in exploration of functional behavior.               
              A detailed analysis of the subunit structure of the Nautilus and               
              Loligo hemocyanins will be undertaken, to provide the kind of                  
              complete structural picture the PI has developed for Octopus. The              
              number of kinds of polypeptide chains involved in each case, and               
              the number of functional units in each chain will be determined.               
              The roles of multiple chain types in assembly will be assessed.                
              Limited peptide sequencing will be carried out in order to allow               
              alignment of the Loligo and Nautilus units with those of Octopus               
              and with those in gastropod hemocyanins.  If time and funds permit,            
              a re-examination of the oxygen-binding function and allostery of               
              Loligo hemocyanin is proposed, since early studies indicated a                 
              remarkable oxygen-linked dissociation process.  This slow process              
              should allow the first kinetic studies on a hemocyanin dissociation            
              reaction.
