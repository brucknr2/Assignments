Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this proposal is to understand how totipotency, the                
              ability to undergo embryogenesis, is restricted to a single cell               
              lineage in the eukaryote Volvox carteri.  Volvox is ideal for                  
              dissecting the mechanisms underlying the regulation of                         
              totipotency since it is composed of only two types of cells:                   
              reproductive and somatic.  In asexual (clonal) growth,                         
              reproductive cells cleave successively yielding a new embryo                   
              while somatic cells never divide.  A number of mutants that alter              
              cell fate have defined critical genes in the determination                     
              pathway.  In regA - mutants, somatic cells redifferentiate into                
              reproductive cells and become totipotent.  The locus is unusual                
              in that it becomes hypermutable (105 times the spontaneous rate)               
              at a specific stage in development. The primary aim is to                      
              determine how the regA gene normally keeps the somatic cell                    
              lineage from undergoing embryogenesis and why it is transiently                
              hypermutable.  The PI has devised two powerful new methods to                  
              isolate the regA gene: genomic subtraction and DAF                             
              (differentially amplified fragment) subtraction.  To begin to                  
              understand how regA regulates totipotency, cloned gene will be                 
              used in studies to determine the nature of the regA gene product               
              and the molecular basis for the unusual hypermutability of the                 
              gene.
