Abstract    :
                   Large-magnitude intracontinental extension in the Death Valley            
              region of California has been modeled by using pre-extensional                 
              markers such as pre-Tertiary thrust faults and Paleozoic strati-               
              graphic trends.  The model indicates that extension across the                 
              region was accommodated by wholesale separation of the upper 15 km             
              of the continental crust along a discrete, west-dipping zone of                
              normal faults less than 10 km in width.  During the ensuing 150km              
              of pull apart, deep crust rose isostatically and filled the void               
              left between the separating blocks.  Volumetrically minor fault                
              slivers were sequentially transferred from the hanging wall block              
              to the detached slivers and apparent cessation of major extension              
              migrated westward with the hanging wall.  This project will use                
              structural mapping, paleomagnetism and thermochronology of the                 
              slivers to rigorously test this model.  Results are of importance              
              to south-western U.S. tectonics and to the general process of                  
              large-scale continental extension.
