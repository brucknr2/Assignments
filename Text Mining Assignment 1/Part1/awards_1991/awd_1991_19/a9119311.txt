Abstract    :
                   In many species of flowering plants, rates of outcrossing                 
              and gen dispersal vary markedly across a range of spatial scales.              
              Researchers have often attributed this variation to ecological                 
              factors that influence pollinator movements.  However, very                    
              little is known about the ways in which these variables affect                 
              the mating system of individual plants.  The proposed research                 
              investigates the influence of population density on patterns of                
              paternity in Mimulus ringens.  This native perennial is readily                
              cloned, facilitating the establishment of replicate populations                
              of genetically distinct individuals.  All plants in each                       
              experimental population will have unique enzyme phenotypes,                    
              permitting assignment of paternity to all sampled offspring.                   
              Studies of pollinator movements, flowering phenology, and seed                 
              yield will be combined with detailed paternity data to test a                  
              series of predictions derived from ecological and evolutionary                 
              theory.  In addition, this study will provide an exceptionally                 
              detailed description of individual variation in outcrossing                    
              rates, gene dispersal, and male fertility and will document the                
              influence of ecological factors on the patterns observed.
