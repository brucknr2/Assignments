Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with a fundamental problem solving                  
              method - heuristic search, and an important heuristic search                   
              algorithm - the best-first search.  A new best-first search                    
              algorithm is developed, whose memory requirement is only linear                
              in the search depth, at the cost of expanding some nodes more                  
              than once.  The algorithm runs faster than classical best-first                
              search due to its simple structure and reduced overhead.  It                   
              removes the memory limitation of best-first search, and opens up               
              a host of new applications: combinatorial optimization problems,               
              optimal decisions under real-time constraints, selective search                
              algorithms for two-player games, and difficult constraints                     
              satisfaction problems.
