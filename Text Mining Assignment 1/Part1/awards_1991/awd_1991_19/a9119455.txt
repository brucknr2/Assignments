Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist studying the struggle of a dependent, Caribbean                 
              society to define its identity with respect to the dominant                    
              European society.  The research will take place on Martinique, a               
              "department" of the French nation.  Using participant                          
              observation, interviewing of government officials, and studying                
              popular culture, the student will try to understand how local                  
              Martinique bureaucrats in charge of cultural affairs define their              
              cultural life with respect to the hegemony of France, and how                  
              ordinary people deal with the issue of their "own" nationalism                 
              and their status as French colonial citizens.                                  
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the problem of national                     
              identity is critical for ex-colonial nations in the third world.               
              This case study of public officials and plain citizens deals with              
              the problems of establishing a positive identity with respect to               
              the dominant Western ex-colonial power.  It can help us                        
              understand similar situations in other geographic regions.  With               
              the breakdown of the USSR empire local cultural conflicts will                 
              increase in importance, and any increase in our understanding of               
              the sources of conflicts about cultural identity can help                      
              decision makers deal with them.
