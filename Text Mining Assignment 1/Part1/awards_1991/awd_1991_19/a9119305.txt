Abstract    :
              A three day symposium, entitled "Marine Bioinorganic                           
              Chemistry" will be held at the National American Chemical                      
              Society Meeting/4th Chemical Congress of North America,                        
              August 25-30, 1991 in New York City.  The purpose of this                      
              symposium is to bring together biochemists, inorganic                          
              chemists, bioinorganic chemists, chemical and biological                       
              oceanographers and civil/environmental engineers to discuss                    
              the recent developments in the emerging field of marine                        
              bioinorganic chemistry.  Many novel metalloenzymes, metal                      
              binding ligands, inorganic compounds and biomolecules.                         
              Because the transition metal composition of the ocean is now                   
              relatively well defined, the study of the bioinorganic                         
              chemistry of the oceans has now become feasible.  By bringing                  
              together scientists from the fields listed above, this                         
              symposium is likely to stimulate new ideas, interests and                      
              collaborations in this emerging field.
