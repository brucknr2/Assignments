Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for a Workshop on Active Vision                      
              Research, to be held in Chicago, Illinois on August 5-7, 1991 to               
              take advantage of the occurrence of the Annual Meeting of the                  
              Cognitive Science Society in Chicago immediately following the                 
              Workshop.  A growing number of researchers recognize that the                  
              ability to actively combine computer vision with                               
              physical/mechanical behavior is vital to achieving useful and                  
              robust perception for a robot interacting with a complex, dynamic              
              world.  In this paradigm, termed active vision, the vision                     
              process is mist readily understood in the context of the                       
              behaviors that the system is engaged in; these behaviors may not               
              require elaborate categorical representations of the three-                    
              dimensional world.  Thirty leading researchers will meet to                    
              discuss research opportunities and funding needs in this emerging              
              field.  They will discuss the motivations for active vision,                   
              recommend research priorities, and identify important influences               
              on the field, such as emerging computer, camera, and robotic                   
              technologies.
