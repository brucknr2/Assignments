Abstract    :
              This research project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                 
              Program, will study the interaction of adsorbed molecules with                 
              heterogeneous catalysts, using solid-state deuterium NMR                       
              methods at high magnetic fields.  Deuterium and various                        
              deuterated hydrocarbon molecules will be studied, adsorbed                     
              primarily on alumina supported platinum and rhodium catalysts.                 
              Questions concerning hydride exchange, C-H bond activation,                    
              charge transfer between adsorbate and substrate, and adsorbate                 
              mobility will be addressed.  In addition, very high field low                  
              temperature studies of quadrupolar coupling constants will be                  
              carried out.  An attempt will also be made to obtain an NMR                    
              spectrum for a monolayer adsorbed on a single crystal metal                    
              surface.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              An understanding of the structure and reactivity of molecules                  
              adsorbed on the surface of catalytic materials is essential to                 
              the design and use of heterogeneous catalytic processes.  This                 
              research program will develop powerful nuclear magnetic                        
              resonance spectroscopic methods for the determination of the                   
              structure of adsorbed molecules on catalytic surfaces.  This                   
              structural information will allow the design and understanding                 
              of catalytic systems crucial to the chemical industry and to                   
              pollution abatement technologies.
