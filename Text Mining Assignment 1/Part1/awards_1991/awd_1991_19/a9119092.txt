Abstract    :
                   The expulsion of fluids from deforming orogenic belts is an               
              important subject and has received considerable attention.  The                
              purpose of this study is to examine fluid flow in the central                  
              Appalachian foreland fold-thrust belt, determine fluid migration               
              pathways and changes in fluid composition and temperature with                 
              time.  Study of fluid inclusions found in veins will be the primary            
              method used to determine regional fluid chemistry, equilibration               
              temperatures and isotopic composition.  Data gathered will be                  
              incorporated into foreland hydrologic and thermal models.
