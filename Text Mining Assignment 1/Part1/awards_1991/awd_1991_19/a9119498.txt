Abstract    :
                   Professor Huennekens and his graduate students will embark                
              on a series of experiments exploring collisional and radiative                 
              processes in alkali and alkaline-earth vapors.  These studies                  
              will include determination of the alkali dimer excited-state                   
              potentials, a novel method of elucidating the nature of velocity-              
              changing collisions, and investigation of predicted excimer bands              
              in barium-noble gas molecules.
