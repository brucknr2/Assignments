Abstract    :
                   This work in theoretical physics will address                             
              foundational problems in the theory of relativistic strings.                   
              It will study space-time supersymmetric nonlinear sigma                        
              models, a superspace formulation of space-time supersymmetry                   
              and the possibility of new types of superspace structures                      
              related to integrable self-dual Yangs-Mills theories.
