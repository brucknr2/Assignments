Abstract    :
                Todd J. Martinez has been awarded a Minority Graduate                        
              Assistantship in Chemistry.  The Minority Graduate                             
              Assistantships in Chemistry are viewed as an infrastructural                   
              investment designed to broaden the participation, knowledge,                   
              and experience of students who are members of minority groups                  
              underrepresented in Chemistry, and attract them into meaningful                
              careers in chemical research and teaching.

              Mr. Martinez has a B.S. degree from Calvin College and is                      
              currently in the Ph.D. program at UCLA in the area of                          
              Theoretical Chemistry.  His research adviser, Prof. Emily                      
              Carter, writes that he has worked out the equations to do the                  
              configuration interaction problem using Friesner's                             
              pseudospectral method. In his proposed plan of research he                     
              describes the Monte Carlo calculations of the electronic                       
              structure of iron dimer.
