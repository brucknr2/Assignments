Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this work is to                                            
              demonstrate the realistic potential                                            
              of advanced adaptive critic designs                                            
              -- a general approach to intelligent                                           
              control which may be crucial to                                                
              understanding and replicating                                                  
              biological intelligence.                                                       
                                                                                             
              There exists a domain of problems                                              
              which require large-scale                                                      
              decentralized control of complex                                               
              non-linear dynamics.  The use of                                               
              hydrogen as both fuel and coolant in                                           
              hypersonic vehicles, such as the                                               
              National Aerospace Plane (NASP),                                               
              presents such a problem.  The NASP                                             
              will use hydrogen fuel to cool the                                             
              engine and remove the excessive heat                                           
              on the vehicle surface caused by                                               
              high energy air flow during                                                    
              hypersonic flight.  In the thermal                                             
              management system, the hydrogen flow                                           
              patterns and routing schemes for                                               
              cooling such a vehicle incorporate                                             
              multiple levels of tiered                                                      
              distribution.  However, there exist                                            
              severe weight penalties in a large                                             
              scale system which requires and                                                
              abundance of fuel and high pressure                                            
              valves necessary to cool the most                                              
              extreme temperatures which appear                                              
              only in local areas or "hot spot".                                             
              Unless coolant can be efficiently                                              
              and actively controlled to cool                                                
              these local areas, the weight                                                  
              penalties could prevent orbital                                                
              capability.  Since flow is regulated                                           
              through the valved adjustment of

              parallel and/or series, and                                                    
              decentralized control approach will                                            
              provide a method to globally

              valves.  A decentralized control
