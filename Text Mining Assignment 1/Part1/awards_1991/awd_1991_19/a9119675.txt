Abstract    :
              The goal of this program is to develop a microscopic description of            
              metal surface phase behavior, especially at elevated temperatures              
              where the role of fluctuations is expected to be important.  By                
              means of high-resolution x-ray scattering, the researchers will                
              investigate roughening, metal facetting and surface-melting                    
              transformations of both reconstructed and unreconstructed surfaces.            
                                                                                             
              In addition the two-dimensional phase transformations associated               
              with reconstructions will be investigated.  The program will                   
              contribute to a detailed, microscopic understanding of the                     
              statistical physics of real metal surfaces.  In particular, it will            
              contribute to our understanding of the morphology of metal surfaces            
              versus temperatures and to our understanding of the thermal                    
              behavior of metal equilibrium crystal shapes.
