Abstract    :
              The Federation of American Research Networks (FARNET) will                     
              initiate collaborative programs among mid-level networks aimed at              
              enhancing the national networking infrastructure, extending the                
              breadth of NSFNET participation, increasing the usefulness of                  
              network connectivity, and providing information for management                 
              and development of the national networking program.  The                       
              requested support will permit the assignment of professional                   
              management and staff resources to implement these programs so                  
              that the efforts of the regional and other midlevel network                    
              participants can be coordinated.
