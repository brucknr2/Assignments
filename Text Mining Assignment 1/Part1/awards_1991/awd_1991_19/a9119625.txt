Abstract    :
              In this project in Experimental Physical Chemistry , Prof.                     
              Strauss (U.C. Berkeley)  will use infrared spectroscopy to                     
              study intermolecular interactions in condensed phases. Spectral                
              hole-burning will be used to study the flow of vibrational                     
              energy in solids at low temperatures. Prototype rotational                     
              processes and conformational changes occuring on a slow time                   
              scale will be studied theoretically as well as experimentally.                 
              Systems to be studied include selectively deuterated ammonium                  
              ions,amorphous films of hydrocarbons and perfluorinated                        
              hydrocarbons, and hydrogen/ice inclusion compounds.                            
              %%%                                                                            
              Hydrogen dissolved in water ice is thought to be a constituent                 
              of cold planets and their moons. By studying the properties of                 
              this and similar systems in the laboratory, Prof. Strauss (UC                  
              Berkeley) will add to our chemical knowledge in a highly cost                  
              effective manner. Information obtained by his spectroscopic                    
              studies will aid in interpreting chemical data sent from                       
              planetary space probes.
