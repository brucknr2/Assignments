Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is concerned with the further development and                     
              application of a model for disclinations, which are faults, or                 
              defects, in the spatial orientation of liquid crystals. These                  
              disclinations can be dynamically generated in flowing liquid                   
              crystal systems. The research is concerned with multiple                       
              interacting disclinations, including their generation and                      
              anihilation. Disclination arrays will determine the effective                  
              structure and properties of media with flow-induced                            
              orientation faults in microscopic structure. Under a prior                     
              grant, the dynamics of a single isolated disclination was                      
              modeled.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              These phenomena are of great importance in the processing of                   
              advanced liquid crystal polymers, as for instance in the                       
              production of highly oriented high strength fibers.
