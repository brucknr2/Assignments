Abstract    :
              This grant provides logistical support and travel funds to operate             
              a Extreme Low and Very Low Frequency (ELF/VLF) radiometer at the               
              radio-quiet Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI                          
              Arrival Heights, Antarctica.  The radiometer is one of seven nearly            
              identical which Stanford University operates at different site                 
              around the world, including two other high geomagnetic latitude                
              sites (Thule and Sondrestromfjord, Greenland).  It is the purpose              
              of the measurement to develop a long-term climatology of naturally             
              occurring radio noise in the 5 Hz to 30 kHz range.  There are, of              
              course, practical reasons to measure the natural background, for it            
              sets limits on the usefulness of this frequency range for                      
              communications.                                                                
                                                                                             
              These investigators are leaders in the measurement and                         
              interpretation of ELF/VLF radio waves.                                         
                                                                                             
              The Office of Naval Research provides funds for the research                   
              activities of this group while NSF provides logistical support and             
              travel funds for the Antarctic portion of the project.
