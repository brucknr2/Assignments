Abstract    :
                This research is to utilize digitized core phases PKP generated              
              by earthquakes to study the inner core where some evidence of                  
              anisotropy has been found, and the core-mantle boundary where                  
              heterogeneity is known but poorly resolved.  Data are extracted                
              from CD-ROMS distributed by the National Earthquake Information                
              Center and from the IRIS data center.  In order to remove effects              
              of mantle hetereogeneities and earthquake source mislocations,                 
              the research will utilize differential measurements between                    
              phases with similar paths in the mantle.  Both amplitudes and                  
              times will be used to analyze inner core structure along the                   
              earth's spin axis.  The results will be used to constrain                      
              theories of anisotropy and heterogeneity in the inner core and                 
              core-mantle boundary regions.
