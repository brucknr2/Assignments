Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This objective of this project is to assess the field of                       
              "Epitaxy, Interfaces, Defects, and Processing of Electronic and                
              Photonic Materials."  A workshop will be held with presentations by            
              prominent scientists actively working in the field.  The workshop              
              will encompass the following topics:  Fundamental aspects of two-              
              and three-dimensional growth; Atomic structure of interfaces and               
              defects; Growth and processing of electronic and photonic materials            
              using novel concepts.  The basic idea of the workshop is to                    
              delineate the critical scientific issues pertaining to these                   
              topics, and to discuss approaches or techniques needed to address              
              them.  A written report will be prepared and disseminated.
