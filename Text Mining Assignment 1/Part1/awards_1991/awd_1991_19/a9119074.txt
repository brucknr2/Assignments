Abstract    :
                   This ongoing research effort on job shop scheduling explores              
              three generic problems in the manufacturing industry.  The first               
              problem is to schedule products with bills of materials to improve             
              on-time deliveries of products.  The second problem pertains to the            
              scheduling of facilities capable of batch processing several jobs              
              concurrently, such as an oven or a plating facility.  Since these              
              facilities are often expensive and have long processing times, they            
              constitute bottlenecks in many manufacturing systems.  The                     
              scheduling of a flexible manufacturing cell (FMC) is the third                 
              problem for study.                                                             
                   The purpose of this research is to obtain an efficient,                   
              effective and consistent solution methodology for scheduling                   
              general job shops.  Through extensive collaboration, an                        
              optimization-based scheduling methodology using the Lagrangian                 
              relaxation technique has been developed.  The method has many                  
              positive features, and has been tested at the Development                      
              Operations shop of a major aerospace manufacturer.  The abilities              
              to handle bills of materials, batch facilities, and FMC's, however,            
              are of crucial importance for the method to be truly effective for             
              general job shops.  This research will thus advance the state of               
              the art and practice of scheduling methodology, and enhance the                
              profit-making ability of many manufacturing companies.
