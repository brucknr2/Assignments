Abstract    :
              This project explores complex interactions between cruciferous                 
              plants, one of their most important herbivores, the diamondback                
              moth, Plutella xylostella, and its major parasitoid, Diadegma                  
              insulare.  The diamondback moth is a major, world-wide pest of                 
              crucifer crops.  The work examines the role of variable sex                    
              ratios in parasitoids and their herbivorous hosts in population                
              regulation and dynamics of 3-trophic level systems.  It                        
              concentrates on direct and indirect effects of plants on                       
              interactions between herbivbores and parasitoids and tests the                 
              hypothesis that interactions between sex-ratio variation and                   
              plant preferences of the moths and wasps provide a mechanism for               
              density-dependent regulation of herbivore populations over                     
              several generations.  The project will provide detailed estimated              
              of the effects of plants on both herbivore and comprehensive                   
              dynamic models.  The work is relevant to questions of stability                
              of parasitoid-host dynamics and to biological control in an                    
              economically important system.
