Abstract    :
                   The general objectives of this proposal are to relate the                 
              phylogenetic trees derived from molecular sequences from extant                
              taxa to the geological, paleontological, and biochemical records;              
              to changes in the atmosphere and biota; and to the origin of                   
              present day life.  Three specific objectives are: (1) to test                  
              theories for the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus and to seek to               
              identify its prokaryotic sister taxon; (2) to relate phylogenetic              
              trees to the origin of metabolic innovations, such as the                      
              beginnings of photosynthesis, oxygen production, methanogenesis,               
              and sulfur reduction and oxidation; and (3) to relate the                      
              phylogenetic tree to the fossil and geological records, through                
              correlation with such factors as the time of appearance of oxygen              
              in the atmosphere, the isotopic abundances of sulfur and carbon,               
              the appearance of prokaryotic fossils, and with endosymbiotic                  
              events.                                                                        
                   Specific goals are to sequence three molecules (EF-Tu, Ef-G,              
              and the trp B gene) from a diverse group of twelve taxa that                   
              exhibit metabolic innovations that are essential to understanding              
              early events in life.  Phylogenetic trees will be inferred, paying             
              particular attention to artifacts of sequence alignment deriving               
              unrooted phylogenetic trees from molecular sequences.  The EF-Tu               
              and trp B genes are particularly useful because they have low rates            
              of nucleotide substitution and because EF-Tu and EF-G arose through            
              an early gene duplication so that the tree can be rooted using                 
              these paralogous genes.  Taxa have been chosen to assist in                    
              identifying the sister taxon to the eukaryotic nucleus, and to be              
              useful in asking what were the earliest types of metabolisms.
