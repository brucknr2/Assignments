Abstract    :
                   This is an SGER (Small Grants for Exploratory Research)                   
              award.  Tropical tidal flat deposits of the Western Atlantic may               
              contain a unique strip-chart-like record of variations in climate              
              during the past few thousand years.  The locally-adhesive                      
              surfaces of these flats act like fly-paper to retain aerosols                  
              from Africa and centimeter-thick layers of marine sediment record              
              the passage of hurricanes.  Both the frequency of hurricanes and               
              the flux of aerosols from Africa reflect global-scale variations               
              in climate.                                                                    
                   To explore this potential record of climate variations, a                 
              series of cores will be collected for sediments that have                      
              accumulated continuously for the past 3000 years or more.  The                 
              sediment layers that record major storms will be logged and their              
              compositions determined; the aerosols will be extracted from the               
              inter-storm algal layers, weighed and their compositions                       
              determined by x-ray diffraction and optical microscopy.  To date               
              the storm layers and determine rates of accumulation of aerosols,              
              sections of the cores will be dated by radiocarbon and possibly                
              with thorium230.                                                               
                   This pilot project may produce a local record of hurricane                
              frequency and the flux of aerosols and by applying the method to               
              other tidal flat deposits, it is possible to develop the record                
              of a much larger area.  This exploratory research is important                 
              because, if successful, it will provide information of storm                   
              frequency under different global climate regimes.
