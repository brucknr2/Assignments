Abstract    :
              This award supports studies to obtain high precision bulk and trace            
              element and mineral chemistry data on a large suite of Antarctic               
              ordinary chondrite meteorites.  These data will serve the dual                 
              purpose of proper characterization of these samples and                        
              determination of the reality of resolvable compositional                       
              differences between Antarctic finds and non-Antarctic observed                 
              falls.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This work will include high-precision instrumental neutron                     
              activation analysis studies of 25 elements in 24 Victoria Land H-              
              chondrites.  To eliminate run-specific analytical biases, H-                   
              chondrite falls will be included in each neutron activation run,               
              and to improve precision, each meteorite will be analyzed in                   
              duplicate.  The electron probe data will focus on the existence                
              of additional ordinary chondrites with properties intermediate                 
              between those of established groups.  These data will help in                  
              determining the existence of additional ordinary chondrite                     
              groups.
