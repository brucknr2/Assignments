Abstract    :
              Boiling is one of the most important and complex heat transfer                 
              mechanisms.  Recent focus on heat dissipation problems for                     
              submicron electronic circuits brings new motivation for better                 
              understanding of boiling.  This project concerns studies of                    
              direct phase change and nucleation processes on                                
              microconfigured silicon substrates.  Recent studies by the PI                  
              employing 11.5 m features at a density range of 0.4 - 2 (10)5                 
              per cm2 showed a 350% boiling enhancement in water and the                     
              elimination of hysterias and overshoot in FC-72.  Future                       
              studies include effects of microfeature spacing, geometry and                  
              surface treatments, development of a more realistic model,                     
              micro-second level visualization, and the measurement of                       
              temperature fluctuations.  Subcooled boiling measurements will                 
              also be made.
