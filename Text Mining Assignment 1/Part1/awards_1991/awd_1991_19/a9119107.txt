Abstract    :
              The powdery mildew disease of barley, caused by the obligate fungal            
              pathogen Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei, offers several advantages            
              for the study of host genes mediating resistance.  This disease has            
              been studied intensively for more than 50 years; thus, there is an             
              extensive base of physiological data and genetic materials                     
              available that is unmatched by most other host/pathogen systems.               
              The barley M1-a locus is of particular interest in that more than              
              30 resistance alleles have been identified at this locus.  By                  
              screening 118,000 M2 seedlings, I have isolated 41 partially or                
              fully susceptible mutants.  Complementation analysis of these new              
              alleles will be used to determine the genetic structure of the M1-a            
              locus, which may represent either a complex locus or cluster of                
              tightly linked genes.  Also, the mutants will be exploited in                  
              subtractive hybridization experiments to isolate M1-a cDNA clones.             
              No such disease resistance gene has been cloned from any plant.                
                                                                                             
              Analysis of the M1-a clones will provide information about the                 
              nature of the allelic variation at the M1-a locus and about the                
              biochemical role of the M1-a gene product in mediating disease                 
              resistance.***//
