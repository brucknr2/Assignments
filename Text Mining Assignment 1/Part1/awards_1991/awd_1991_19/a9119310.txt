Abstract    :
                Knowledge Base Management Systems (KBMS) based on Description                
              Logics perform deductions with intensional descriptions, thus                  
              providing novel services, and now finding commercial applications.             
              This research considers facilitating the specification and                     
              implementation of a family of such KBMS, through the extension of              
              a core system, ProtoDL, by the addition of new description                     
              constructors.  Specifically, the objectives include (i) a formal               
              notation for specifying the semantics of Description Logics; (ii)              
              a system, with a score of procedures that need to be completed for             
              every new constructor being added to the KBMS; (iii) heuristics                
              linking the implementation and specification.  Thereafter, given a             
              particular application (in the domain of Software Information                  
              Systems --- the chosen area for experiments), the prospective KB               
              developer determines suitable extensions to the description                    
              language and its inferences, with the help of a "knowledge language            
              engineer"; the latter then augments the ProtoDL implementation by              
              filling in and modifying the appropriate procedures/modules.  The              
              advantages of such extensible KBMS include: (1) meeting the need of            
              many practical applications for domain-dependent constructors                  
              (e.g., dealing with time, plans, etc.); (2) a novel approach to the            
              expressiveness vs.  computational intractability stand-off:                    
              starting with a limited language and extending it in an                        
              application-dependent way.
