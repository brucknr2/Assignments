Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Shared Research Instrumentation                  
              Program will help the Department of Chemistry at the University                
              of Wyoming to acquire a graphics computer system.  The areas of                
              chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition                     
              include:                                                                       
                                                                                             
              1.  Charge-Transfer Complexes as Probes of Steric Congestion

              3.  Spider Silk Protein Structure Function                                     
                                                                                             
              4.  Electronic Structures of Solid State and Molecular                         
                  Metal Sulfides                                                             
                                                                                             
              5.  An Investigation of the Electronic Properties of

              6.  Remote Participation During Photooxidation at Sulfur                       
                                                                                             
              Chemists carrying out frontier research are relying more and                   
              more on computers that are capable of handling sophisticated                   
              simulations, data analysis and graphics software.  The need to                 
              accomodate multiple users on the single laboratory computer and                
              multiple users on a single chemistry department facility can be                
              met by a single solution:  individual work stations for the                    
              majority of user needs and, for the remainder, ready access to                 
              other types of work stations and, ultimately, to a mini                        
              supercomputer.
