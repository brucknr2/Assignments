Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This speculative research is concerned with the preparation of a               
              new family of materials called CRYPTATIUMs derived from complexes              
              between organic ligand (cryptands) and metal cations called                    
              cryptates.  These compounds can be described as internal or                    
              "intramolecular radical anion-cation pairs."  The metal is bond by             
              an organic ligand which at the same time contains on or more                   
              unpaired electrons.  These materials will be generated by reduction            
              of appropriate metal cryptates and will be characterized both in               
              solution and solid phase with cyclic voltametry, coulometry, ESR,              
              electronic spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, etc.  The                       
              significance of CRYPTATIUMs as electronic materials remains to be              
              explored.
