Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is directed at learning more about how coordination              
              problems are solved.  The analysis is motivated in part by a desire            
              to understand the striking, persistent patterns of discrimination              
              among Nash equilibria observed in some recent coordination                     
              experiments; these patterns varied systematically with the number              
              of players and the payoff function, in ways that cannot be                     
              explained by traditional equilibrium refinements.  The basic                   
              premise of the research is that, because players in coordination               
              games are normally uncertain about how other players will respond              
              to their multiplicity of equilibria, learning from experience in               
              repeated play is likely to play a decisive role in determining                 
              outcomes.  The first step is to develop a realistic but tractable              
              model of the learning process that shows how the dispersion of                 
              players' beliefs interacts with learning, using its implications               
              for the probability distribution of the limiting outcome (normally             
              one of the equilibria of the underlying coordination game) to                  
              explain the observed patterns of discrimination.  The ultimate goal            
              is to understand more generally how the number of players, the ways            
              in which they interact, how their payoffs are determined, and their            
              opportunities to communicate influence coordination outcomes.
