Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will aid in purchasing a high resolution mass spectrometer for                 
              the Department of Chemistry at New York University.  The                       
              research studies to be performed include the following:                        
              molecular recognition in solutions and solids, solid state                     
              host-organic zeolites, self assembling hosts, tunneling in                     
              biological electron transfer reactions, new methods for                        
              conformational restriction, synthetic peptide models for                       
              investigating the determinants of alpha helical structure,                     
              organic photochemistry, synthesis of new neuroreceptor ligands,                
              and topics in organic synthesis.                                               
                                                                                             
              Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate                   
              structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of                 
              a vast array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic                         
              molecules.  The addition of the technique of electrospray                      
              extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic acid molecular                  
              weights far beyond any other technique.  The use of                            
              electrospray ionization in combination with high resolution                    
              provides the latest techniques available in mass spectrometry.                 
              It affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available                
              for the characterization of compounds.  The acquisition of this                
              capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the                           
              prosecution of frontier research in many fields of chemistry.
