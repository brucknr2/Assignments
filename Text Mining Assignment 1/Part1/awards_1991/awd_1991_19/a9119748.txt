Abstract    :
                   This grant in theoretical physics supports the research                   
              of Professors O.W. Greenberg and J.C. Pati at the University                   
              of Maryland.  The work will address foundational issues in                     
              field theory (Greenberg) concerning the possible violation of                  
              Fermi-Bose statistics and the problem of color confinement and                 
              the important physical issue of the possible substructure of                   
              quarks and leptons (Pati).
