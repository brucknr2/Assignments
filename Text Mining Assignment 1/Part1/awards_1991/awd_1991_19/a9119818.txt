Abstract    :
                   Professor Rudd will continue his research into the dynamics               
              of ionizing heavy particle collisions.  He has designed and now                
              has under construction a unique apparatus that will permit                     
              measurement of the energy and angular distribution of electrons                
              emitted by impact of moderately high-energy protons on hydrogen                
              atoms in a crossed beam configuration.  These studies will decide              
              which of several competing theoretical models is the correct one               
              describing this most elementary of heavy particle collisions.
