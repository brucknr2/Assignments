Abstract    :
              The research will extend the time                                              
              scale concepts to cover long range                                             
              dynamics, develop new numerical                                                
              techniques such as multi-rate                                                  
              integration technique and also                                                 
              investigate new numerical algorithms                                           
              for parallel processing.  The                                                  
              conjugate gradient approach which is                                           
              widely used in solving linear                                                  
              equations in other engineering                                                 
              systems on a parallel mode will be                                             
              intensely investigated to achieve                                              
              high speed simulation of transients                                            
              in power systems.  In addition a                                               
              theoretically sound and complete                                               
              study of voltage collapse study will                                           
              be done based on a new form of                                                 
              linearized analysis.  Just as in the                                           
              case of previous proposals where we                                            
              provided an update on the "Energy                                              
              Function Analysis In Power Systems"                                            
              through a research monograph, we                                               
              plan to write a research monograph                                             
              on at least one of the following                                               
              topics (i) small signal analysis or                                            
              (ii) voltage stability.  We consider                                           
              this as one essential element in                                               
              development of education and human
