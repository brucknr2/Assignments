Abstract    :
                   The docking of India onto the Asian continent has resulted in             
              tremendous uplift throughout much of the Cenozoic.  Erosion of the             
              uplifted mountain ranges and deposition in tectonically depressed              
              basins has also resulted in one of the thickest and the most                   
              complete records of late Cenozoic.  Sediments spanning the last ~              
              20 Ma are well exposed in the Siwalik and Rawalpindi Group rocks               
              of the Potwar Plateau of northern Pakistan.  The earlier                       
              continental record is preserved to the South in the Sulaiman                   
              foreland basin, located in central Pakistan.  However, the Sulaiman            
              sequence lies almost completely within Tribal Territory and cannot             
              be accessed by foreigners (including the non-tribal Pakistani).                
              Fortunately, there is one corner of the SUlaiman foreland basin                
              that is accessible to non-native persons, the Zinda Pir Dome.  We              
              have targeted this area for a combined magneto-biostratigraphic                
              study in order to extend the vertebrate fossil record into deposits            
              older that the 18.3 Ma limit found in the Potwar Plateau.  This                
              project was initiated by Dr. E.H. Lindsay of the University of                 
              Arizona in 1987.  Lindsay and co-workers have completed three field            
              seasons (1988, 1989 and 1990).  During the last of these a number              
              of paleomagnetic samples were taken.  However, skepticism in the               
              community exists about the potential for success of the                        
              paleomagnetic investigations.  Since paleomagnetic data are                    
              essential to provide a chronostratigraphic framework, we are                   
              requesting limited support to analyze existing samples in order to             
              assess their reliability as paleomagnetic recorders.  As this study            
              necessarily carries some risk of failure, we are seeking funds                 
              specifically designated for "small-scale, exploratory, high-risk"              
              research.
