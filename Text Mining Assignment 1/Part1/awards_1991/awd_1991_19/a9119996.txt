Abstract    :
              This is a proposal a 300 MHz solid state NMR spectrometer that will            
              be used for research which addresses important topics in the fields            
              of biomolecular structure and surface and polymer chemistry.  The              
              biophysical projects will investigate the structure and mechanism              
              of membrane proteins, with the aim of understanding the role of                
              conformational changes in signal transduction and the role of                  
              membrane inserton in the gating of channels.  The instrument will              
              also enable high field studies which will compoement an existing               
              zero field NMR program to investigate the chemistry of catalytic               
              surfaces.  Finally, this instrument will enhance a strong program              
              in polymer science, with projects ranging from the investigation of            
              structure and dynamics in polymers with powerful new two                       
              dimensional solid state NMR techniques ot the characterization of              
              an exciting new class of materials, biopolymers.  This is an ideal             
              environment for expanding the application of solid state NMR to                
              answer biological questions, because of the confluence of several              
              soid state NMR spectroscopists and numerous investigators in the               
              bioligical science who already participate in an interdisciplinary             
              graduate program in molecular and cellular biology.
