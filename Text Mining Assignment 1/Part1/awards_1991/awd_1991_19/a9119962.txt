Abstract    :
              Congestion as occurs in waiting lines or queues (as found in                   
              telecommunications, retailing, ATM's, etc) is the focus of this                
              research proposal.  The proposal builds on a new statistical                   
              inference method -- "Queue Inference Engine (QIE)" -- that computes            
              statistically unbiased estimates of virtually all relevant queue               
              performance measures from the transactional data alone, with no                
              queue observation or parameter estimation required.  The project               
              builds on earlier work in four ways (1) to derive various bounds               
              and approximations that speed computation and facilitate analysis              
              of very congested systems; (2) to create new queue inference                   
              algorithms in more complex settings; (3) to derive the equivalent              
              of statistical confidence limits on the QIE results, so that one               
              can know a priori required sample sizes; and (4) to attempt to                 
              create a server allocation or scheduling algorithm within the QIE              
              framework, that would be data intensive, essentially parameter free            
              and would reflect accurately transient operations.
