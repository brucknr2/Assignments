Abstract    :
              The basic kinetics of reactions which involve the formation and                
              subsequent reactivity of unstable chemical species such as                     
              multiradicals and zwitterions will be probed. The concurrent                   
              use of ESR, NMR, and optical transient spectroscopy will                       
              provide basic mechanistic information which will aid in                        
              designing chemical reactions involving highly reactive                         
              intermediates from a rational viewpoint. The research topics to                
              be investigated include: (1) the trapping of oxyallyls via                     
              dimethylfulvene and related agents; (2) production of                          
              disjointed biradicals; (3) confirmation of the spin                            
              multiplicity and reactivity of tetramethylene benzene; (4)                     
              adjustment of the multiplet gap of biradicals based upon                       
              disjointed tetramethyleneethanes; (5) synthesis of polyradicals                
              based upon coupling of two dimethyleneheterocycles via a                       
              benzene ring; and (6) synthesis and characterization of stable                 
              biradicals. These chemical systems will serve as models for                    
              materials with optical, conducting, and magnetic properties of                 
              practical importance.

              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Jerome A. Berson at Yale                          
              University. Professor Berson and his research group will probe                 
              very reactive species, called diradicals, which are formed in                  
              the intermediate stages of chemical processes and often live                   
              for only a few billionths of a second. Information about these                 
              intermediates may make it possible design totally new molecules                
              with important chemical and technical properties. The concepts                 
              to be derived from this work are critical to the understanding                 
              of how molecules conduct electricity and interact with light,                  
              and will also aid in the design of chemical systems which can                  
              be used to make optical fibers to transmit information in the                  
              form of light pulses faster and more efficiently over long                     
              distances.
