Abstract    :
                   The processes by which animals, plants, and other life forms              
              adapt to patterns of environmental stress and variability will be              
              studied in the context of how individuals acquire and use energy.              
              An insect model system will be used; much progress has already                 
              been made in understanding this system, and general ideas derived              
              from it have been shown to apply to life forms as diverse as                   
              bacteria, crustaceans, fish, and mammals.  Natural genetic                     
              variation in the mechanisms of energy processing and allocation                
              will be studied in the context of how these mechanisms are                     
              impacted by patterns of environmental change.  The results will                
              have importance not only for fundamental understanding of how                  
              living beings adapt to their environments, but potentially also                
              for understanding how domestic animals, crop plants, or managed                
              forest trees do so in the specific context of human                            
              agricultural/economic management and global climate change.
