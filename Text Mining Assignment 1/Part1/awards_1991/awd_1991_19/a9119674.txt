Abstract    :
                   The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the                   
              roles played by plant chemistry in the ecology and evolution of a              
              single taxon of herbivorous insects, namely the butterfly family               
              Papilionidae.                                                                  
                   Emphasis during the next three years will continue to be                  
              placed on the chemical basis of plant recognition by oviposition               
              males.  The occurrence of contact and volatile oviposition                     
              stimulants for the black swallowtail, Papilio polyxenes (tribe                 
              Papilionini), will be surveyed in a variety of host and non-host               
              plants to assess the specificity and variability of chemical                   
              response profiles in one insect species.  Identification of                    
              oviposition stimulants from Asimina spp. for Eurytides marcellus               
              (tribe Graphiini) will be completed for comparison with known                  
              stimulants for Battus philenor (tribe Troidini) and P. polyxenes               
              (tribe Papilionini).  Identification of stimulants and deterrents              
              will also be carried out with P. machaon, which shows evidence of              
              a host switch from the Apiacea to the Asteraceae (genus                        
              Artemisia)                                                                     
                   These comparative studies will permit testing of a long-held              
              hypothesis that the evolutionary radiation of swallowtail                      
              butterflies has been constrained by the botanical distribution of              
              particular chemical compounds that are used as behavioral cues in              
              host recognition.
