Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              For streams on the North Shore of Lake Superior, salmon are a                  
              recently introduced exotic species, and may be altering the                    
              stream ecosystems from their historic state.  Are salmon                       
              migrations into streams a significant source of nutrients and                  
              high quality organic matter for these stream ecosystems?  The                  
              importance of migration salmon in nutrient and organic matter                  
              flow through stream ecosystem components will be tested using                  
              experimental, comparative, and stable isotope tracer techniques.               
              It is hypothesized that the presence of salmon will: 1) result in              
              a shift away from terrestrial sources of organic matter and                    
              inorganic nutrients toward lake derived sources (salmon carcasses              
              and spawn); and 2) will alter the seasonal patterns of nutrient                
              limitation.  This shift will be reflected in changes in                        
              periphyton, fine particle and dissolved organic carbon, grazer,                
              shredder, and collector components of the ecosystem which can be               
              traced using stable isotopes.  It is further hypothesized that,                
              3) the size of a patch of salmon carcasses determines the spatial              
              scale of the effect on the resource within the ecosystem.  A                   
              combination of experimental and comparative studies will provide               
              insight into the interdependence of nutrient limitation and                    
              nutrient and organic matter flow through these stream ecosystems.
