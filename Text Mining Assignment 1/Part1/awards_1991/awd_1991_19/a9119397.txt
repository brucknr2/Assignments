Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Stromelysins are a family of secreted metalloproteinases that                  
              degrade various components of the extracellular matrix.  Recent                
              evidence suggests that the secretion of stromelysins from nerve                
              cells may play a role in axonal growth.  To address this issue, the            
              neuronal-like clonal cell line, PC12, will be used in a novel in               
              vitro assay to study the effect of experimentally manipulated                  
              stromelysin levels on neurite invasiveness of basal lamina. The                
              possible release of stromelysin from PC12 growth cones will also be            
              studied using immunocytochemistry and in situ substrate                        
              degradation.  In addition, possible tissue-specific and                        
              developmental stage-specific expression of stromelysin mRNA will be            
              studied in the embryonic rat.  These studies promise to enhance our            
              understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in the growth of                
              axons.
