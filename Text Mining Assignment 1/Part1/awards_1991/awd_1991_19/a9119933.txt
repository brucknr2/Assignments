Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of separation science.  During the               
              tenure of this three-year continuing RUI grant, Professor Pesek                
              and his students will pursue the development of chemical                       
              modification procedures for alteration of porous silica stationary             
              phases for high performance liquid chromatography and glass                    
              capillary walls for high performance capillary electrophoresis.                
              The synthetic approach involves converting surface silanol                     
              functionalities to hydrides which can be further reacted by                    
              hydrosilation reactions to produce bonded organic moieties.  These             
              bonded materials have a direct carbon-silicon bond to the surface              
              instead of the more common siloxane linkage which arises from                  
              standard organosilane reactions procedures.  The direct linkage                
              has been proven both chromatographically and electrophoretically               
              to be more stable than the siloxane linkages to a much wider range             
              of analytical solution environments.  Additionally, bonded liquid              
              crystal stationary phases will be further developed and                        
              characterized spectroscopically, thermally, and                                
              chromatographically.                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              This research builds upon results obtained under Dr. Pesek's                   
              previous NSF grant, CHE-8814849, and will enable a clearer                     
              definition of the mobile phase/stationary phase interface.                     
              Additionally, this research should provide insightful guidance for             
              the more rational and efficient design and synthesis of liquid                 
              crystal chromatographic stationary phases.
