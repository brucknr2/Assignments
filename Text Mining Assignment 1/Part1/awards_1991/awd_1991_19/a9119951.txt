Abstract    :
                   The storing and sharing of energy between the two electrons               
              in alkaline earth atoms is examined using multi-laser/multi-                   
              photon techniques.  Short pulse laser technology makes it                      
              possible to study the detailed motion of the two electrons in a                
              time less than the period of a single electron.  These                         
              measurements complement the more usual spectroscopic techniques,               
              providing new insights and tests of theoretical models.
