Abstract    :
              Thick layers of high mobility electron gas are produced by                     
              remotely-doped GaAs/AlGaAs semiconductor heterostructures in which             
              the aluminum (Al) concentration is graded in a parabolic profile.              
              The electron mobility in the resulting structures can be quite                 
              high, because donor ions are located outside the wall.  More                   
              complex electron profiles can be made using potentials other than              
              simple parabolas.  Such work will be carried out in this project,              
              in which both the charge and spin density profiles will be                     
              spatially modulated.  This will be accomplished in thick layers of             
              high-mobility electron gas by using superlattices superimposed on              
              parabolic wells, and by using periodic electric and magnetic gate              
              structures fabricated with electron-beam lithography.  The                     
              resulting structures and materials have very interesting electron-             
              magnetic properties, of current interest from the fundamental solid            
              state physics perspective, and of future interest for use as                   
              advanced semiconductor device materials.
