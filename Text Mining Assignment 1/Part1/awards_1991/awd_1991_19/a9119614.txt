Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The spatial patterns and properties of beaver ponds change                     
              abruptly during population expansion, and there are scale-                     
              dependent pathways of pond establishment and abandonment.  Thus,               
              ecosystem properties of beaver ponds are not randomly distributed              
              across the landscape nor do they change randomly through time.                 
              This research project suggests the following hypothesis:                       
                                                                                             
              Ecosystem dynamics in valleys occupied by beaver are determined                
              by 1) the geomorphology, hydrologic regimes, and carbon and                    
              nutrient pools antecedent to pond establishment,  2) changes in                
              food supply in uplands as beaver forage, and 3) changes in the                 
              hydrologic regimes and nutrient cycles during pond creation and                
              abandonment.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The relative importance of each of theses factors changes during               
              beaver population cycles, resulting in multiple successional                   
              pathways and multiple stable states across the landscape.                      
                                                                                             
              This project will test this hypothesis at landscape and ecosystem              
              scales by: 1) analyses of spatial patterns of ponds and adjacent               
              riparian forests using a 65 year sequence of air photos,                       
              geographic information systems, geostatistics, and percolation                 
              theory: 2) manipulating nutrient availabilities in mixed species               
              communities in the field and manipulating nutrients, water, and                
              litter in monoculture mesocosms; and 3) constructing a scale-                  
              dependent model of the dynamics of boreal landscapes influenced                
              by beaver.
