Abstract    :
                Kim Katrina Burson has been awarded a Minority Graduate                      
              Assistantship in Chemistry. The Minority Graduate                              
              Assistantships in Chemistry are viewed as an infrastructural                   
              investment designed to broaden the participation, knowledge,                   
              and experience of students who are members of minority groups                  
              underrepresented in Chemistry, and attract them into meaningful                
              careers in chemical research and teaching.

              Ms. Burson's baccalaureate degree is from San Jose State                       
              University.  She graduated with  a GPA of 3.90/4.0 and is                      
              considered to be one of the top 2 or 3 students they have had                  
              in the past 5 years.  She has been accepted in the Ph.D.                       
              program at Stanford University where she intends to specialize                 
              in Physical Organic Chemistry.
