Abstract    :
                   This action will provide support for three faculty                        
              members, research associates and students to continue research                 
              in elementary particle physics.  A new activity will be                        
              started at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring to study                          
              reactions initiated through the interaction of two photons                     
              with each other.  This is a continuation of the line of                        
              research the group has been performing at the Stanford Linear                  
              Accelerator Center.  Research and development of energy                        
              measurement calorimeters for possible application in a                         
              particle detector at the Superconducting Supercollider, is                     
              underway.  The group will also develop a detector to search                    
              for non luminous matter remaining from an early epoch of the                   
              universe the so called weakly interacting massive particles.
