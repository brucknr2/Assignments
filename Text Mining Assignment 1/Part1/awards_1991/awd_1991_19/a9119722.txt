Abstract    :
              Despite the recent advances in the area of adaptive                            
              control, most of today's adaptive control schemes                              
              often exhibit poor transient and steady-state                                  
              performance.  Phenomena such as bursting, chaos                                
              and large transient oscillations are often observed                            
              in simulations of stable adaptive schemes.  The                                
              proposed research aims to eliminate these                                      
              undesirable phenomena by studying new design                                   
              approaches and introducing the appropriate                                     
              mathematical tools that can be used to quantify and                            
              analyze transient and steady state performance in                              
              addition to stability and robustness.  The design                              
              approaches proposed are based on the                                           
              augmentation of the  certainty equivalence control                             
              laws that are used in almost every adaptive control                            
              scheme, by using performance considerations in                                 
              addition to stability and robustness.  Such                                    
              augmentation  includes discontinuous control laws                              
              as well as smooth ones.  The research goal is to                               
              develop a procedure for designing and analyzing                                
              adaptive control schemes that can meet                                         
              prespecified performance and robustness                                        
              requirements.
