Abstract    :
                   This action provides partial support for the Seventh                      
              International Workshop on Fission-Track Thermochronology to be held            
              during the week of July 13-17, 1992 at the University of                       
              Pennsylvania.  This field has experienced rapid development since              
              the last workshop on this subject four years ago and the outcome               
              should be of considerable benefit to Fission-Track geochronologists            
              in their efforts to date tectonic events by this method.
