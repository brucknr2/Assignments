Abstract    :
                   This grant will support continued operation of the Fly's                  
              Eye (FE I and FE II) detectors by the University of Utah.  The                 
              research addressed concerns the fundamental questions                          
              surrounding the very highest energy cosmic rays which enter                    
              Earth's atmosphere from space.  The nature, source and energy                  
              of these rays are examined by FE I and FE II situated at                       
              Dugway, Utah approximately 90 miles from Salt Lake City, by                    
              measuring the minute amounts of light emitted by nitrogen in                   
              the air as cosmic ray fragments pass through.                                  
                   Nitrogen fluorescence produced in cosmic ray showers is                   
              focussed by two arrays of mirrors (FE I and FE II,                             
              respectively) onto photomultiplier tubes.  Data are recorded                   
              electronically, and shower track directions are reconstructed                  
              from position and timing information by off line computer                      
              analysis.  Shower shape, direction and size are used to                        
              determine the nature, origin and energy of the primary cosmic                  
              radiation.
