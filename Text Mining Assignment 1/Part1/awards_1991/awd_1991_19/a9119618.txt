Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Invasions by introduced grasses are a common phenomenon                        
              worldwide, with the potential for dramatic community and                       
              ecosystem-level effects.  This study will investigate changes in               
              ecosystem properties induced by alien grass invasion in a                      
              nitrogen-limited, seasonally dry woodland in Hawai'i and a natural             
              savanna lands in Venezuela.  Hawaiian ecosystems are ideal for such            
              tests because of the relative simplicity of the communities and the            
              ease with which invasions can be documented.  Two grass species                
              have a distinct pattern of invasion into theses woodlands:                     
              Schizachyrium condensatum invades undisturbed woodland and promotes            
              fire.  After fire, Melinis minutiflora largely replaces both                   
              Schizachyrium and native woodland species resulting in a low                   
              diversity, more readily burned grassland.  Nutrient availability               
              changes predictably with fire, yielding, a clear pattern of                    
              vegetation change that likely coincides with a predictable change              
              in soil nutrients.  The researchers propose to investigate the                 
              processes driving vegetation and soil nutrient changes and to                  
              examine the influence of fire and the post-fire presence of alien              
              grasses on nutrient limitation.  Specifically, they will test the              
              hypothesis that grass invasion induces largescale changes in                   
              nutrient cycling and that these changes feedback to influence                  
              population-level processes involving both native and introduced                
              species.  The Venezuela study will permit tests of the generality              
              of any conclusions.
