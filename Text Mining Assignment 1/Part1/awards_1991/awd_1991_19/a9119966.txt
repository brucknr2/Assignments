Abstract    :
              This research will concentrate on radical-based organoantimony                 
              chemistry, relying on the coordination of metal centered                       
              radicals by an adjacent hetero atom prior to intramolecular                    
              iodine atom transfer from carbon to antimony.  Tetraphenyl                     
              distibine, diphenylstibine and allyl(diphenyl)stibine will be                  
              examined as selective reagents for the conversion of alkyl                     
              halides, chalcogenides and other precursors into alkylstibines,                
              alcohols, compounds bearing allylic substituents, nitroalkenes                 
              and ethers.  The methods will be extended to other antimony                    
              reagents, to other Group V elements and to tin(IV) compounds                   
              bearing electron withdrawing ligands.  These studies will                      
              clarify the mechanism of radical selectivity and provide a new                 
              strategy for synthetic chemistry that will be applied to the                   
              concise synthesis of several natural products.

              With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Anthony G.M. Barrett of the                     
              Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University.  Dr.                     
              Barrett will focus his work on the development of selective                    
              synthetic methodology based upon metal centered radicals                       
              generated from antimony compounds.
