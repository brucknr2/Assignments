Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The experiments of this proposal use three-dimensional recordings              
              of electrical potentials produced by brain cells in response to                
              sound stimulation (auditory evoked potentials or AEPs) to explore              
              how the rat's brain processes auditory information.  These                     
              experiments will provide a basis for understanding the                         
              relationship between the function of auditory cortex as measured               
              in the AEP and underlying anatomy in the rodent, bridging the gap              
              in out understanding between single cell properties in auditory                
              cortex and the response properties of larger systems of nerve                  
              cells.  This work will also serve to verify and improve                        
              physiological and mathematical models used to interpret the AEP,               
              advancing the use of evoked potential measurement as an invasive               
              and noninvasive tool for investigating brain function in animals               
              and in man.//
