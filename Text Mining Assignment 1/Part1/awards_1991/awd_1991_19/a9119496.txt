Abstract    :
              The chemistry of N-aminoaziridines as chiral auxiliaries in                    
              hydrazone alkylations and other reactions will be thoroughly                   
              explored.  The chemistry should allow the preparation of                       
              1,3-skipped polymethylated carbon chains in a highly convergent                
              and enantioselective manner.  Extensions to Shapiro-type                       
              elimination reactions promise to result in efficient new                       
              methods of chiral alkene construction.  The methodology will be                
              applied to the synthesis of the macrolactone antibiotic                        
              venturicin.

              With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                
              research of Dr. A. Richard Chamberlin at the Unversity of                      
              California-Irvine. The research explores the development of                    
              chiral methodologies for synthesis of the important polyol and                 
              polypropionate structures found in important antibiotic                        
              families.  This should benefit research in biochemistry and                    
              medicine, as well as in the chemical industry.
