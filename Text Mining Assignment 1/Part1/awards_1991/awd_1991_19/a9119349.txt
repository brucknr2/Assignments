Abstract    :
                   The overall objective of the proposed work is to improve our              
              understanding of the evolution of a family of "jumping genes"                  
              called "P elements" in Drosophila fruit flies, with particular                 
              emphasis on the mode and frequency of mating-independent,                      
              horizontal transfer of these elements between evolutionary                     
              lineages of the flies.  One major focus is to investigate whether              
              a species of parasitic mites can act as a vector for                           
              interspecific transfer of P element genetic material.  A second                
              major focus is the comparison of P elements from a representative              
              sample of Drosophila species, in order to study the frequency and              
              pattern of P element transfer during the evolution of this family              
              of flies.                                                                      
                   The methods to be employed rely heavily on modern molecular               
              genetic techniques.  Mixed species population cages will be used               
              for the study of interspecies transfer.  The proposed work has                 
              potential significance for better understanding the origin and                 
              evolution of jumping genes and the evolutionary significance of                
              horizontal transfer.  It may also provide fascinating new                      
              insights into molecular coevolutionary relationships between                   
              parasites and their hosts.
