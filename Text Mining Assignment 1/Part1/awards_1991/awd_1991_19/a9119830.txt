Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface                 
              Chemistry Program, uses Raman spectroscopy to monitor                          
              electrochemical intercalation and lattice damage on ordered                    
              graphite and glassy carbon electrodes.  Instrumentation                        
              development to enable the detection of monolayer adsorbates on                 
              the carbon surfaces is also planned.  The overall objective of                 
              the research is to determine the connection between electrode                  
              structure and reactivity, to enable the rational design of                     
              improved carbon electrodes for electrocatalysis and detector                   
              applications.                                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Raman spectroscopy will be used in this research project to                    
              study the structure of intercalated carbon electrodes, and to                  
              obtain information about the nature and structure of adsorbates                
              on the surface of these electrode materials.  This information                 
              will be useful for the design of better electrocatalytic                       
              materials, and possible carbon electrode based gas detectors.
