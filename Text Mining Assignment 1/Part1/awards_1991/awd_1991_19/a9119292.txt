Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term goal of this research is to understand the structure             
              and  catalytic mechanism of cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP).  CCP is             
              a 34,000 M.W. monomeric heme protein that catalyses the reductive              
              cleavage of peroxide to water, using ferrous cytochrome c as the               
              electron donor.  The crystal structures of CCP, its two-electron               
              oxidation product, Compound I (formed by the reaction of the enzyme            
              with peroxide), enzyme:inhibitor complexes, and several mutant CCPs            
              have been solved.  The available structural information makes CCP              
              an attractive system for the study of intermolecular electron                  
              transfer and O-O bond activation by heme proteins.  The proposed               
              investigation will employ site-directed mutagenesis to perturb the             
              enzyme structure and X-ray crystallography to describe the                     
              resulting structural changes.  Subsequent characterization of these            
              mutants by spectroscopic and kinetic techniques will be used to                
              relate the changes in structure to changes in the primary reactions            
              of the enzyme.  The results of the proposed research will provide              
              insight into the structural features that are involved in                      
              electrostatic recognition between macromolecule and rapid transfer             
              of electrons between heme proteins.  The proposed work will also               
              provide insight into the mechanisms that proteins use to modify the            
              reactivity of the heme prosthetic group to accomplish a                        
              characteristic reaction.
