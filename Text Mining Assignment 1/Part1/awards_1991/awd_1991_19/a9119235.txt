Abstract    :
                   Although stems are the second most important photosynthetic               
              organ, very little is known about stem photosynthesis.  Little is              
              known about adaptation or acclimation of stem photosynthesis to                
              different climatic conditions.  Studies of comparative leaf                    
              photosynthesis on plants from different climates have been                     
              pivotal to understanding the mechanisms by which plants survive                
              in a diversity of habitats.  Similar studies on stem                           
              photosynthesis, particularly in mediterranean and desert taxa,                 
              are required to understand the significance of stem                            
              photosynthesis.  The objective of this proposal is to measure                  
              stem photosynthesis for mediterranean and desert taxa during the               
              winter and summer.  Comparisons of these results will test for                 
              stem photosynthetic adaptation to these different habitats.                    
              Furthermore, a mathematical model of canopy stem photosynthesis                
              will be developed.  The model will be able to predict the                      
              importance of stem photosynthesis to a diversity of species in a               
              series of different habitats.                                                  
                   This research will greatly expand our knowledge about the                 
              significance of stem photosynthesis to plants.  This information               
              can be applied to analyses of plant success in various                         
              environments.  Furthermore, the data collected in this study are               
              crucial for understanding the importance of stem photosynthesis                
              to growth of legume crops in agroecosystems.
