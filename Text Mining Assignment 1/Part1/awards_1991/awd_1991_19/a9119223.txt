Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this US-Poland research project between                       
              Dr. Robert T. Siegel of the College of William & Mary and                      
              Dr. A. Adamczyk of the Institute of Nuclear Physics,                           
              Cracow, Poland is to calculate a complete set of those                         
              muonic differential cross-sections which are relevant to                       
              muon catalyzed fusion and weak interaction physics.  The                       
              planned calculations are based on the development of                           
              numerical methods for estimation of the molecular binding,                     
              spin correlations, and electron screening effects in the                       
              scattering of muonic hydrogen atoms on hydrogen molecules.                     
              The numerical methods for these calculations were                              
              developed over many years in Poland.  As a result of the                       
              project, the researchers plan to complete an altas of the                      
              up, ud and ut mesic atom scattering cross sections on the                      
              ground and excited states of all the molecular targets of                      
              hydrogen isotopes H2, D2, and T2.  These results will                          
              provide the final information necessary to the detailed                        
              analysis of already performed and planned experiments by                       
              an experimental collaboration between William & Mary, PSI                      
              (Switzerland), IMEP (Austria) and Munich (Germany).                            
                                                                                             
              This project in physics fulfills the program objective of                      
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts                     
              in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                             
              complementary talents and pool resources in areas of                           
              strong mutual interest and competence.
