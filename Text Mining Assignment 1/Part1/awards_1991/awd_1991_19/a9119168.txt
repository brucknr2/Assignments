Abstract    :
                 This project is aimed toward the examination, composition and               
              function of the flagellar transition region of Chlamydomonas                   
              reinhardtii.  The combined genetic, molecular, and ultrastructural             
              approach will focus on the presence of the calcium-binding protein             
              centrin, which is thought to be in the stellate fibers of the                  
              transition region.  Several centrin mutants have been                          
              characterized, including one where glu 101 has been converted to               
              lys in one of the E-F-hands (a calcium binding site on the protein.            
              Chlamydomonas mutants should also permit the enrichment of                     
              flagellar transition regions, where the phenotypic expression of               
              supernumarary transition regions increases the likelihood of                   
              biochemical purification protocols.  It is unlikely that the                   
              transition region can be studied in this fashion with any other                
              organism.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
                 All eukaryotic cilia and flagella possess a highly specialized              
              transition region in the section of the axoneme that is immediately            
              adjacent with the cell body.  The transition region is not well                
              understood functionally, though it has been characterized                      
              ultrastructurally in a number of organisms.  In the unicellular                
              alga Chlamydomonas reinhartii, the flagellar transition region can             
              be studied by a combination of methods that include genetic                    
              manipulation, biochemical isolation and ultrastructural                        
              observation.  This project combines these approaches in a novel way            
              that should contribute important compositional and functional                  
              information about the flagellar transition region, not only in C.              
              reinhardtii, but in other flagellated cells, as well.
