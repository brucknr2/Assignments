Abstract    :
              It is proposed the "continuous particle ablation                               
              process" with the following goals:  (1) Ultrafine                              
              particles to be produced with exceptional purity (fiber                        
              optics grade); (2) Both single component and                                   
              stoichiometrically correct compound particles,                                 
              including coated or capped particles, can be                                   
              produced; (3) Particle shape should be spherical and                           
              agglomerates are not acceptable; (4) The process                               
              should be amenable (both technically and                                       
              economically) to scale up to kg/h production rates.                            
              Essentially, micrometer or supermicrometer aerosol                             
              particles, produced upstream by conventional                                   
              methods of aerosol technology are continuously flow                            
              in a carrier gas in a supersonic jet through the focus                         
              of a pulsed laser beam, where they are continuously                            
              ablated/vaporized to vapor and seed clusters.  These                           
              seed clusters can grow subsequently by condensation                            
              to produce nearly monodisperse nanometer clusters.                             
              Downstream, the clusters can be processed and                                  
              modified chemically, if desired, and used in any                               
              specific application.  The ablation and growth                                 
              processes in the supersonic jet will be modeled                                
              numerically to obtain a fundamental understanding of                           
              this complex process and as an aid in subsequent                               
              scale up of the process.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The proposed process will provide a significant                                
              advancement in production of ultrafine, ultrapure                              
              particles at high rates.
