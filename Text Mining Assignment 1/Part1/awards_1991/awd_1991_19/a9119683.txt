Abstract    :
              Marine geological and geophysical studies of the Ross Sea and                  
              Weddell Sea continental shelves provide evidence that the ice sheet            
              grounded near the shelf edge in these areas during the late                    
              Wisconsinan, and that the retreat of the ice sheet to its present              
              position was rapid and probably episodic.  This Award supports a               
              project which will establish the most recent (late Wisconsin-                  
              Holocene) history of ice sheet advance and retreat in Ross Sea.                
              The objectives include: 1) reconstruction the late Wisconsin                   
              paleodrainage regime, including ice stream divides; 2)                         
              reconstruction of former grounding zone positions; 3) constraint               
              of the timing of ice sheet retreat from the shelf; and 4)                      
              acquisition of geophysical, sedimentological, and paleontological              
              data which may provide indicators the environmental factors that               
              may have influenced to ice sheet retreat.  This is a joint effort              
              between Rice University, the University of Colorado, and Hamilton              
              College.  The project involves experts in a wide variety of fields,            
              and will interface with glaciologists, physical oceanographers and             
              climatologists who will address the problem of ice sheet stability             
              and the record of climatic and glaciological change.
