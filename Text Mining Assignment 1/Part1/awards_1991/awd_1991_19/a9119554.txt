Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is common to think of using the brightest stars to determine                
              extragalactic distances.  Over 50 years ago Hubble first attempted             
              to resolve stars in other galaxies to quantify the expansion of the            
              universe, and since then, the use of blue and red supergiants for              
              extragalactic distance determinations has been explored several                
              times.  However, only recently has it been appreciated that young              
              planetary nebulae also fall into the "brightest stars" category and            
              are therefore potentially useful as distance indicators.  The                  
              central stars of these objects are almost as luminous as bright red            
              supergiants, and, as a result, present telescopes and current                  
              technology allow planetary nebulae to be detected at distances as              
              large as 25 megaparsecs.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Planetary nebulae have several advantages over most other                      
              extragalactic distance indicators.  Because they are not associated            
              with any one stellar population they can be found in all types of              
              galaxies, and are particularly valuable for probing elliptical                 
              galaxies.  It is elliptical galaxies which define the cores of                 
              large groups and clusters.                                                     
                                                                                             
              In this grant surveys of planetary in elliptical galaxies will be              
              made out to a distance of 25 megaparsecs.  These measurements will             
              add to our understanding of the large scale motions of galaxies and            
              in other studies.
