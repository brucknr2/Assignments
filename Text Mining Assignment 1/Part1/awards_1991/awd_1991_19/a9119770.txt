Abstract    :
                   This study will examine the hydrology and geochemistry of pore            
              fluids from Holocene Islands in Florida Bay over a two year                    
              periods.  In particular we intend to test the following hypotheses:            
              1) Fluid movement is taking place beneath supratidal carbonate mud             
              islands in Florida Bay in response to the reflux of hypersaline                
              fluids formed on the island surfaces; 2) Dolomite is forming in                
              response to the movement of these fluids and therefore                         
              dolomitization is more extensive in islands which have been islands            
              throughout their entire history than in islands which have formed              
              more recently; 3) The difference in fluid density amongst the                  
              various islands is a result of a climatic gradient, the highest                
              salinities occurring in the areas of the bay with the lowest                   
              rainfall.  The magnitude of the reflux is greater in those islands             
              which show a greater difference in fluid density between the island            
              and the adjacent bay.                                                          
                   In order to test these hypotheses, we will (i) core between               
              10 to 20 islands which span the climatic gradient present in                   
              Florida Bay and which on the basis of previously published work                
              have experienced sedimentological different histories, (ii)                    
              instrument two islands which occur at the ends of this climatic                
              gradient with a series of nested piezometers and carry out                     
              geochemical analyses at regular intervals throughout the wet and               
              dry seasons.
