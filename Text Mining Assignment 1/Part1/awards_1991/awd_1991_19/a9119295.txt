Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary                                     
              research project between Drs. Istvan Bogardi                                   
              of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and                                     
              Lucien Duckstein of the University of                                          
              Arizona-Tucson, with Dr. Ferenc Rakoczi of                                     
              the Department of Meteorology, Eotvos                                          
              University, Budapest, Hungary, is to develop                                   
              methods to predict local hydrological                                          
              variables influenced by climate fluctuations                                   
              by defining a probabilistic linkage between                                    
              the occurrence and type of atmospheric                                         
              circulation patterns and (a) local                                             
              precipitation, (b) flood events, (c) dry                                       
              periods, and (d) lake levels.  With that                                       
              linkage, they will use available general                                       
              circulation model scenarios to predict the                                     
              hydrological quantities reflecting climate                                     
              change.  They will use and compare these                                       
              concepts to two drainage basins, in Hungary                                    
              and the U.S., and study lake level                                             
              fluctuations at Lake Balaton in Hungary and                                    
              the Great Salt Lake in Utah.  The results                                      
              should constitute a major input into water                                     
              resources decision-making, including the                                       
              mitigation of the effects of climate                                           
              fluctuation and global change on local                                         
              hydrology.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project in civil engineering fulfills                                     
              the program objectives of advancing                                            
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading                                       
              experts in the United States and Eastern                                       
              Europe to combine complimentary talents and                                    
              pool research resources in areas of strong                                     
              mutual interest and competence.
