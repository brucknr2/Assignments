Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is concerned with the synthesis and characterization             
              of novel crystalline and polymeric, conductive and magnetic                    
              materials that are based on metal-organic complexes.  The question             
              of quantum effects on electrical conductivity in molecular metals              
              that are quasi 1-D, yet remain highly conductive as temperature                
              goes to zero, is addressed.  New alloys will be prepared to study              
              the Kondo effect in 1-dimension, and to examine low-temperature                
              condensation that arises from indirect carrier-mediated coupling               
              between the localized moments.  Mechanism of spin coupling and                 
              characterization of magnetic ordering in new materials also are                
              explored.  Further, new porphyrazine-thiolates are prepared that               
              are eventually suitable for the development of multimetal molecular            
              complexes and ribbon and sheet polymer for use as conductors and               
              magnets.
