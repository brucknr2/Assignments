Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds continuation of the outstanding work on the search            
              for anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background of the group               
              at the Owens Valley radio Observatory.  This group has done some               
              of the most sensitive attempts to measure such anisotropies, which             
              must exist, according to current theories of galaxy formation.  So             
              far, no such anisotropy has been unambiguously measured, and the               
              extension of these attempts to lower levels places strong                      
              constraints on our models of the early universe.
