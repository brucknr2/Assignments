Abstract    :
                   Parasites may have subtle effects in the distributions of                 
              their hosts, including altering thermal preferences.  The                      
              immature stage of a heat-sensitive acanthocephalan thorny-headed               
                                                                                             
              worm inhabits several cockroach hosts before reaching maturity in              
                                                                                             
              the rat when eaten.  Insects such as the cockroaches can induce                
              fever behaviorally by choosing warm microhabitats.  The study                  
              will assess whether infected and uninfected cockroaches respond                
              differently to a temperature gradient, how cockroach temperature               
                                                                                             
              choice affects parasite level and whether temperature influences               
                                                                                             
              the effects of infection on cockroach reproduction and longevity.              
                                                                                             
                   By using several cockroach species this study examines the                
              effects of diverse cockroach attributes on expression of fever.                
                                                                                             
              This is the first study to 1) examine fever in a worm-insect                   
              association, and to assess its effects on survival and                         
              reproduction of several host 2) test the alternate hypothesis                  
              that altered behavior in parasitized animals may benefit the host
