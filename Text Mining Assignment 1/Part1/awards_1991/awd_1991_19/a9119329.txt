Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This collaborative project extends and expands a research project              
              on organizations.  The investigators identify organizations which              
              transmit important political and social values, and study how those            
              organizations grow and decline.  They are developing a model of                
              the ecology of organizations based on models of spatial diffusion              
              and organizational properties.  The research aids in developing a              
              comparative theory of culture relating culture production to                   
              changes in organizations, historical change, and environmental                 
              conditions.  In particular, PIs hope to improve understanding of               
              such phenomena as declining voter turnout and organizational                   
              failures among U.S. universities.
