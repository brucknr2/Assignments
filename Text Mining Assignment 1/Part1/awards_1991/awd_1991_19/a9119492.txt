Abstract    :
              This is an award to support preliminary research on the                        
              potential use of low intensity, ultrasonic radiation for                       
              desorption of contaminants from solid surfaces to which                        
              they have been adsorbed including contaminated soils and                       
              for regeneration of activated carbon used in water                             
              treatment processes.  The investigator plans on using                          
              ultrasonic radiation that is below the cavitation                              
              threshold of the fluid in contact with the solid surfaces.                     
              The investigator's research plan includes steps to                             
              separate the effects of abrasion, temperature and                              
              ultrasonic vibrations.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Results of this project are expected to identify the                           
              nature of the chemical alteration and possible degradation                     
              when organic contaminants of soil and water are exposed to                     
              high intensity ultrasonic radiation.  This research is                         
              expected to provide knowledge as to potential                                  
              applicability of a process using ultrasonic energy for                         
              decontamination of soil and adsorbents used in treatment                       
              of water and assist in characterizing the process for                          
              potential use in engineering design of decontamination                         
              systems.
