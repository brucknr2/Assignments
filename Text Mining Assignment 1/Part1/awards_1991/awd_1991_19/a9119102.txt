Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will continue on the study of interfaces and              
              non-equilibrium systems driven to steady states by an external                 
              field.  In an ongoing exploration of bulk singularities in driven              
              systems, multi-point correlations will be investigated in models               
              with a uniform drive, annealed random drives, repulsive                        
              interactions, and many species.  Another area of study involves the            
              interfaces in driven systems.  Particularly, the effects of driving            
              on roughening will be studied and selection mechanisms for the                 
              variety of bulk phases induced by different boundary conditions                
              will be investigated.  Additional studies will be undertaken on the            
              interplay between bulk and interfacial fluctuations; morphological             
              transitions due to curvature dominated closed membranes; and,                  
              conceptual questions associated with capillary wave theory.  Long              
              term projects include a thorough analysis of finite size effects               
              and quenched impurities in driven systems, a wider class of                    
              competing dynamical models and applications to a variety of other              
              related phenomena.
