Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Trinity University                    
              acquire a luminescence spectrometer to support the research and                
              education programs in chemistry at this undergraduate                          
              institution.  Among the areas of chemical research that will be                
              enhanced by this acquisition are 1)  photophysical properties                  
              of tetrapyrroles and bilirubin analogs, and 2)  sterically                     
              hindered substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons derived                  
              from fluoranthene.  The luminescence spectrometer will be a                    
              significant addition to the department's instrumentation                       
              capabilities, greatly enhancing current and future research                    
              efforts dealing with emission from electronically excited                      
              states.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Luminescence is light emission which occurs during the decay of                
              an excited state of a molecule, and is called fluorescence if                  
              it occurs immediately or phosphorescence if it occurs a long                   
              time after the formation of the excited state.  Luminescence                   
              spectroscopy is a very sensitive tool for measuring very low                   
              concentrations of biomolecules and in studying kinetics and                    
              mechanisms of photochemical reactions.
