Abstract    :
              This proposal, submitted by the National Action Council for                    
              Minorities in Engineering, is for $262,643 and will support an                 
              effort to develop a one-year,  dual component faculty/student                  
              cultural diversity program for improving the engineering school                
              environment for minority students.  The faculty component would                
              focus on increasing the sensitivity of engineering faculty to                  
              cultural differences within their student population and the                   
              importance of considering these differences within the advising                
              role.  The student component would be geared to helping them learn             
              to cope with an environment that is likely to be significantly                 
              different from any previous educational experience.  A pilot                   
              program would be carried out between April 1992 and March 1993.                
              From April 1993 to June 1994, NACME would be involved in helping               
              the engineering program pilot site take the program through its                
              second year.  During those 15 months NACME would also be involved              
              in identifying other engineering school programs that would                    
              institute a program based on the model program.
