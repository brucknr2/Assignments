Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, a collaborative effort between the San Diego                     
              Supercomputer Center (SDSC) and the University of California, San              
              Diego, (UCSD), addresses performance analysis on the Internet and              
              development of models to predict such performance.  There is a                 
              need for tools that analyze and model available network data and               
              also assist in defining data sets for network evaluation and                   
              optimization.  Such capabilities will become more critical as the              
              Internet and its NREN component develop higher performance and                 
              are are more high spread.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Some areas of initial investigation include assessments of                     
              network latencies, identification of traffic patterns and service              
              requirements, parameterization of network performance, and                     
              exploration of issues surrounding the granularity and scope of                 
              collected network data.***
