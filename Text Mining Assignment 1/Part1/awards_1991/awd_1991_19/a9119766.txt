Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to find the simplest atmospheric model             
              that captures the essential physics of the dynamics of long-lived              
              planetary features such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot and other                  
              coherent vortices, the Dark  Spot of Neptune, the polar vortex of              
              Saturn, and the Earth's Antarctic polar vortex.  The philosophy is             
              that a simple, but qualitatively correct model is the key to a good            
              physical understanding of the mechanisms that govern planetary                 
              vortices, their wakes, and their waves.
