Abstract    :
              The Earth is situated in a solar wind, whose origins are unclear.              
              The source of this is "coronal holes".  This study deals with                  
              this plasma source.  The fact that Alfven waves may play a                     
              significant role in the energy balance in solar coronal holes has              
              been known for many years.  The traditional view has been that                 
              these waves are generated in the convectively unstable                         
              subphotospheric layers.  Just very recently Parker (1991,                      
              Astrophys. J., 372, 719) and Moore et al. (1991, Astrophys. J.,                
              376, in press) have suggested that these waves can be generated                
              by small-scale magnetic fields assoicated with the network and                 
              presented some qualitative arguments to support this idea.                     
              Because there are also other mechanisms of Alfven wave generation              
              operating in the solar atmosphere, more detailed calculations are              
              needed to estimate which mechanism dominates in the excitation of              
              these waves.  The PI propose to calculate the wave energy spectra              
              and energy fluxes for three different mechanisms of Alfven wave                
              generation: (1) excitation of transverse waves on magnetic flux                
              tubes by the subphotospheric convection, (2) generation of                     
              transverse tube waves by the photospheric granulation, and (3)                 
              excitation of Alfven waves by the network microflaring.  To find               
              out which mechanism is dominant in supplying the wave energy into              
              solar coronal holes, the PI will compare all three obtained wave               
              energy fluxes with total heat input required by observations.                  
              This study will be important in ongoing efforts to understand                  
              the principal energy sources for solar coronal holes and the                   
              basic physical processes responsible for creating the                          
              heliosphere, in which the Earth resides.
