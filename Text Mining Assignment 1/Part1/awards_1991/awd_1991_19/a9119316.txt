Abstract    :
              The Sixth Biophysical Discussion:  "Biophysics and Recombinant                 
              DNA" will foster an examination of molecular genetic                           
              manipulations as they reveal physical and structural properties                
              of proteins.  Basic difficulties will be confronted, such as the               
              structures of newly created species, the innovative use of                     
              mutagenesis to test specific hypotheses, and modeling built on                 
              computation or computer graphics as compared with the need for                 
              more accurate three-dimensional molecular structures.  Proposed                
              topics for this Discussion include gap junctions; acetylcholine                
              receptors; ion-coupled transporters; bacterial chemotaxic                      
              receptors; rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin, sodium, potassium,                 
              and calcium channels; the bacterial flagellar "motor"; receptors               
              and other membrane-spanning or lipid-linked proteins; protein                  
              design and engineering; protein folding; and protein/polypeptide               
              insertion.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The Organizers of the Discussion hope that bringing together                   
              scientists working in these topical areas will raise important                 
              new questions, clarify issues and problems and resolve some                    
              research controversies.
