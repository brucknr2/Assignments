Abstract    :
                   "Root-colonizing" microbes may not be confined to the soil;               
              instead, populations over large regions may be linked by various               
              biotic and abiotic transport systems whose strength, perhaps, is               
              limited by the densities achieved locally.  Research will develop              
              and validate an epidemiological model that links local processes               
              of growth and movement from single root systems to larger scale                
              process of transport, colonization, and persistence.  The work                 
              will be conducted with a specific model system - a bacterium,                  
              engineered with unique markers to facilitate fluid                             
              experimentation, and an insect that feeds on corn roots- but the               
              questions, experimental approach, statistics and models are more               
              general.  This work takes on special significance since bacteria               
              are being engineered for many environmental and agricultural                   
              functions, and will not be endowed with trivial or ecologically                
              irrelevant traits.
