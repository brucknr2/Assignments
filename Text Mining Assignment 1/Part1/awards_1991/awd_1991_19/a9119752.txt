Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Bowers of the University                 
              of California, Santa Barbara, will study the structure,                        
              energetics, and reaction mechanisms of organometallic and                      
              cluster ionic systems.  Metal-ligand bond strengths will be                    
              obtained as well as photodissociation dynamics data.  The newly                
              developed techniques of Ion Structural Chromatography and                      
              Electronic State Chromatography will also be used to obtain                    
              structural and bond-energy information.

              Ion-molecule reactions are known to be important in defining                   
              the composition of the outer part of the earth's atmosphere as                 
              well as in controlling the chemistry of interstellar clouds,                   
              flames, plasmas, and discharges.  An investigation of the                      
              processes involved in ion-molecule interactions may also be                    
              important for understanding cluster formation in gaseous or                    
              condensed phases.  This project will study a variety of                        
              structural and dynamical processes which will aid in a                         
              fundamental understanding of many of these phenomena.
