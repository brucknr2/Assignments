Abstract    :
                   This award will provide a stipend for a minority graduate                 
              student, Mr. Pablo Saez.  He was an "honorable mention" two                    
              years ago in the Minority Graduate Fellowship competition.                     
              The Physics Division is providing equivalent to such a                         
              fellowship as part of its plan to encourage minority students                  
              in physics.
