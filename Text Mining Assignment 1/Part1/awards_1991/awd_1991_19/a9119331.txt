Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research, jointly supported by the Division of Cellular           
              Biosciences and the Division of Chemistry, is the continuation of an           
              interdisciplinary project to understand the action of juvenile hormone         
              at the molecular level combining the disciplines of chemistry,                 
              molecular biology, and physiology.  Major keys include understanding           
              the molecular basis for hormonal regulation of gene expression in              
              insects (L.M. Riddiford), biochemical and molecular studies of JH              
              metabolism and synthesis (B.D. Hammock), and use of high specific              
              activity labeled JHs and JHs (G.D. Prestwich).  Three benefits                 
              result from this project.  First, the scientific work is directed              
              at a fundamental problem in regulation of gene expression, and the             
              metamorphosis of insects in and easily accessible and fascinating              
              model system for this study.  Second, the practical implications               
              of this work may lead to the development of new biologically                   
              specific and environmentally safer insect control starategies for              
              crop pest.  Third, the interdiscriplinary training required for the            
              students postdoctoral fellow and faculty researchers involved                  
              enhances the quality and breadth of scientific inquiry in each                 
              laboratory.
