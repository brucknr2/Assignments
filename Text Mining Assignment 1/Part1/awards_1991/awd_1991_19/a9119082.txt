Abstract    :
                   This study will to examine the causes and temporal signature              
              of changes in permeability induced by moderate to major scale                  
              earthquakes.  Almost all previous work on examining earthquake                 
              related changes in hydrology has focused on the time period                    
              immediately following the earthquake.  This work attempts to obtain            
              a more definitive understanding of the coupling which exists                   
              between earthquakes and hydrology by examining the pre-seismic, co-            
              seismic and post-seismic behavior of surface and ground water flow.            
              We will examine the response of the San Lorenzo drainage basin to              
              the Loma Prieta earthquake (10/17/89, M 7.1) and its major                     
              foreshocks.  Because of the density of stream gaging stations in               
              the basin and the number of water wells in the region, this study              
              will provide an opportunity to examine earthquake induced                      
              hydrologic changes in detail.  We propose to examine the historical            
              relation between stream flow and rainfall in the region, the                   
              groundwater hydrology of the  basin in detail (by chemically                   
              sampling and hydraulically testing existing wells), and the state              
              of stress in the near surface sandstones and shales in the northern            
              portion of the basin.
