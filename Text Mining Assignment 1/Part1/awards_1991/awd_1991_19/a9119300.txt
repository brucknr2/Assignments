Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Ohnishi has previously determined the unique ligand structure              
              of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster, using Q-band 15N-ENDOR analysis             
              of genetically amplified R. capsulatus bc1 complex (in                         
              collaboration with Dr. B. Hoffman).  She has also assigned possible            
              coordinating amino acid residues based on EPR studies of a set of              
              site-directed capsulatus mutants (with Dr. F. Daldal).  She now                
              plans to consolidate this assignment and extend it to test the                 
              proposed role of histidine ligands as hydrogen-bonding sites of the            
              ubiquinone in the "Qo" pocket.  Previously she proposed a unique               
              electron gating mechanism of the paired, edge to edge, Qs species              
              in the mammalian succinate-Q oxidoreductase system.  Now she                   
              proposes to investigate the molecular mechanism and protein                    
              architecture in the "Qs" domain, utilizing well-developed site-                
              directed mutagenesis systems of E. coli and B. subtilis succinate-Q            
              oxidoreductase (with Drs. R. Gennis and Dr. L. Heterstedt), and E              
              coli fumarate-QH2 oxidoreductase (with Dr. G. Cecchini).  These                
              three types of enzyme differ in their association with heme b.  She            
              will use advanced EPR, ENDOR and genetic engineering techniques.               
              This project will enhance our understanding of the electron and                
              proton transfer mechanism in energy transducing membranes.
