Abstract    :
                   With the aim of understanding the process and mechanisms of               
              molecular evolution, two related research projects are proposed.               
              The first project is for studying the rates of nucleotide                      
              substitution among the four nucleotide A, T, C, and G for                      
              several different sets of genes and for developing mathematical                
              models of nucleotide substitution that are more realistic than                 
              the ones currently available.  The actual substitution rates will              
              be estimated by the maximum parsimony method for closely related               
              DNA sequences after the accuracy of the method is studied by                   
              computer simulation.  The second project is concerned with the                 
              evolution of immune system genes in vertebrates and antigenic and              
              nonantigenic genes in the influenza A virus.  Since the DNA                    
              sequences for the genes for the major histocompatibility complex,              
              immunoglobulins, and T-cell receptors (three major gene families               
              of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily) are now available for                  
              many vertebrate species, including sharks and teleosts, the PI                 
              plans to study the origin and evolution of these gene families.                
              We also plan to study the evolutionary history of various strains              
              of the influenza A virus and the evolution of its pathogenicity.
