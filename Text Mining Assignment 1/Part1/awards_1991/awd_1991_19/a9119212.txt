Abstract    :
                   Traditionally, the ear region is the preeminent source of                 
              comparative morphological information for evolutionary studies on              
              mammals.  It also presents one of the most oft cited examples of               
              evolutionary change in Biology textbooks: the evolution of the                 
              three middle-ear bones (ossicles) of mammals from the lower jaws               
              of more primitive forms. Despite its preeminence, knowledge of the             
              ear region remains incomplete.  During recent years, remarkable                
              fossil finds have dramatically increased what is known of the ear              
              and its ossicles in extinct mammals and raised questions about                 
              previous views on the evolution of this region and of mammals in               
              general.  To fully evaluate these fossils and new evolutionary                 
              questions, it is necessary to increase comparative knowledge of the            
              ear in modern mammals, both in numbers and in level of detail.                 
              This research gathers comparative information on the embryology of             
              the ear region in modern mammals to evaluate the evolution of this             
              complex system and its role in the evolutionary history of mammals.
