Abstract    :
              9119575  Dill  This proposal would provide primarily provide postdoctoral 
              support to this group of researchers to work on the development  of potential
              function of intermediate and variable resolution and  the interfacing of
              high-resolution force-fields with low  resolution statistical mechanics
              methods.  Four specific  subprojects are planned:  the integrating of the
              Poisson-  Boltzmann electrostatics with microscopic models, the development  of
              intermediate resolution force-field in conjunction with atomic  resolution and
              fast lattice models, the determination of local  minima of low-resolution
              structures via atomic resolution force-  fields, the integration of polymer
              statistical mechanics with  force-fields.  In addition this group will attract
              postdocs with  backgrounds in nonbiological areas such as mathematics or 
              computer sciences, thus providing a broad, interdisciplinary  training
              environment.  ***
