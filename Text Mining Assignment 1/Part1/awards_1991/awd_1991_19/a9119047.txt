Abstract    :
                   This supports a summer institute to study parallel computation,           
              with the purpose of strengthening the interaction of the theory and            
              practical communities.  The institute, entitled Dartmouth Institute            
              for Advanced Graduate Studies (DAGS), will address in its first year,          
              June 1992, issues and obstacles in the practical implementation of             
              parallel algorithms and the use of parallel machines.  The main                
              session of the 1992 DAGS PC (Parallel Computation) will extend for two         
              weeks, with the option for certain participants to remain for a more           
              extended working period.  The institute will be both a forum and a             
              working environment.  The institute will also be interdisciplinary,            
              with emphasis on interdisciplinary involvement from within Dartmouth           
              in the first year.
