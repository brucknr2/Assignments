Abstract    :
                   This award supports planning activities in preparation for                
              high-resolution paleoclimate studies in the large lakes of the                 
              East African Rift Valley.  This effort, entitled the                           
              International Decade for the East African Lakes (IDEAL), resulted              
              from a workshop held in Bern, Switzerland in March 1990.  The                  
              African rift valley lakes hold a record of climatic change in the              
              tropics that is unparalleled anywhere in the world.  It is                     
              resolvable on a time scale of years or decades and may be                      
              continuous back to 10-20 million years before present.  The lakes              
              respond dramatically to relatively minor changes in climate,                   
              leaving strong signals in sediment composition.  Our ability to                
              interpret these signals, however, is constrained by our limited                
              knowledge about how the lakes respond to climate forcing.  We                  
              know little about the biological, chemical physical dynamics of                
              these lakes, or how they impact sediment composition.  A                       
              comprehensive, multi-disciplinary study is proposed that will                  
              involve scientists from the North America, Europe and Africa.
