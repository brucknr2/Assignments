Abstract    :
              Tekalp         Artifacts due to involuntary patient motion have been a  major
              source of image degradation in 2-D and 3-D Fourier Magnetic  Resonance Imaging
              (MRI) for many years.  These artifacts, often  called "ghosts," manifest
              themselves as a series of repeated and  blurred versions of some features in
              the patient.  Most of the  contemporary methods which account for motion
              effects require  additional hardware or instrumentation to monitor the patient 
              motion.         This research is examining novel signal/image processing 
              methods for the detection and correction of motion artifacts in  MRI by means
              of postprocessing of the motion-corrupted raw MR  data.  The research entails
              modeling (mathematically) the data  acquisition process in the presence of
              arbitrary patient motion,  the development of signal/image enhancement
              algorithms based on  the resulting model, and their verification with
              controlled MRI  experiments as well as clinical MRI data.  A major advantage of
               the proposed methods is that they can be implemented in software  and do not
              require any additional hardware installation to  existing systems.
