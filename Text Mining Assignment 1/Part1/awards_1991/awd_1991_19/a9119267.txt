Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Continental Scientific Drilling is an essential activity of               
              programs within the DOE, NSF, and USGS.  The present U.S.                      
              Continental Scientific Drilling Program consists of a coordinated              
              set of these activities that is also consistent with the missions              
              of each Agency.  Because the programs of the participating Agencies            
              are related in scientific interests, a coordinated interagency                 
              effort in continental scientific drilling is both cost effective               
              and highly beneficial.  The Interagency Coordinating Group for                 
              Continental Scientific Drilling (ICG), formally in existence since             
              the signing of the Interagency Accord on Continental Scientific                
              Drilling in 1984, provides this coordination.                                  
                                                                                             
                   This action provides funds in the form of an interagency                  
              transfer to the USGS to cover NSF's share of ICG expenses (Annual              
              Report to Congress, ICG staff, workshop reports, etc.).                        
              Specifically, a expenses related to the Environmental Impact                   
              Statement for the Katmai Scientific Drilling Project which is being            
              coordinated for the ICG by the USGS.
