Abstract    :
                   This study will investigate the processes involved in the                 
              evolution of gene regulation.  The sarcomeric myosin alkali light              
              chain gene (Mlc1) in Drosophila undergoes alternative splicing of              
              the pre-mRNA and encodes two Mlc1 polypeptides, one of which                   
              lacks exon 5 (14 amino acids).  The deficient form is unique to                
              the indirect flight muscles which power flight.  They will                     
              compare patterns of sequence variation in the regions of the                   
              Mlc1 gene that are under selective constraint in several                       
              Drosophila species and representative species of the orders                    
              Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, and Odonata.  These patterns              
              of sequence variation will reveal whether sufficient variability               
              in splicing exists to enable measurement of evolutionary change                
              in this system.
