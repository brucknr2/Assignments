Abstract    :
              This research proposes to use gene sequences from mitochondrial                
              DNA (mtDNA) to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of the               
              species of the birds-of-paradise (family Paradisaeidae).  The                  
              results of this research will be compared with morphological data              
              collected in previous studies in order to describe and explain                 
              differences and similarities in their rates of change.  The                    
              phylogenetic hypotheses will also allow inferences regarding the               
              history of ecological and behavioral change during the                         
              diversification of these birds and thus will contribute to our                 
              understanding of how patterns of diversity within continental                  
              biotas are established over time.
