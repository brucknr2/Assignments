Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Hobbs will continue his observational study of the origin and              
              the evolution of the element lithium in our Galaxy over essentially            
              the full history of the Galaxy.  The objective of the work is to               
              answer as directly as possible three closely related questions:                
              (1) What lithium abundance was produced in nucleosynthesis at the              
              Big Bang?  (2) After the birth of our Galaxy, how has the Galactic             
              lithium abundance evolved with time, and owing to what physical                
              processes?  (3) During the main sequence lifetimes of stars with               
              masses of about one Solar mass, what mechanisms progressively                  
              destroy the lithium in these stars' atmospheres which was initially            
              present?  The method to be used consists of measurements of a                  
              lithium spectral line in an unprecedented large number of extremely            
              old, metal-poor halo dwarf stars; in main sequence, proper motion              
              members of the old open cluster NGC 2420, which has an age near 4              
              billion years; and in a comprehensive survey of the G and early K              
              type main-sequence members of the Hyades cluster of stars.
