Abstract    :
              Professor Robert Pecora is supported by a grant from the                       
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              theoretical and experimental research on thermal motions in                    
              liquid and polymer systems.  Professor Pecora will emply a                     
              number of experimental methods including interferometry, photon                
              correlation spectroscopy, forced Rayleigh scattering and                       
              transient electric birefringence to study dilute and non-dilute                
              solutions of rigid and semi-rigid rod-like molecules.  He will                 
              also study composite solutions consisting of various                           
              combinations of rods, spheres, and coils.  Some of the rod-like                
              molecules he will study are DNA restriction fragments.  The                    
              theoretical effort will involve both formal theoretical                        
              modeling and Brownian dynamics computer simulations.

              Composite liquids are a ubiquitous class of materials which                    
              contain polymer, particles and solvent.  They are used as                      
              ceramic precursors, lubricants, paints and coatings, adhesives,                
              and in chromatographic columns.  Due to their complexity and                   
              the lack of adequate model systems, the interactions between                   
              the species in such systems are not well understood.  Pecora                   
              has constructed a model rod/sphere composite liquid whose                      
              dynamics can be studied over a wide range of composition of                    
              both the rods and the spheres using an experimental technique                  
              known as dynamic light scattering.
