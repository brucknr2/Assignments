Abstract    :
                   In the last few years, several cosmic-ray-produced                        
              radionuclides (10Be, 14C, 26Al, 36Cl), as well as stable, 3He, Ne and          
              22Ne have been discovered in terrestrial surface materials.  Some of           
              these nuclides are already employed as tracers in studies of                   
              geophysical and geological phenomena and open up a new field of                
              study and are expected to provide essential data on rates of change            
              in global change research.  Such studies require an accurate                   
              knowledge of the production rates, present and past, which are not             
              currently available.  The relevant excitation functions for                    
              different nuclides are not known.  A simulation of the cosmic ray              
              flux is a rather complex endeavor.  We propose a direct method for             
              the determination of some of present production rates, by exposing             
              relevant targets at mountain altitudes.  Production rates averaged             
              over the last solar cycles can be obtained by comparing production             
              rates with neutron monitor data.  We propose to determine the                  
              relevant production ratio P21/P26 of the cosmic-ray- produced                  
              nuclides 21Ne and 26Al by isotopic measurements of Ne in quartz                
              samples.  Average production rates over 104-105 years can be                   
              obtained from measurements of samples of known age.  Measurements              
              of the 3He/21Ne ratio show and that 3He is often incompletely                  
              retained in quartzites.  Therefore, 21Ne production rates and                  
              21Ne/10Be and 21Ne/Al ratios provide essential information, which is           
              required to evaluate erosion rates and to define geological                    
              processes (uplift, variations in ice cover etc).
