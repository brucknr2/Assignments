Abstract    :
              Professor Richard M. Stratt is supported by a grant from the                   
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the                        
              Materials Theory Program to perform theoretical research in                    
              electronic structure of fluids.  Stratt is developing new                      
              theoretical and computational techniques for studying the                      
              electronic structure of liquid state systems which undergo                     
              changes from insulators to semiconductors to metals as a                       
              function of density or composition.  Specific examples which                   
              will be studied include expanded mercury and cesium and molten                 
              arsenic and silicon, which exhibit an unusual level of                         
              cooperativity between the fluid structure and the requirements                 
              imposed by electronic behavior.  Specific problems to be dealt                 
              with involve the effects of electron interaction and                           
              directional binding.                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Not only can one find liquids that are insulating,                             
              semiconducting, and metallic, one can even find liquids that                   
              can be made to transform continuously from one kind of behavior                
              to another as a function of density.  This kind of tunability                  
              is not commonly found in either small molecules or in bulk                     
              solids.  A fundamental theoretical understanding of these                      
              detailed interactions at the atomic or molecular level could                   
              very likely lead to the development of new fluid materials with                
              tunable electronic behavior.
