Abstract    :
              The Capsid of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is an icosahedral            
              (T=16) protein shell approximately 15 nm thick and 125nm in                    
              diameter.  In the intact virus, the capsid contains the viral dsDNA            
              and it is surrounded by a lipid membrane.  The goal of this project            
              is to assemble the HSV-1 capsid in vitro beginning with purified               
              capsid proteins.  Capsids will be isolated from the nuclei of HSV-             
              1- infected cells and dissociated into their six component protein             
              with dissociating/denaturing agents such as guanidine-HC1 or urea.             
              Individual capsid proteins will then be purified and added together            
              under conditions designed to promote their re-assembly into                    
              icosahedral capsids.  Reaction mixtures will be examined for the               
              presence of re-assembled capsids by electron microscopy, sucrose               
              density gradient ultracentrifugation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel                
              electrophoresis.  Also, studies involving the use of specific                  
              monoclonal antibodies will be carried out to define the locations              
              of capsid proteins VP19, VP23, and VP26.  Specific goals of the                
              project are to:  (1) define the morphology, total mass and protein             
              stoichiometry of torus-shaped structures self-assembled in vitro               
              from purified capsid protein VP22a; (2) identify conditions in                 
              which native VP26 can re-attach to HSV-1 capsids that lack it and              
              define the location of VP26 in reconstituted capsids; (3) define               
              conditions in which purified VP, the major capsid protein, can                 
              assembly in vitro into T=16 icosahedra.  Assembly may require the              
              presence of other capsid proteins such as the scaffolding protein,             
              VP22a: and (4) prepare monoclonal antibodies specific for capsid               
              proteins VP19, VP23, and VP26, and use them (in conjunction with               
              electron microscopic methods) to localize their cognate proteins in            
              the HSV-1 capsid.
