Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Louisiana Tech University requests support from NSF for                        
              connection of their campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the                 
              midlevel network located in the southeastern United States.  It                
              will provide operations management and information services and                
              it will give Louisiana Tech University a 56 thousand bits per                  
              second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million                
              bits per second) National Backbone network.                                    
                                                                                             
              The University needs greater functionality and network speed to                
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to collaborate with peers at                   
              other schools on common projects.  Students and faculty research               
              will benefit from the link.  This is also a unique opportunity                 
              for the school to explore innovative educational resources.***
