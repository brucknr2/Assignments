Abstract    :
              This Symposium presents original papers on the relation of                     
              artificial intelligence to the mathematical theory of                          
              computation.  These papers by distinguished authors cover the                  
              relevant aspects of this topic.  They are mostly research papers               
              and some are historical papers tracing the development of the                  
              field.  A volume of proceedings of the Symposium is to be                      
              published by Academic Press.  The Symposium is expected to make a              
              contribution to the field of artificial intelligence by extending              
              extant work on artificial intelligence theory and by bringing                  
              together diverse strands of it.  This event is held at Stanford                
              University on September 6 and 7, 1991.  One of the leading                     
              pioneers of artificial intelligence is Professor John McCarthy.                
              The Symposium recognizes his important contributions to the field              
              and many of the presenters are his students and colleagues.
