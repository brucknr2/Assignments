Abstract    :
              1Professor Karplus is jointly supported by a grant from the                    
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the                        
              Biophysics Program to perform theoretical studies related to                   
              biomolecular chemistry.  The research is directed at the use of                
              theoretical methods to increase our understanding of the                       
              structure, dynamics and function of biologically interesting                   
              molecules.  The methods to be used include ab initio and                       
              semiempirical quantum mechanical calculations and molecular                    
              dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.  Particular emphasis will                
              be placed on the role of solvent in biological systems.                        
              Specific problems to be addressed include: 1) solvation effects                
              on internal molecular potentials; 2) ion transport through the                 
              gramacidin channel; and 3) reactions in the gas phase, in                      
              solution, and in enzymes.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              State-of-the-art computer simulations of the dynamical behavior                
              of biological molecules such as enzymes have provided valuable                 
              insights regarding the structure and function of these                         
              important and facinating chemical catalysts.  This fundamental                 
              research has important implications in understanding biological                
              function, and has a long range impact in the area of human                     
              health and disease.  Professor Karplus continues to follow a                   
              program of research aimed at elucidating biological function                   
              through computer simulations.
