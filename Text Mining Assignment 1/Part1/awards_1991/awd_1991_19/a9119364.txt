Abstract    :
              This study of the dynamics of a stable atmospheric boundary layer              
              will be carried out jointly by the University of California, Davis,            
              and the NOAA Wave Propagation Laboratory, and will concentrate on              
              the importance of intermittent and episodic forcing mechanisms in              
              determining the structure and energy transfer within the lowest                
              layers of the antarctic troposphere.  The study will combine                   
              ground-based remote sensing techniques with theoretical and                    
              modelling analyses, particularly of wave phenomena.                            
                                                                                             
              The field phase of the project will be carried out at                          
              Amundsen-Scott South Pole station because of its reliably stable               
              boundary layer, its smooth air-snow interface, and its lack of a               
              diurnal solar cycle.  A monostatic Sodar, the acoustic analogue of             
              Radar, will provide continuous time-height depictions of the                   
              boundary layer structure, while a Radar profiler will be used to               
              extend the observations to an altitude of 3000 meters.  Two arrays             
              of microbarographs will monitor the passage of internal gravity                
              waves, while a network of Automatic Weather Stations on the 100                
              kilometer scale will provide information on the regional pressure              
              distribution.
