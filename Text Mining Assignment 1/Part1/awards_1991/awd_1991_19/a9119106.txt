Abstract    :
                   Paleomagnetic measurements on sedimentary rocks have been used            
              in the past to reconstruct plate motions, but recent work has shown            
              there to be a systematic shallowing of paleomagnetic inclinations              
              in these rocks when compared with volcanic rocks.  Thus a possibly             
              serious error exists in paleolatitude calculation conducted to                 
              date.  This study will systematically test the expected latitudinal            
              dependence of inclination shallowing using lithified Atlantic DSDP             
              sediments.  Detailed study of the process will be conducted on a               
              small group of preselected samples.  The results will help resolve             
              discrepancies in the existing database and will thereby permit                 
              accurate reconstruction of past tectonic motions.
