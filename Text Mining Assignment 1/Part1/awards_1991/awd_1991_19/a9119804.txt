Abstract    :
                   This award will allow the Florida Museum of Natural History               
              (FLMNH) to incorporate and computerize the Pierce Brodkorb                     
              collection of Recent and fossil birds (PBOC) into their                        
              ornithological and paleontological collections, respectively.                  
              Brodkorb, a distinguished ornithologist, amassed an                            
              internationally important collection of 31,000 skeletal specimens              
              of extant and fossil birds, which he donated to FLMNH upon his                 
              retirement in 1989.  The osteological material represents some                 
              2500 species and is 11th largest in the world in terms of                      
              specimens and fifth largest in number of species.  The fossil                  
              material includes the type specimens of 42 new species and the                 
              collection as a whole figured in 29 projects for graduate degrees              
              at the University of Florida.  After incorporation, the FLMNH                  
              avian osteology collection will rank fifth in size in the United               
              States, and the fossil bird collection fourth.  The latter is one              
              of the finest in the world.  Each collection is integral to                    
              biological research and education at the University of Florida -               
              - each collection is well used by researchers and students at                  
              FLMNH and elsewhere.  This use will increase with incorporation                
              of the PBOC.  The incorporation plan involves identification of                
              5000 fossil specimens, cataloguing, computerization and rehousing              
              of the entire collection.  FLMNH is providing the equipment.
