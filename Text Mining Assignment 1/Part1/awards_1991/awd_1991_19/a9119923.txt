Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs propose to use the Jicamarca MST Radar for studies of             
              equatorial middle atmosphere dynamics.  The focus will be on the               
              wave motions forcing the large-scale equatorial circulations in the            
              stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere and on the                    
              seasonal and short-term variability of the forcing and responses.              
              The PIs plan to emphasize vertical coupling and transports of                  
              energy and momentum.  Finally, they will study the variability of              
              gravity waves, tides, Kelvin waves, and mixed Rossby-gravity waves             
              on both the consequences of cross-equatorial flows and the                     
              influences of extra-tropical planetary waves on the dynamics at                
              large and small scales.
