Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  Health complaints in Bangladesh will be studied in order to               
              understand what they accomplish and how they help constitute                   
              Bengali personhood.  Methods will include: 1) participant-                     
              observation in homes and medical settings in a small town, and 2)              
              recording of complaints to be submitted to 3) ethnographic                     
              discourse analysis.  Discourse analysis will focus on the form                 
              and function of the complaints as speech acts.  Off-record goals               
              of these acts will be explored through conversation-internal                   
              indications and in interviews (with participants and others).                  
              Defining characteristics of "health complaints" will be                        
              described.  Parameters of variation to be explored include gender              
              and relative age of speakers and hearers and the nature of the                 
              speech setting (home versus medical).  Analysis will produce                   
              taxonomic, pragmatic, and cultural-symbolic models for the                     
              understanding of complaints in their contexts.  Because                        
              complaints-- particularly by females-- may themselves be viewed                
              as selfish actions by Bengalis (particularly males), models will               
              relate complaints to ideals and actualities of self-other                      
              boundaries, much discussed in South Asian ethnography.                         
              Psychological and medical anthropologists in South Asia have                   
              considered whether somatic symptoms can be considered indirect                 
              expressions of social or psychological distress; the research                  
              will uncover linguistic and other behavioral evidence relevant to              
              this question.
