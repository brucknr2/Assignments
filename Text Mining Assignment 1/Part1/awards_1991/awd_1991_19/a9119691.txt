Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics will include efforts to                   
              test and to extend the current understanding of the "Standard                  
              Model" of subatomic interactions, and efforts to search for a                  
              unified theory of all the forces, including gravity.  The                      
              Standard Model analyses will concentrate on studies of                         
              elementary particles containing heavy quarks, high precision                   
              analyses of the effects of the electromagnetic forces, and                     
              calculations of the scattering of elementary particles.  The                   
              unification studies will focus on string theories of all the                   
              forces and theories in less than four space-time dimensions.                   
              Work will also be done in astrophysics.  This broad program of                 
              research will contribute to our understanding of the                           
              elementary particles, the basic forces, and astrophysical                      
              systems.
