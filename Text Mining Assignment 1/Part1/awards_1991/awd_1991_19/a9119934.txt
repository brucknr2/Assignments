Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will be used to cover participation costs of selected               
              attendees to IAU Colloquium 135 entitled "Complementary Approaches             
              to Double and Multiple Star Research".  The meeting will be held               
              near Atlanta, Georgia, April 5-10, 1992.  The theme of the                     
              Colloquium will be the combination of observational data obtained              
              from complementary techniques -- primarily from astrometry,                    
              spectroscopy, photometry, and interferometry -- to more fully                  
              ascertain the physical and dynamical properties of binary and                  
              multiple star systems.
