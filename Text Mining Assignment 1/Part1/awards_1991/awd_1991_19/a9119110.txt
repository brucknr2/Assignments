Abstract    :
              Boron isotopic ratios will prove useful in clarifying the source               
              of B and the processes by which it is incorporated into arc magmas.            
              This project is to analyze basaltic lavas from a number of volcanic            
              arcs to establish correlations with such factors as subduction                 
              rates, thermal state, geometry, etc.  For comparison, selected                 
              lavas from within-plate settings (Ocean islands and spreading                  
              centers) will be analyzed to better define the B isotopic                      
              composition of mantle regions that are unaffected by subduction.               
              Also it is planned to analyze samples from two progressive                     
              metamorphic suites to evaluate isotopic fractionation effects                  
              accompanying dehydration and recrystallization.  The proposed work             
              is relevant to studies of fluid-rock interaction and mass transport            
              via hydrothermal brines, to tracer studies of subduction-related               
              processes, and to studies of the evolution of hydrothermal mineral             
              deposits and effects of prograde metamorphism on devolatilization              
              of crustal rocks.
