Abstract    :
                 This grant is to support a two day symposium on "Natural and                
              Adaptive Immune Mechanisms in Insects" at the 1991 Annual Meeting              
              of the American Society of Zoologists.  The symposium will be                  
              subdivided into three major sections:  cell mediuated immunity in              
              insects; humoral mediators of insect immunity; and suppressive                 
              agents of insect immunity.  This will be the first time that both              
              the inductive and suppressive sides of insect immunity will be                 
              discussed in a common forum in such a comprehensive manner.  The               
              contributors to the symposium are either established investigators             
              with prominent reputations in their respective fields, or young                
              investigators who show great promise for the future.                           
                                                                                             
              The major goal of the symposium is to bring together investigators             
              who are sutdying different aspects of insect immunity, and provide             
              them with a unique opportunity to exchange ideas that will lead to             
              new interpretations of existing data and the development of new                
              collaborations and approaches fo the future study of insect                    
              immunity.
