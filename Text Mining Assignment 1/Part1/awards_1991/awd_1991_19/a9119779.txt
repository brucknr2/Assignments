Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Animals affect plant community structure and dynamics directly                 
              (consumption) and indirectly (physical disturbance).  It is clear              
              that in addition, the spatial pattern of impacts also                          
              significantly influences the structure of plant communities.                   
              This collaborative research project will test a series of                      
              hypotheses concerning the spatial patterns of herbivore influence              
              using a system of animal-generated disturbances (plains pocket                 
              gophers in herbaceous plant communities) that occur in spatially               
              predictable patterns (uniformly spaced burrows and aggregated                  
              mounds on the surface).  The impact of the spatial pattern of                  
              disturbance on resource distribution and plant community structure             
              will be investigated.  Furthermore, these patterns will be analyzed            
              at several scales (from microscale neighborhood effects to                     
              field-wide patterns).  Comparisons also will be made between two               
              sites that differ significantly in soil characteristics, allowing              
              analysis of the amplitude of herbivore-generated effects in                    
              relation to soil fertility.  This work will contribute                         
              significantly to understanding the role of animals in plant                    
              community structure by determining the patterns of animal                      
              activities and the mechanisms by which they are translated into                
              pattern in the environment, in plant growth and recruitment, and               
              in vegetation across spatial scales ranging from several cm2  to               
              hundreds of m2.
