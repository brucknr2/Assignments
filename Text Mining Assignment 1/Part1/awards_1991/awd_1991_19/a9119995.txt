Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Julius Rebek, Jr. at Massachusetts                
              Institute of Technology.  Systems designed to precisely fix the                
              positions of molecules in space in order to control their                      
              reactivity with neighboring molecules will be studied.  In                     
              particular, a previously reported self-replicating system will                 
              be examined in greater detail.  An imide-ester that can bind                   
              adenine, but not undergo internal acylation, will be used to                   
              shut down the intramolecular base pair components and promote                  
              exponential growth.  More lipophilic and soluble Kemp triacid                  
              imides will also be used so that the concentrations can be                     
              increased.  Proximity complexation in order to enhance the rate                
              of amide formation between two nucleic acid components will                    
              also be examined.                                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              Self-replicating reactions in which the product acts as a                      
              template for its own formation will be studied.  Such systems                  
              stand at the interface of chemistry and biology, and provide                   
              models for selection, competition and mutation; the essential                  
              components of chemical evolution.  The synthesis of efficient                  
              replicators and the design of nucleic acid-like templates for                  
              the synthesis of peptide sequences will be undertaken.  These                  
              new molecules are expected to offer a link between today's                     
              biological structures and their prebiotic counterparts.
