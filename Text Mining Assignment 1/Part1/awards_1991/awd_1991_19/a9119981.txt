Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Mutations in a number of genes in the fruit fly lead to an                     
              overproduction of neuronal precursor cells.  One such gene,                    
              "pecanex", is expressed maternally and codes for a large,                      
              transmembrane protein thought to be involved in cell interactions              
              occurring early in neurogenesis.  The discovery of homology between            
              "pecanex" in the fruit fly and an expressed gene in rat suggests               
              that the study of this gene in the fruit fly may be relevant to                
              understanding neurogenesis in vertebrates.   Immunocytochemistry               
              and in situ hybridization will be used to study the expression of              
              the "pecanex" gene and its gene product in the fruit fly embryo. In            
              addition, molecular techniques will be used to define the coding               
              region of the "pecanex" gene.  The principal investigator teaches              
              at a small undergraduate college and will be training young                    
              scientists in neurogenetics during the course of these studies.
