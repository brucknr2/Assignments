Abstract    :
                   The application of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS)            
              to the study of rock deformation has been disappointing is spite               
              of its apparent potential.  The limitations of this method are due             
              to (1) incomplete or no characterization of the dominant magnetic              
              phases and (2) incomplete or no separation of the contribution of              
              ferri(o)- and paramagnetic minerals.  The present approach                     
              overcomes these limitations by (1) careful optical studies and (2)             
              new methods to measure components of the magnetic fabric.  Complete            
              characterization of the magnetic mineralogy and textural                       
              relationships is a crucial element of the project and will be                  
              carried out using optical (transmitted and reflected) and                      
              (analytical) electron microscopy (SEM, microprobe), anisotropy of              
              magnetic remanence (pARMA) and low-temperature susceptibility.
