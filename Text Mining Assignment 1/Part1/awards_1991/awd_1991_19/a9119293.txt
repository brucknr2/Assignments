Abstract    :
                   This project will investigate the genetic relationships                   
              between the North American, European, and Asian trouts and salmon.             
              This will be done by obtaining data on the DNA sequence of the                 
              ribosomal RNA genes.  Using these data, a tree will be constructed             
              showing the relationships between the various species.  This tree              
              will be compared and combined with trees obtained from analysis of             
              morphological traits and chromosomal variation in these fishes.
