Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary goal of this Dissertation Improvement research is to               
              study affiliative patterns and social relationships in adult male              
              ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta) in Madagascar.  This is a                      
              particularly interesting species for such study as the ringtailed              
              lemur is characterized by female dominance, multimale organization             
              and male migration in contrast to the patterns found in many of the            
              other primates.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Data will be collected on the frequency and nature of affiliative              
              behaviors between males and between males and females over the                 
              period of 14 months; thus covering annual temporal variation.  The             
              information obtained will be related to the seasonal reproductive              
              behavior patterns, seasonal variation and the female dominance                 
              found in this species.  This will be the first detailed examination            
              of male social relationships in a female dominant primate.
