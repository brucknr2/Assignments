Abstract    :
                   Under support from DMS 8713718, a problem of paramount                    
              interest was to generalize elliptic cohomology so as to encompass              
              curves of higher genus.  Y. Shimizu and the investigator found a               
              solution to this problem (over the rational numbers), based on                 
              the idea that affine connections on elliptic curves (which do not              
              generalize to higher genus) should be interpreted as special                   
              cases of the projective connections (which exist for all Riemann               
              surfaces).  This allowed them to associate in a natural way to                 
              any chiral conformal field theory  (in the sense of Segal),                    
              the topological genus defined by the projective connection (or                 
              stress-energy tensor) of the field theory.  They were able                     
              to identify this genus in the case of the charge-one fermion and               
              to show that it reduced (in the case of the elliptic curve) to                 
              the elliptic genus.  A corollary of this construction is that the              
              complex cobordism ring supports a canonical quadratic                          
              differential, closely related in some way to a quadratic                       
              differential supported by the fundamental bosonic                              
              representation of the Virasoro algebra.  The relation between                  
              these two quadratic differentials seems to be of fundamental                   
              importance and will be a major emphasis of the current project.                
              In recent years mathematical constructions inspired by theories                
              used to make sense of subatomic particles have found repeated                  
              application to purely geometric problems.  To their mutual profit              
              physicists and mathematicians are interacting more than ever in                
              exploring these connections, and the investigator is a major                   
              player in this game.
