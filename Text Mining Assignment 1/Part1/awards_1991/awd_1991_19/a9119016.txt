Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              These experiments will examine the basal ganglia, a part of the                
              brain which controls movement.  In the brain nerve cells form                  
              connections with each other and transmit to one another information            
              that is determined partially by the chemicals contained within                 
              them.  However, the ability of the brain in adult mammals to repair            
              itself following injury or disease is limited and not well                     
              understood.  One response of nerve cell death in the basal ganglia             
              is that the surviving cells appear to reorganize.  In other words,             
              the nerve cells form new connections with cells they do not                    
              normally communicate with.  The goal of Dr. Roberts research is to             
              develop anatomical techniques that will allow her to identify the              
              cells that form these new connections.  In addition, Dr. Roberts               
              will determine the chemical composition of these cells following               
              nerve cell loss.  These experiments which will characterize the                
              surviving nerve cells, will provide clues as to the functional                 
              impact of these changes and may begin to explain the elements                  
              necessary for repair and recovery in the brain after the injury.
