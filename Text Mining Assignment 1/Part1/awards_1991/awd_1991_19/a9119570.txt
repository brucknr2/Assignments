Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Force is developed in muscle contraction by myosin molecule pulling            
              actin filaments during shortening. The details of this process have            
              been difficult to establish because of the rapid and unsynchronized            
              nature of the many changes taking place during the relative sliding            
              of the filaments. Our work is focused on the structural changes                
              that are thought to be occurring in the head region of myosin                  
              during this interaction. The introduction of molecular biological              
              techniques in recent years has permitted us to modify the                      
              polypeptide structure of myosin in such a way that reporter groups             
              can be more readily introduced into the molecule. These groups can             
              be fluorescent probes for spectroscopic studies, or electron dense             
              probes for direct visualization by electron microscopy. These                  
              methods should provide new information about the dynamics of myosin            
              crossbridge movement during ATP hydrolysis and actin binding, both             
              in individual molecules and in muscle fibers during muscle                     
              contraction.
