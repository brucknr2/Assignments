Abstract    :
              This summer conference is concerned with the role of protein                   
              phosphatases in the regulation of cellular processes.  The areas of            
              cellular events that are covered are: nuclear proteins and                     
              transcription factors, receptors and ion channels, growth                      
              regulation, tumor promoters, toxins, and phosphatase inhibitors,               
              hormone action, and cell signalling.  The participants are the                 
              experts in their areas of expertise.  This meeting is international            
              in scope and is held biannually.

              The FASEB summer conference on (Phosopho)protein Phosphatases will             
              bring together an outstanding group of researchers involved in                 
              biochemical, genetic, and cell biology disciplines.  There should              
              be numerous opportunities for interactions and collaborations that             
              will accelerate progress in elucidating the role of PPt's in                   
              regulatory events.
