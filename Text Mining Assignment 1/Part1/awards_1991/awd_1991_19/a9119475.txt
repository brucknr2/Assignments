Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant is to support research in theoretical astrophysics by               
              one of the leading and most productive research groups in the                  
              world.  Studies will range from the generation of gravitational                
              waves to the existence of naked singularities in general                       
              relativity and from galaxy clusters to neutron stars and black                 
              holes.  Both analytical studies and numerical modeling on                      
              supercomputers will be used to extend our understanding of the                 
              dynamics and evolution of complex gravitational systems.
