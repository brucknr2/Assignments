Abstract    :
              9119254  Goodman       This grant is for construction and operation of the
              MILAGRO  air-shower detector that will be used to detect cosmic-ray  showers at
              energies between 100 GeV and 1000 TeV.  The instrument  is an innovative
              application of Cerenkov radiation produced in a  pool of water 5000 square
              meters in area by 8 meters deep.  It  will be sensitive to cosmic-rays that
              arrive at any time from any  direction above the detector.  Its angular
              resolution will be  sufficient to identify sources as yet undiscovered.  The
              grant  funds collaborative activities of four university-based groups.  ***
