Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Growth and development in plants is a complex process wherein                  
              environmental and physical factors interact substantially with the             
              genotype to determine the actual form of a plant in a particular               
              environment.  Apical dominance (correlative inhibition and control             
              of lateral branching) is a hormonally regulated process whereby a              
              growing shoot apical meristem controls the development and growth              
              of axillary buds, and thus has a major impact on the shape a plant             
              attains. The research proposed herein utilizes modern genetic                  
              methods to identify, characterize and clone genes which are                    
              responsible for the phenotypic expression of decreased apical                  
              dominance (increased branching) in Petunia hybrida.  A study of the            
              genes which control apical dominance will provide insight into the             
              mechanisms underlying correlative inhibition.  The knowledge                   
              provided by this research will further the understanding of the                
              molecular and physiological processes controlled by these genes.               
              In the long term the intent is to use this knowledge and genetic               
              materials to investigate the biochemistry and physiology of                    
              correlative inhibition.
