Abstract    :
              A group of researchers at the University of Louisville requests                
              funding for half of the cost of a circular dichroism spectrometer,             
              which will be used for assessing peptide and protein secondary                 
              structure in solution, for investigating changes in protein                    
              conformation induced by alterations in temperature, solvent, pH, or            
              ligand binding, and for conformational analysis of synthetic                   
              polypeptides and recombinant proteins.  The specific projects                  
              proposed include application of circular dichroism to the following            
              systems:  (1) purified, soluble cytochrome P-450 isozymes, and the             
              membrane anchoring peptide of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, (2)            
              cytoplasmic and microsomal enzymes involved in the metabolism of               
              foreign compounds, (3) recombinant human fibroblast procollagenase             
              and collagenase, (4) native RNA processing enzymes and recombinant             
              enzymes altered by site-directed mutagenesis, (5) mitochondrial                
              targeting signal peptides, (6) Ca++ -induced conformational changes            
              in chromogranin A, and (7) synthetic peptides containing amide bond            
              replacements (pseudopeptides).
