Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A wildfire that consumed more than 2000 ha of tallgrass prairie on             
              Konza Prairie Research Natural Area created a unique opportunity               
              to establish the relationship between methane, nitrous oxide, and              
              carbon dioxide fluxes and net primary productivity (NPP).  The fire            
              left a matrix of watersheds with various fire histories.  These                
              watershed also vary in soil carbon and nitrogen amounts, factors               
              which strongly influence trace gas flux and NPP.  Watershed level              
              differences in other constraints to NPP (water and light                       
              limitations) have been minimized by removal of litter.  By                     
              concurrently obtaining trace gas flux measurements, ground                     
              measurements of foliage biomass, and satellite images, Drs. Rice,              
              Seastedt, Tate, Turner and Benning propose to establish the                    
              relationship between methane flux, nitrous oxide flux and NPP in               
              temperate semi-humid grasslands.  Research conducted at the Konza              
              Prairie is at the leading edge of grassland studies and the                    
              facilities available to these investigators are outstanding.
