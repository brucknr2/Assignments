Abstract    :
                   The principle investigator will continue his research on                  
              problems involving the interaction between combinatorics and                   
              algebra.  He will focus on two problems.  The first concerns new               
              conjectures arising from the principle investigator's application              
              of Kazhdan-Lusztig theory to a problem on combinatorial immanants              
              which assert that certain Hecke algebra virtual characters are                 
              polynomials with with non-negative, even unimodal, integer                     
              coefficients.  A combinatorial approach to these conjectures will              
              be sought, along with combinatorial interpretations of known                   
              non-negativity results in Kazhdan-Lusztig theory which now rest                
              on difficult geometric machinery.  The second problem concerns                 
              the conjecture that the Shur function expansion of Macdonald's                 
              symmetric functions are polynomials with non-negative integer                  
              coefficients.                                                                  
                   This project is on the interface between combinatorics and                
              Lie algebra.  The principle investigator is concerned with                     
              certain polynomials which are combinatorially defined and have                 
              deep connections with structures in geometry and representation                
              theory.  This work is important both in mathematics and physics.
