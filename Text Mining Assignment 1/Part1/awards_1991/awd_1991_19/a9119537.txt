Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of this project is to determine the response of the              
              Baikal hydrological system to forcing from past changes in climate             
              and neotectonics.  Nine specific time windows of global importance             
              are targeted in a 3-year program of iterative steps.  The research             
              is designed to study these time windows by obtaining and analyzing             
              cores of Lake Baikal's sedimentary archive with a lithochrono-                 
              stratigraphic framework constrained by AMS 14C dating, magnetic                
              stratigraphy and high resolution 3.5 kKz seismic stratigraphy.                 
              The Lake Baikal paleolimnology project offers unique opportunities             
              as a full-scale American Russian scientific partnership.  Knowledge            
              about the response of the world's largest and deepest freshwater               
              body to continental climate change and atmospheric forcing will                
              contribute significant new results to international efforts to                 
              understand the past response dynamics of large ecosystems during               
              important time windows.  The project is guided as closely as                   
              possible by recommendations of the PAGES International                         
              Geosphere/Biosphere project, and climate and hydrological aspects              
              of Earth Systems history for the U.S. Global Change Program.
