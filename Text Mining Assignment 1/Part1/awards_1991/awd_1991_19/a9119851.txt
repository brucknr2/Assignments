Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of photoelectrochemistry.  During                
              the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Bard and             
              his students will pursue fundamental investigations of                         
              electrochemical and photoelectrochemical reactions at the                      
              semiconductor/liquid interface.  Three specific                                
              photoelectrochemical research thrusts will be pursued, namely (1)              
              the preparation, characterization, and study of quantum particles              
              and films of cadmium (II) and iron (IV) sulfides; (2) studies of               
              the influence of semiconductor surface structure on                            
              photoelectrochemical efficiency using scanning tunneling                       
              microscopy and tunneling spectroscopy techniques; and (3)                      
              preparation of new semiconductor materials by photodeposition of               
              metals on semiconductor single crystal, polycrystalline film, and              
              particle surfaces and by chemical vapor deposition and homogeneous             
              synthetic routes.                                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              This research builds upon results obtained under Dr. Bard's                    
              previous NSF grant, CHE-8805865.  In addition to providing                     
              fundamental insights into the processes that occur at the                      
              semiconductor/liquid interface, this research is of particular                 
              interest in the application of semiconductor-based systems for the             
              utilization of solar energy in such areas as the production of                 
              useful chemicals and the destruction of wastes.
