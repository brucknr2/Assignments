Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The recently completed  X-ray all-sky survey carried out by the                
              ROSAT satellite can provide a sample of clusters of galaxies which             
              has both well established quantifiable selection criteria and is               
              in a contiguous region of the sky.  To obtain this sample it is                
              necessary to identify the clusters from the more numerous other                
              sources.  The Principal Investigator is only one of a few US                   
              astronomers who were invited to participate in the ROSAT survey and            
              has access to this X-ray data well in advance of publication.  This            
              grant will provide support for follow-up optical studies of the                
              cluster sample with particular emphasis on the initial                         
              identification of the clusters and later investigations of                     
              evolution of X-ray and optical properties, large scale structure,              
              and the classical magnitude-redshift relation.  Analysis of the                
              ROSAT data will enable significant improvements over previous                  
              studies to be made.
