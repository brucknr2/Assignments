Abstract    :
              With funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                      
              metallic Program, Professor Donald Darensbourg of Texas A&M                    
              University plans studies of carbon dioxide-transition metal                    
              organometallic chemistry in five related area:  1) mechanism                   
              and scope of decarboxylation reactions of carboxylic acids, 2)                 
              reactivity of low valent metal alkoxides and aryloxides toward                 
              carbon dioxide insertion, 3) copolymerization of carbon dioxide                
              and epoxides, 4) carbon dioxide chemistry in aqueous solution                  
              employing soluble organometallic reagents, and 5) photochemical                
              activation of metal carbon bonds toward reaction with carbon                   
              dioxide.  In all cases emphasis is placed on the development of                
              a mechanistic understanding of the reactions involving carbon                  
              dioxide.  Techniques to be employed in these mechanistic                       
              studies include infrared spectroscopy under high temperatures                  
              and pressures using a cylindrical internal reflectance cell,                   
              and NMR spectroscopy.                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              Studies of the mechanisms of reaction of carbon dioxide with                   
              various organometallic reagents will be undertaken with the                    
              ultimate aim of developing methods of utilizing carbon dioxide                 
              as a carbon source for the production of consumer products.                    
              This is especially pertinent to current concerns of reducing                   
              the emissions of greenhouse gases, of which carbon dioxide                     
              constitutes more than 50%, in an economically feasible fashion.
