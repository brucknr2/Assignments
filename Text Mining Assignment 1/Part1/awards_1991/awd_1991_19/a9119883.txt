Abstract    :
                   The inland Australian desert is one of the last remaining                 
              areas where natural wildfires remain a regular and dominant                    
              feature of an extensive, largely undisturbed, natural landscape.               
              A fire succession cycle generates spatial and temporal                         
              heterogeneity.  Habitat-specialized species can go extinct within              
              a given habitat patch (fire scar), but remain in the overall                   
              system by periodic reinvasions from adjacent or nearby patches of              
              suitable habitat of different age.  Such regional processes and                
              thus the system-wide spatial and temporal al pattern of fire                   
              disturbance, facilitate local diversity.  The project will                     
              develop and test a hierarchical Markov chain model of fire                     
              succession.  The ultimate goal is to model the entire Great                    
              Victoria desert region as a dynamic habitat mosaic and to                      
              understand both the mechanisms of coexistence of its component                 
              species and the effects of fire disturbance in maintaining                     
              diversity.
