Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Some insect parasites inject secretions into the host along with               
              their egg which results in avoiding immune defenses and causes host            
              developmental arrest.  For Campoletis sonorensis, both phenomena               
              may be induced by a polydnavirus (PDV).  PDV is the only animal DNA            
              virus with a heterogeneous, segmented genome.  Several viral gene              
              families have been identified that are expressed during parasitism,            
              and viral gene expression is tissue and/or host specific.  Through             
              evolution the parasite has acquired to assemble, amplify and                   
              transfer this genetic information in a viral form to another                   
              eucaryotic host which is essential for parasite survival.                      
              We have shown one family of the venom related (VR) wasp and PDV                
              genes encode structural motifs that belong to "DEAD" protein                   
              family.  This suggests that these unique genes may encode products             
              involved in regulating, splicing or translation.  Our recent                   
              studies show also that CsPDV genes contain sequences that encode               
              a cysteine motif characteristic of peptide toxins.  The presence               
              of this motif is unlikely to be fortuitous,  rather it may reflect             
              a function as a ligand of cell surface receptors which may also be             
              correlated with functions related to parasite survival.  The                   
              significance of this study emphasizes the molecular basis of                   
              parasite induced avoidance of insect defense systems and the                   
              research conducted with NSF support will be directed to identifying            
              these expression products and determining their functional                     
              significance.
