Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The main objective of this proposal is to clarify the ecological               
              conditions in East Africa at the time our early ancestors were                 
              evolving.  Suids (pigs) are very well represented in the fossil                
              record of the area and are sensitive to ecological changes.  The PI            
              will construct a temporally controlled history of suid taxonomic               
              diversity and relate it to ecological change.  In this manner the              
              research may help to clarify the conditions under which our species            
              evolved.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              In addition, pigs are the only East African large-bodied, dietary              
              generalists other than hominids.  Thirdly, the species diversity of            
              suids and hominids are approximately parallel over this time                   
              period.  Thus the reconstruction of suid evolution will provide                
              information on several aspects of hominid evolution.
