Abstract    :
              This project is for the development of the initial prototype of one            
              of the nodes of an optoelectronic interconnection network                      
              ultimately capable of reaching terabyte-per-second capacities.                 
              Such a network is a crucial component in a future teraflop,                    
              distributed processing system.  The required capacity is reachable             
              through innovations in architecture, further development of a few              
              devices that have been demonstrated, and careful systems                       
              integration.  This project describes the first stage in the                    
              development of a single-word transmission, multiply-connected                  
              network, ultimately capable of delivering and extracting a                     
              sustained average rate of a few 10s of Gb/s from many 100s of                  
              electronic hosts simultaneously.  The electronic hosts would be at             
              multiway low-latency optical switching nodes separated by a few                
              meters to 10s of kilometers.  The techniques to be used are a hot-             
              potato self-routing protocol with no opto-electronic conversion,               
              a minimum-depth and physically flexible topology, optical packet               
              compression by optical wavelength and microwave subcarrier-                    
              division multiplexing per word, optical amplification,                         
              multiwavelength optical switching, and multitechnology opto-                   
              electronic integration and packaging.  The principal innovation is             
              to architect and engineer a system that exploits these strengths               
              simultaneously.  A large multi-year project will be staged as a                
              series of mutually dependent, increasingly sophisticated system                
              demonstrations and device development efforts.  This project will              
              construct the first rudimentary demonstration of the node in a few             
              months with (nearly) off-the-shelf components.
