Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This new hot press will to be used to fabricate ceramic samples                
              with microdesigned interfacial defect structures.  The hot press is            
              capable of reaching a temperature of at least 1600 C, at pressures             
              as low as 10_3-10-4, at a rate of about 1-2 C/min.  It would be                
              housed in the Ceramics Research Laboratory, within the Department              
              of Materials Science and Mineral Engineering.  The research                    
              programs most affected involve a method of combining photolitho-               
              graphic techniques with ion beam etching and hot pressing to                   
              produce microdesigned interface structures.  The method allows                 
              model experiments investigating high-temperature crack healing,                
              pore boundary interaciton, pore drag, pore coarsening, and pore                
              elimination and network evolution during sintering.  Examples                  
              of projects underway by faculty members include applications of                
              microdesigned interfaces to crack healing studies and pore-boundary            
              interactions in ceramic materials, ceramic-ceramic joining,                    
              ceramic-metal interface studies, whose research projects include               
              sintering studies.  Collaborative research topics with scientists              
              at other universities and industry include fracture behavior of                
              ceramic-metal interfaces, creep cavitation, segregation to internal            
              cavity surfaces, vapor phase growth of single crystal whiskers, and            
              NDE.  About 12 graduate students are working with the faculty                  
              members directly and several undergraduates.
