Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Current theory suggests that ecosystem stability is a function of              
              physical and biological complexity.  Frequent disturbances may                 
              reduce this complexity and thereby destabilize ecosystems, making              
              them more susceptible to future perturbations.  Theory predicts                
              that ecosystems with large scale physical (i.e. geomorphic)                    
              complexity can effectively maintain structural integrity when                  
              impacted by catastrophic disturbances.  This project will develop              
              a quantitative model that links changes in ecosystem structural                
              complexity resulting from disturbances, to stability.  Because                 
              streams are strongly influenced by landscape geomorphology and                 
              respond relatively quickly to disturbances, stream ecosystems                  
              will be used.  Disturbance-stability relationships will be                     
              assessed in terms of logging impacts, landslides, and floods on                
              general stream ecosystem dynamics, with special emphasis on fish               
              population responses.  To address the importance of large and                  
              small scale physical complexity, the model will be hierarchically              
              structured (i.e. contain basin, stream reach, and channel unit                 
              scales), and focus on examination of logging impacts at the                    
              stream reach scale.  Hypotheses developed and evaluated with this              
              model should provide new insights into how geomorphic complexity               
              interacts with disturbance to structure ecosystems and set the                 
              stage for the success or failure of biotic components.
