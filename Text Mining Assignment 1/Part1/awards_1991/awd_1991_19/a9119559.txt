Abstract    :
              The proposed award is for the support of work over a three-year                
              period.  There has been little interest in the fate of hydro-                  
              carbon contaminants in cold regions.  There has been limited                   
              research on water movement in such frozen soils as permafrost.                 
              Research on contaminant transport under freezing conditions has                
              increased as interest in human activity in polar regions has                   
              increased.  The work has three components:  1) bench-scale                     
              studies of mechanisms affecting transport processes in ice and                 
              soil/ice systems; 2) field studies of two locations (one arctic,               
              the other antarctic) known to have experienced hydrocarbon                     
              contamination; and 3) development of a computer model to allow                 
              analysis and prediction of hydrocarbons in ice and ice/soil                    
              systems.  Spatial and temporal variation in soil matrices are                  
              important aspects of soil contaminant investigations.  Data                    
              collected in the physical bench-scale studies will serve as the                
              underlying support for equation development and documentation of               
              the  exclusion  phenomenon.  Also, they will provide specific                  
              information on the effects of percent clay and silt, and on                    
              exclusion coefficients for the three components of the                         
              contaminant mixture (i.e., benzene,toluene and xylene).  Field                 
              study data will serve to calibrate and validate a transport                    
              model.  The research will extend current work being done by the                
              Principal Investigators on modelling of hydrocarbon-groundwater                
              interactions under freezing conditions.
