Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal combines the experimental and theoretical efforts of             
              one ceramist, one chemist, and one applied mathematician, to seek              
              a fundamental understanding of the basis of phase stability of                 
              zirconia and fluorite related materials; and the origin of fatigue             
              behavior and the development of appropriate constitutive                       
              relationships of transformation toughened ceramics.  EXAFS and                 
              XANES techniques will be used to coordinate with the mechanical                
              properties of zirconia polymorphs.  Analytical and computational               
              modelling will be complemented by deformation and fracture                     
              experiments, under monotonic, cyclic, high strain rate, and high               
              pressure loading conditions.                                                   
              %%%%                                                                           
              This research promises to provide new insights to the                          
              micromodelling of transformation toughening of zirconia ceramics.              
              It starts from the viewpoint of shear-dilatant plasticity.                     
              Information to be gained on phase stability of oxides is important             
              not only for zirconia ceramics, but also to other oxide systems as             
              well.
