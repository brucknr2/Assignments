Abstract    :
              This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                        
              metallic program is to support the investigation of poly-                      
              nuclear transition metal oxoalkoxide complexes.  The general                   
              focus is on compounds that may serve as soluble models for                     
              oxide surfaces, intermediates in alkoxide hydrolysis, and as                   
              precursors for sol-gel synthesis of new materials.  The metals                 
              of interest are molybdenum and vanadium with possible                          
              extensions to tantalum and niobium; alkoxides will be chosen                   
              from among several polyfunctional hydroxylic compounds.  The                   
              broad objectives of the research are to gain insight into the                  
              fundamental aspects of aggregation and thereby the control of                  
              nuclearity of the polynuclear species.                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Metal oxides are among the most common and most useful metallic                
              compounds but are also among the most difficult to characterize                
              with respect to their mechanisms of formation and action in                    
              many catalytic reactions.  Many metal oxides are prepared by                   
              reaction of metal alkoxides (metal salts of alcohols) with                     
              water.  This research is designed to improve our understanding                 
              of both processes through the study of cluster molecules and                   
              ions that contain multiple metal atoms, and both oxide and                     
              alkoxide ligands.  The new compounds will be studied in                        
              solution and in the solid state by a variety of spectroscopic                  
              methods and solid state structures will be determined by x-ray                 
              crystallography.  Some of the compounds whose syntheses are                    
              proposed may be useful for the preparation of new ceramic                      
              materials and catalysts.
