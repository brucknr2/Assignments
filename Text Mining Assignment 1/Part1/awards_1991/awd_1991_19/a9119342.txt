Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal explores mixed-mode fracture in two aluminum alloys              
              and a titanium aluminide alloy.  Variations in microstructure allow            
              for analysis of the role of second phase precipitates and                      
              dispersoids on the fracture process.  Variables include particle               
              shape and volume fraction, temperature, and matrix condition.                  
              Mechanical behavior to be examined includes fracture toughness,                
              plane strain tension and compression behavior, and axisymmmetric               
              tensile flow.  Scanning and transmission electron microscopy are               
              used to characterize the microstructure.  Both theoretical and                 
              experimental approaches are outlined, the theory examining shear               
              bands in such materials.  The shear bands are represented by a tilt            
              wall dislocation array, a portion of which can breakaway and                   
              propagate, interacting with dispersed particles in the vicinity.

              The fracture of structural metal alloys is important to a wide                 
              variety of applications.  This research advances our understanding             
              of crack propagation in complex alloys and should provide avenues              
              of applied research that will lead to improvement of mechanical                
              properties of structural materials.
