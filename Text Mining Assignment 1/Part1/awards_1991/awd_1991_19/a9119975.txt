Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Learning and memory requires specific chemical modifications of                
              neuronal structure and interactions between the neurons in the                 
              nervous system.  There are a number of chemical substances in                  
              cells, such as calmodulin that phosphorylate specific enzymes                  
              responsible for the chemical modifications.  Another of these                  
              important substances recently discovered and found only in nerve               
              is a compound called neurogranin.  Like calmodulin and the                     
              associated calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II,                     
              neurogranin may regulate the availability of active calmodulin in              
              nerve cells.  In order to better understand the processes                      
              associated with learning and memory the location of neurogranin                
              within the neuron, how it gets to its site of action from the                  
              site of its synthesis and how neurogranin regulates the                        
              availability of calmodulin must be determined.
