Abstract    :
                   This Research Opportunity Award funds a primarily hispanic                
              university, California State University, Los Angeles, for a project            
              augmenting the research program of Eastern Michigan University's               
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Coatings                   
              Research.  The two year project entitled "Surface Roughness Effects            
              on Adhesion of Polymer Coatings to Metal Substrates" will employ               
              a blister test to measure the bonding energy between coatings and              
              metallic substrate.                                                            
                   The researchers will report their results to the Center's                 
              Industry Advisory Board at Eastern Michigan University.                        
                   This project is coordinated with and cost-shared by the                   
              Division of Engineering Infrastructure Development.                            
                   The Program Manager recommends that California State                      
              University, Los Angeles be awarded $100,000 for a two-year Research            
              Opportunity Award.
