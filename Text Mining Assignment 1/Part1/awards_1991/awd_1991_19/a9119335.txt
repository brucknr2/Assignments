Abstract    :
                This grant supports one-half of the inside-U.S. expenses for                 
              hosting Mr. Li Songlin of China's State Seismological Bureau                   
              under the U.S./PRC Protocol for Earthquake Studies.  The State                 
              Seismological Bureau, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the                      
              National Science Foundation are the members of the Protocol.                   
              This support is important to the successful conduct of U.S.                    
              projects mapping seismogenic structures now underway in the PRC                
              by Dr. Mooney of the USGS and Dr. McEvilly of U.C. Berkeley.                   
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                 
              Reduction Program.
