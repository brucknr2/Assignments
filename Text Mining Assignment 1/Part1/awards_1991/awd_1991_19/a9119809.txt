Abstract    :
                   Frankia are N2-fixing, sporulating, gram positive,                        
              filamentous bacteria (Actinomycetales) capable of forming root                 
              nodules on a variety of predominantly woody perennial plants,                  
              including Alnus and Ceanothus.  These actinorhizal associations                
              contribute significant quantities of nitrogen (50-150 Kg N ha-1                
              ya-1) to temperate forest ecosystems.  In addition to enhancing                
              forest productivity via nitrogen fixation, some actinorhizal                   
              plants, such as Alnus rubra in the Pacific Northwest, are                      
              important timber resources.  Ecological studies of Frankia in                  
              soil are in their infancy, primarily because of the difficulty of              
              isolating Frankia from soil and of differentiating Frankia                     
              strains from each other and from other soil microorganisms.  No                
              Frankia have been isolated from Ceanothus, a plant important to                
              forest productivity in Oregon.  Even alder, from which the                     
              majority of strains have been isolated, harbors many strains                   
              which cannot be cultured at this time.                                         
                   In order to assess the diversity of Frankia in soil, it is                
              necessary to develop efficient methods of DNA extraction and a                 
              means of distinguishing among Frankia strains.  This research                  
              will quantify and potentially improve soil DNA extraction                      
              efficiency.  It will also develop a means of differentiating                   
              among Alnus-infective Frankia strains based on differences in the              
              DNA sequence of rrn gene.
