Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah                
              acquire a Raman spectrometer.  The Raman spectrometer will be                  
              used in research projects aimed at:  1)  Raman studies of                      
              metalloproteins, 2)  chemical structure and kinetics at                        
              dielectric solid/liquid interfaces, 4) vibrational studies of                  
              complex Ni(III) and Ni(IV) oxides, 5) vibrational studies of                   
              host-guest interactions in organometallic systems and 6) Raman                 
              spectroscopic studies of solid state chain reactions.                          
                                                                                             
              Raman spectroscopy is concerned with vibrational and rotational                
              transitions in molecules.  The information obtained sometimes                  
              complements that obtained from an infrared study and provides                  
              valuable structural information.  Fourier-transform Raman                      
              spectroscopy with near-infrared excitation provides a powerful                 
              solution to problems of high background fluorescene or sample                  
              photodegradation, as well as enhanced signal-to-noise quality.                 
              Raman spectroscopy is an invaluable tool in studies of                         
              condensed-phase chemical and biomolecular systems.
