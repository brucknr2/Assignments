Abstract    :
              Spin-dependent elastic and inelastic electron scattering will be               
              used to study the magnetism at surfaces and in ultra-thin films.               
              The spin-dependence of inelastic scattering in localized magnetic              
              moment systems (3d transition metal oxides and rare earth                      
              materials) will be studied by spin polarized electron energy loss              
              spectroscopy.  The energy resolution will be improved by employing             
              a new spin detector in order to reach the energy range of                      
              collective magnetic excitations.  The spin-dependent attenuation of            
              electron through ultra-thin ferromagnetic overlayers will be                   
              studied by spin polarized photoemission spectroscopy.  The                     
              structure and magnetization for ultra-thin films will be studied by            
              combining quantitative LEED and SPLEED analysis and polarized                  
              secondary emission spectroscopy on ultra-thin films.  Spin                     
              polarized LEED measurements will be compared to state-of-the-art               
              theoretical calculations, thereby allowing a simultaneous                      
              investigation of the geometric and magnetic structure of the films.
