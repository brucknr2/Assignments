Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is concerned with the formation of noncentrosymmetric            
              materials with ferroelectric properties.  These materials are based            
              on a new class of liquid crystalline compounds which have pyramidic            
              transition metal complexes as core group.  The orientation of these            
              materials by the application of electric field will be explored as             
              a route to noncentrosymmetric solids with a macroscopic electrical             
              polarization.  The materials are ferroelectrics if polarization                
              persists after electric field is removed.  Because polarization is             
              sensitive to pressure and temperature, ferroelectrics possess                  
              piezoelectric and proelectric properties.  Mechanism for                       
              polarization reversal, and experiments for their elucidation are               
              proposed.  Also, methods are proposed for the formation of electro-            
              responsive polymers that exhibit large field-induced deformation.              
              The ultimate aim is to develop field-and pressure-responsive                   
              conductors.
