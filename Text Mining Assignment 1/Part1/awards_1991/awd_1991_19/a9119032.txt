Abstract    :
                 Geographic research has been extremely dynamic in recent decades,           
              making the quadrennial congresses sponsored by the International               
              Geographical Union (IGU) extremely important settings at which                 
              geographers and scholars in related disciplines meet to exchange the           
              most recent results of their research and to plan future collaborative         
              activities.  The 27th Congress of the IGU will be held in Washington,          
              D.C., in August 1992, providing an excellent opportunity for American          
              geographers to meet directly with colleagues from other parts of the           
              world.  This award provides support for the 27th International                 
              Geographical Congress (IGC) in two ways.  First, it provides financial         
              assistance from NSF to offset costs of planning and operating the              
              congress.  Second, it provides a means through which other federal             
              governmental agencies may provide financial support through interagency        
              agreements that will fund supplements to the initial award.  This award        
              is effectively a renewal of NSF Award SES-9000186, but it is made as a         
              new award because financial responsibility for administration of the           
              award now will be handled directly by the Organizing Committee of the          
              27th IGC.                                                                      
                 This award will provide valuable financial assistance for the               
              planning and operation of the largest and most significant gathering of        
              geographers from throughout the world.  As has been true with past IGU         
              activities, enhanced scholarship and increased involvement in                  
              international collaborative activities by American geographers will            
              result.  Further positive consequences of this grant will be realized if       
              NSF can assist in channelling contributions from other federal agencies        
              to this important activity.
