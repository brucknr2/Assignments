Abstract    :
                   This project will test the fundamental underpinnings of the               
              standard theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) by measuring                  
              decay rates and the properties of the excited states of                        
              positronium, a "molecule" consisting of one electron and one                   
              positron (positively charged electron).  A related experiment                  
              will center on a test of time reversal invariance, one of the                  
              fundamental symmetries thought to be found in nature.
