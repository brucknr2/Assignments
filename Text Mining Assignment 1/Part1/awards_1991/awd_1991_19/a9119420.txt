Abstract    :
                   This project will provide a wide-ranging and detailed                     
              investigation of cellular automata (CA) models as descriptions of              
              ecological interactions in space and time.  CA models are                      
              essentially discretized versions of reaction-diffusion models; they            
              are closely related to patch-occupancy models for metapopulation               
              dynamics.  The research program will construct models for                      
              competition, predation, and predator-mediated coexistence.  It will            
              extend the usual CA approaches to include substrate heterogeneity              
              and disturbance size distributions.  The analysis of these models              
              will include a range of non-spatial or mean-field properties (state            
              and species frequencies, mean alpha and beta diversities,                      
              interspecific associations, and turnover rates) as well as                     
              explicitly spatial methods (fractal dimensions, other scaling                  
              relationships, and wavelet analysis).  The models will be applied              
              to a number of specific problems, including the relationship of                
              biotic and substrate heterogeneity, the contrast of CA models with             
              the corresponding spatially averaged patch-occupancy models, and               
              the conditions required for pattern generation in the ecological               
              analogs of excitable media.  This research will provide new                    
              insights into spatial relationships of many basic processes in                 
              population and community ecology.
