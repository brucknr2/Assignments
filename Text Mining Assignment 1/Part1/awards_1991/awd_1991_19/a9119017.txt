Abstract    :
                   As part of a number of efforts to elucidate how deformation               
              is distributed across the North-American/Pacific plate boundary in             
              California, the PI will continue GPS surveys in the Continental                
              Borderland region, offshore of southern California.  Such surveys              
              have been conducted since 1986 by a consortium of four                         
              universities, including UCSD.  A variety of evidence suggests that             
              there is currently deformation in this region, with perhaps 20% of             
              the total plate-boundary motion occurring there.  The surveys so               
              far made have given a number of tentative results for this region,             
              but have raised new questions as well.  The span of these surveys              
              (5 years) has not been sufficient to unequivocally determine the               
              deformation patterns.  This project will double the time span of               
              observations; given the improvements in the satellite constellation            
              and tracking networks that have taken place in the last few years,             
              this should do better than halve the errors.  Since a major reason             
              for making these measurements at all is to understand completely               
              the budget of plate motion across this boundary, the needs to make             
              the errors smaller than the remaining unknown amounts of motion.               
              This not yet true, but should be when these measurements are                   
              complete.
