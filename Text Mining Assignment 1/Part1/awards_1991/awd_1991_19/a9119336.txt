Abstract    :
              The mechanics of accretionary wedge growth along deep sea                      
              trenches is a fundamental problem in  plate tectonics. Although                
              models exist which predict seafloor shape, sparse information                  
              exists on the geometry of deformation structures, strength of the              
              accreting sediments, or shear resistance along the base of the                 
              fault zone which controls underthrusting. It is well recognized                
              that fluids play a crucial role in sediment accretion,                         
              deformation, diagenesis, and metamorphism in accretionary zones,               
              but study of fluid pathways and timing of dewatering have just                 
              begun. The importance of fluids in controlling the strength of                 
              rocks and shear resistance is recognized, but little data exists               
              to investigate these properties spatially or temporally.                       
                                                                                             
              The present project will conduct a high-resolution three-                      
              dimensional seismic reflection survey of the accretionary prism                
              offshore Barbados in the zone of initial off-scraping,                         
              underplating and deformation of sediments. The objectives are to               
              characterize the structural geometries, and identify fluid                     
              pathways in the frontal part of the accretionary prism. The                    
              seismic data will be constrained by an extensive suite of other                
              geophysical data, as well as the results of previous ocean                     
              drilling in the region. Results from this project will be used in              
              planning additional drilling in Barbados.
