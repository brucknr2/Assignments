Abstract    :
              Current real-time systems have typically been designed under                   
              the assumption that characteristics of the workload and the                    
              computing environment are both well-known and well-specified                   
              at the time of system design.  Future real-time systems,                       
              however, will be required to operate in a more uncertain and                   
              stochastic environment.  As a result, the designers of these                   
              future systems face a much more difficult task in developing                   
              resource scheduling algorithms and formally establishing their                 
              performance, timing, and fault-tolerance properties.                           
                                                                                             
              This project is concerned with the design and performance                      
              evaluation of scheduling algorithms for real-time systems                      
              operating in a stochastic environment.  The specific focus is                  
              on developing rigorous and formal approaches towards analyzing                 
              and designing such systems in a wide range of settings                         
              including uniprocessor, multiprocessor and fault-tolerant                      
              environments.
