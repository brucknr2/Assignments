Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              New methods hold the promise for providing answers to previously               
              intractable problems in microbial ecology.  This project will                  
              develop new technologies needed to determine where nitrification               
              occurs in acidic forest soils: (a) polymerase chain reaction                   
              (PCR) to quantify nitrifier populations in small soil samples                  
              using primers based on the ammonium monooxygenase chromosomal                  
              gene and regions of 16S ribosomal DNA specific to ammonia-                     
              oxidizing strains and (b) microelectrodes to measure pH gradients              
              in the soil.  Autotrophic nitrification may occur in alkaline                  
              microenvironments within an acid forest soil developed under red               
              alder (Alnus rubra).  Microgradients of pH and populations of                  
              nitrifiers (by PCR) will be determined.  Methods developed will                
              be applicable to improvements in forestry and agricultural                     
              practices as well as to the fundamental study of nutrient                      
              dynamics in soils.
