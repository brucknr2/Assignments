Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This basic research project utilizes the capabilities unique to                
              thermal atomic beam scattering(ABS)--high sensitivity to low                   
              coverage impurities and defects, real time measurement--to obtain              
              detailed structural information for complex surface ordered                    
              phases without surface damage or charging effects allowing the                 
              study of kinetic, dynamical and structural properties of epitaxy.              
              The research combines the ABS technique with other advanced                    
              surface science diagnostic methods to characterize both the                    
              growth mode, and the structural and chemical details of epitaxial              
              crystal growth, layer by layer.                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental                        
              understanding of epitaxial crystal growth at the atomic level.                 
              From an application point of view, understanding the details of                
              crystal growth at this level is particularly helpful to advanced               
              semiconductor device design and fabrication.  The results will be              
              of importance in a general way to the technology of large scale,               
              high speed integrated electronic circuits.
