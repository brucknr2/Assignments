Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is now well established that much of the Universe is composed               
              of nonluminous matter, but there is little or no evidence for what             
              this material might be.  Certain galaxies (dwarf spheroidal                    
              galaxies) are the most local external systems thought to contain               
              dark matter, and are the simplest type of galaxy.  They contain                
              little or no gas and have had relatively simple star formation                 
              histories.  Careful kinematic studies of these galaxies may provide            
              the least ambiguous evidence for the nature of dark matter.                    
                                                                                             
              The research to be supported by this grant will measure precise                
              velocities of stars in three dwarf spheroidal galaxies in order to             
              measure the velocity dispersion of the stars in these systems.  The            
              acquisition of precise velocities in each of these systems will                
              allow the gravitational potential of these galaxies to be measured.            
              The precise structure of these galaxies is rather poorly known, and            
              photometry will be obtained which will substantially improve our               
              knowledge of the structure of these low luminosity galaxies.
