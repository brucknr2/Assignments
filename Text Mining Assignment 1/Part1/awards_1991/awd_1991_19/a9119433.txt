Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to estimate the numerical                    
              convergence rate of three key climate elements of hydrological and             
              energy cycles, and to thereby quantify the error of numerical                  
              approximations at different resolutions.  The three elements are:              
              i)vertical fluxes of water vapor between the atmosphere and ocean,             
              ii) horizontal fluxes of water vapor in boundary layer jets, and               
              iii) sensitivity of fractional cloud cover to model resolution.                
              The methodology will be to use a telescoping, variable resolution              
              global model that is capable of locally resolving far more                     
              structure than are other uniform resolution climate models.  The               
              vertical boundary layer resolution will be selectively enhanced to             
              study item (i) and the horizontal resolution will be locally                   
              enhanced to explicitly resolve mesoscale structures to study items             
              (ii) and (iii).                                                                
                 The study is important because it seeks to better understand                
              water vapor transports between the oceans and atmosphere, a key                
              component of the global water cycle.  This research is supported               
              partially by the Global Change Global Energy and Water Cycle                   
              Experiment (GEWEX).
