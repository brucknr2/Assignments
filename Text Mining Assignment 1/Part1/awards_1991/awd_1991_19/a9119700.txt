Abstract    :
              The principal investigator has proposed to employ a relational                 
              database for bacteriophage T4.  The T-even bacteriophages have                 
              been a key model system in the development of molecular biology,               
              from the original demonstrations that DNA is the genetic material              
              and that it functions through an mRNA intermediary to studies of               
              protein assembly and discovery of the first prokaryotic introns.               
              Now, the ability to analyze and interrelate vast quantities of                 
              data is becoming an increasingly important aspect of genetic                   
              research, and a number of aspects of T4 again make it highly                   
              qualified as a model system for testing and initial                            
              implementation of the complex relational databases being                       
              developed for this purpose.  The investigator will place much of               
              the current data on T4 (e.g. sequence data, 2-d protein maps)                  
              into a relational database, working together with both the broad,              
              closely-knit T4 community and with researchers at NCBI and JIPID               
              who are working intensely on database development.  The principal              
              investigator will continue to work to integrate new data, resolve              
              discrepancies and make the database available to all interested                
              parties through electronic network FTP.
