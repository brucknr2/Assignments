Abstract    :
              With funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                     
              metallic Chemistry Program, Professor Teddy G. Traylor of the                  
              University of California, San Diego will continue his studies                  
              on the mechanisms of oxidation reactions catalyzed by                          
              iron-porphyrin complexes.  These reactions are models for                      
              biological iron-porphyrin based oxidations but may also be                     
              useful for laboratory or even industrial oxidations.  The                      
              design and preparation of new catalysts and detailed studies of                
              the individual steps involved in catalyzed epoxidation of                      
              alkenes, hydroxylation of alkanes, oxidations of arenes and of                 
              phenols will be undertaken in this grant period.  Also to be                   
              considered are the utilization of dioxygen as the oxygen source                
              and the use of recently discovered halogenated porphyrin                       
              catalysts, and especially polymeric versions of these, for                     
              oxidation reactions.                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Oxidation reactions are fundamental to many biological and                     
              industrial processes.  The mechanisms of many of these                         
              reactions are still unknown and limit the ability of scientists                
              to design new oxidants and particularly catalysts for selective                
              oxidation of organic compounds.  The research to be performed                  
              here has as its objective the determination of the way in which                
              man-made mimics of biological oxidants react with various types                
              of organic molecules.  Recently discovered forms of the iron                   
              based compounds have unique reactivities that have been                        
              retained in very stable polymeric forms of the compounds.                      
              These polymeric catalysts show promise for preparative scale                   
              laboratory reactions and possibly small-scale industrial                       
              processes.
