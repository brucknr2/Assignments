Abstract    :
              This collaborative project between                                             
              workers at Berkeley and UCSF is                                                
              designed to produce new polymeric                                              
              peptides with useful properties.                                               
              The investigators are all excellent                                            
              scientists, although all well                                                  
              supported by other grants.  In                                                 
              particular Dr. Craik has another                                               
              NSF grant which duplicates his                                                 
              effort in this proposal.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The P.I. has developed enzymatic                                               
              methods for reacting amino acid                                                
              esters in organic solvents with                                                
              free amino acids to generate                                                   
              dipeptides.  The approach has been                                             
              extended to a tetra peptide, but                                               
              the strategy seems unlikely to                                                 
              produce useful polymers, although                                              
              it might be practical for short                                                
              peptides.  It should be noted that                                             
              carboxypeptidase cannot be employed                                            
              in such syntheses because it does                                              
              not have and acyl enzyme                                                       
              intermediate.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              There are some interesting ideas in                                            
              this proposal, but the practicality                                            
              of synthesizing polypeptides by                                                
              these approaches seems minimal.
