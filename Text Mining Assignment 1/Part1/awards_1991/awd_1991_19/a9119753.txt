Abstract    :
              This project will continue and expand the study of the upper                   
              atmosphere, especially auroral phenomena, using photometry and                 
              riometric techniques.  The PI has developed a new imaging riometer             
              (relative ionospheric opacity meter) system called IRIS (Imaging               
              Riometer for Ionospheric Studies).  The first two IRIS's were                  
              installed at South Pole Station and Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland.              
              A third IRIS will be installed at Iqiluit, NWT, Canada later this              
              year.  There are also broad-beam riometers operating at several                
              frequencies at South Pole, McMurdo and Iqiluit as well as auroral              
              photometers at South Pole and McMurdo.  Iqiluit is the magnetic                
              conjugate to South Pole.                                                       
                                                                                             
              These instruments constitute a unique network with which to study              
              auroral effects in both magnetic hemispheres simultaneously.  The              
              principal investigator is an internationally respected expert on               
              the effects of precipitating electrons on the atmosphere.
