Abstract    :
                    Middle Tennessee State University is establishing a connection           
              to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line through the SURANET                
              mid-level network. The connection enhances collaborations of campus            
              scientists with colleagues in fields including computer science and            
              psychology.  This award funds part of the costs for two years.
