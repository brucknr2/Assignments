Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this project is to learn more about the history            
              of the solar nebula by studying the chondrite meteorites.  During              
              the next two years the PIs will: examine new chondrite finds                   
              related to the Renazzo and Al Rais carbonaceous chondrites,                    
              continue study of the new CK group of carbonaceous chondrites,                 
              analyze some CI-like carbonaceous chondrites and search for other              
              seemingly exotic chondrites, return to the L/LL chondrites and                 
              search for evidence that will resolve the L/LL chondrites from the             
              LL group.  About 30 elements will be analyzed in the PI's lab using            
              high precision neutron activation analysis.  This should provide               
              important data which will contribute to a better understanding of              
              the formation of the solar system.
