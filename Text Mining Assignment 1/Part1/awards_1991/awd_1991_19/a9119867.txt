Abstract    :
                   Poeciliids (Pisces, Poeciliidae), the guppies, swordtails,                
              and mollies, are a family of small fishes that are frequently                  
              used as a model system in many biological studies. Research                    
              topics range from zoogeography, cancer, mating systems, natural                
              and sexual selection, comparative ecology, to conservation                     
              biology. Despite their widespread use, very little is known about              
              the phylogenetic or genealogical relationships of poeciliids. The              
              aim of this project by Dr. Axel Meyer at SUNY-Stonybrook is to                 
              establish such a phylogeny for the poeciliids using mitochondrial              
              and nuclear DNA sequence data as measures of mutational                        
              differences between species.                                                   
                   The complete sequence of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b              
              (about 1100 base pairs) and partial sequences of a nuclear gene,               
              the proto-oncogene X-src (about 520 base pairs), will be obtained              
              from several representatives of the species and genera in this                 
              family.  The use of both mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data               
              permits the inference of phylogenetic relationship across broad                
              taxonomic levels, from species to family, and also provides                    
              independent checking of the resulting phylogenetic estimates.                  
              These estimates will then permit testing of vicariance models of               
              biogeography and other aspects of evolutionary diversification in              
              this group of fishes.
