Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Southern University requests support from NSF for connection of                
              their campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel network              
              located in the southeastern United States.  It will provide                    
              operations management and information services and it will give                
              Southern University a 1.5 million bits per second connection to                
              the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)                    
              National Backbone network.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The University needs greater functionality and network speed to                
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to collaborate with peers at                   
              other schools on common projects.  Students and faculty research               
              will benefit from the link.  This is also a unique opportunity                 
              for the school to explore innovative educational resources.***//
