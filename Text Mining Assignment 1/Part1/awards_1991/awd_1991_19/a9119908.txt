Abstract    :
              The purpose of the proposed workshops will be to assess the state-             
              of-the-art in deformation process simulation and identify those                
              areas central to the improvement of simulation capabilities.                   
              Further, on objective of the workshops will be to strive to foster             
              joint activities to further advance the modeling of industrial                 
              forming processes and to bring state-of-the-art capabilities into              
              commercial usage.  The participants will be chosen from active                 
              researchers in the U.S. and France, as well as other countries such            
              as Germany, Canada, and the U.K.
