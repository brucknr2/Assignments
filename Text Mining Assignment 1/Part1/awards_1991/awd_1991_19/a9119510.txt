Abstract    :
              The application of surface vibrational spectroscopy to the                     
              study of adsorbates on electrode surfaces is the focus of this                 
              research project in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                       
              program.  Professor Weaver will examine both in situ                           
              electrochemical interfaces as well as electrode surfaces                       
              transferred into the UHV environment. Carbon monoxide will be                  
              used as a probe molecule to investigate the interactions of                    
              adsorbate and solvent molecules in model double layer                          
              electrochemical environments.  Surface reconstruction on gold                  
              and platinum group substrates will be examined, as well as its                 
              relation to electrochemical adsorption and reactivity.

              Spectroscopic studies of electrochemical interfaces will be                    
              carried out using a variety of model systems and approaches.                   
              An understanding of the structure and reactivity of the                        
              solid-solution interface will enable the design and                            
              optimization of electrochemical systems with important                         
              application in electrocatalysis, power generation and storage,                 
              and electrochemical synthesis.
