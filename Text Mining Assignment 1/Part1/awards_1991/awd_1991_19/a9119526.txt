Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop a transposon tagging system for                  
              Arabidopsis, based on the maize transposon Activator.                          
                                                                                             
              It is proposed that an Ac-derived tagging vector will be developed             
              based on the novel concept of a suicide Ac element.  Transposition             
              of suicide Ac will be limited to a single event in post-meiotic                
              pollen of a primary transformant, thus individual progeny of the               
              transformant will contain a single element at a unique genomic                 
              location.  This will allow easy assessment of distribution of                  
              element target sites.                                                          
                                                                                             
              If successful, the result would be a new and versatile tool with               
              which insertional mutations could readily be produced, analyzed and            
              cloned in Arabidopsis.
