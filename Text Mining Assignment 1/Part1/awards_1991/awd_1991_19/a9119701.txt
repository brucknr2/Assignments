Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The epitaxial relationships between a crystalline substrate and                
              adsorbed layers will be studied, viz. for fluid and solid                      
              monolayers on cleaved surfaces of magnesium oxide and graphite.                
              The techniques employed will be low-energy electron diffraction                
              (LEED) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).                                      
                                                                                             
                                       %  %  %                                               
                                                                                             
                 Physically-adsorbed layers on solid surfaces provide one of the             
              simplest model systems to study how the presence of an interface               
              affects the properties of materials at the interface.
