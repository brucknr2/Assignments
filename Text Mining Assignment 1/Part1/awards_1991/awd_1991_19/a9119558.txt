Abstract    :
                   This award will help support the Seminar on Stochastic                    
              Processes.  This seminar, now in its twelfth year, provides an                 
              opportunity for dissemination and discussion of research in the                
              areas of Markov processes, potential theory and stochastic                     
              analysis.                                                                      
                   The seminar is to be held at the University of Washington.                
              This award will provide partial travel support for women,                      
              minorities, recent Ph.D.s, and graduate students, who may not                  
              otherwise have been able to attend the conference.
