Abstract    :
              This research comprises the careful preparation, characterization              
              and investigation of artificially-structured materials and systems             
              with dimensions at the nanometer level, with particular emphasis on            
              surface, interface and thin film magnetism.  These new materials               
              are expected to possess specifically tailored electric and magnetic            
              properties.  They provide a sound basis for systematic studies to              
              explore basic concepts in fundamental physics such as phase                    
              transitions in two dimensions, enhanced ferromagnetism, altered                
              critical phenomena, magnetic coupling, proximity and interfacial               
              effects, magnetic surface and interface anisotropies.  Electron                
              capture spectroscopy and spin-polarized method will probe long                 
              range and short range magnetic order.  These new materials, which;             
              are also studied using scanning tunneling microscopy, will include             
              magnetic heterostructures with elements such as iron, colbalt,                 
              chromium, vanadium, palladium, terbium, and gadolinium that exhibit            
              unusual physical properties if deposited in selected substrates                
              and/or interfaced with suitable elements.These materials have                  
              potential application in technological areas such as thin film                 
              magnetic recording media and heads.
