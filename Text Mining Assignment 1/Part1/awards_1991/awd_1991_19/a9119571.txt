Abstract    :
              This grant provides the NSF support for a collaboration between                
              Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and British Antarctic                 
              Survey (BAS) to operate a High Frequency coherent scatter radar at             
              BAS's Halley Bay Station.  The radar is the southern component of              
              a pair of similar radars while the northern component is at Goose              
              Bay Labrador, which is located on the same geomagnetic field line              
              as Halley Bay.  Such a pair is said to be "magnetically conjugate".            
              The array is called PACE (Polar Anglo-American Conjugate                       
              Experiment).  In addition, the Halley Bay radar has a field of view            
              which includes the ionosphere above the well instrumented USAP                 
              South Pole Station.  Together the radars can map the density and               
              velocity of the ionospheric plasma in the polar caps of both                   
              hemispheres, providing unprecedented opportunities to study                    
              conjugate phenomena and how the Earth's high latitude ionosphere               
              responds to changes in the solar wind.                                         
                                                                                             
              This project is an important contribution to the International                 
              Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP), Global Geospace Modelling (GEM)              
              and Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics through Atmospheric Regions
