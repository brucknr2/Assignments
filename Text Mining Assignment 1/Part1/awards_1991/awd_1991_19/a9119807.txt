Abstract    :
              This grant will provide funds to build and fly a balloon borne                 
              solar vector magnetograph from McMurdo, Antarctica.  The instrument            
              will have an unprecedented spatial resolution of better than 0.2               
              arcseconds and is expected to make continuous observations of the              
              sun for a period of 1-3 weeks.  The purpose of the investigation               
              will be to elucidate how the fibrous magnetic fields at the solar              
              surface emerge, coalesce, unravel and blow up in solar flares.                 
              This is important because magnetic fields must be the root cause of            
              flares and all other solar activity, yet the mechanism for                     
              converting magnetic energy into heat and motion is not understood.             
                                                                                             
              The grant will be jointly supported at NSF by the Polar Aeronomy               
              and Astrophysics Program in the Division of Polar Programs and by              
              the Solar-Terrestrial Program in the Division of Atmospheric                   
              Sciences and at NASA by the Solar Physics Branch in the Space                  
              Physics Division.  Logistical support will be provided by NSF and              
              the balloon and launch services will be provided by NASA.
