Abstract    :
              Descripton:  Under this project, ten U.S. scientists will                      
              participate in the "International Conference on Frontiers                      
              of Polymer Research" planned for January 20-25, 1991 in                        
              New  Delhi, India.  The Indian organizer is Dr. Ashok                          
              Misra, professor at the Indian Institute of Technology                         
              (IIT) in New Delhi.  Three areas of polymer research                           
              considered to be at the forefront will be covered.  These                      
              are: polymers for  photonics, where nonlinear optical                          
              properties of polymers show great promise; polymers for                        
              electronics, where new conduction mechanisms and                               
              photophysics have generated considerable enthusiasm; and                       
              high performance polymers which exhibit exceptionally high                     
              mechanical strength coupled with lightweight.  The                             
              conference will include a workshop to identify research                        
              opportunties, especially where collaboration can be                            
              effected.  The program committee include scientists from                       
              India, the U.S., Japan, FRG, Austria, Netherlands, Italy                       
              and Switzerland, thus a broad international participation                      
              is expected.  Conference proceedings is expected to be                         
              published as well as recommendations on research needs.                        
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The topics of the conference are quite timely,                         
              because of recent discovery in the physics and                                 
              photophysical properties of new polymers, and the new                          
              research approaches to understanding and synthesizing their                    
              materials.  The U.S. and India both are conducting                             
              extensive research in academic and industrial                                  
              laboratories.  The two cooperating scientists are well                         
              known and active researchers in the field.  The conference                     
              is quite likely to have a positive impact on U.S.-India                        
              cooperation in scientific research in chemistry and                            
              polymerscience.
