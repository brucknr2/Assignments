Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Cold Spring Harbor Symposium entitled "The Brain", is                     
              designed to focus on brain biology and behavior and to encourage               
              a way of thinking in neurobiology that bridges from molecules to               
              mental function.  By bringing together molecular neurobiology                  
              with systems neurobiology and model building, we hope to                       
              illustrate that these approaches reinforce each other in an                    
              attempt to understand the brain and its various functions.
