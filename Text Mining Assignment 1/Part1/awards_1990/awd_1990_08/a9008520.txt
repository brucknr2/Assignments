Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will continue his important studies of              
              three major areas of nonlinear wave theory:  nonlinear dispersive              
              waves, focussing of weak shock waves at caustics and catastrophic              
              instabilities in square-wave detonations.  The methods of study                
              involve the use of analytic and asymptotic techniques                          
              supplemented with numerical analysis.  Such a combined approach                
              is called for because the phenomena under study occur at the                   
              boundaries of existing theories.  Many phenomena in nature cannot              
              be described adequately with linear models;  nature is inherently              
              "nonlinear".  The proposed research involves the study of wave                 
              motions that are described by nonlinear differential equations.                
              A good example is the "breaking" of an ocean wave as it                        
              approaches the beach.  In order to describe the behavior of such               
              a nonlinear wave the principal investigator will use asymptotic                
              analysis in concert with numerical analysis to obtain qualitative              
              and quantitative information.
