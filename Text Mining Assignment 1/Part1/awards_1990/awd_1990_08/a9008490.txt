Abstract    :
              This proposal requested support form the National Science                      
              Foundation statewide connectivity for the Massachusetts system of              
              public higher education to the NSFNET through the New England                  
              Academic and Research Network (NEARNET).  The proposal can be                  
              divided into two parts.  One part would connect eight                          
              institutions to the NSFNET using routers and TCP/IP.  The second               
              part would be to provide another 21 campuses (mostly two year                  
              institutions) the ability to do a terminal logon to a central                  
              computer that had access to the internet by utilizing an existing              
              X.25 network that supports terminal logons.
