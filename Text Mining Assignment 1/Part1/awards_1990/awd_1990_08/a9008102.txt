Abstract    :
                   Professor Feldman will continue his research in ergodic                   
              theory with the following areas singled out for attention:                     
              (i) the extension of some of the ideas of equivalence of systems               
              from the situation where the group which is acting is the                      
              integers or the reals to the case where the group is only assumed              
              to be amenable, (ii) geodesic flows on smooth manifolds, and                   
              (iii) subrelations of ergodic equivalence relations.                           
                   Research in ergodic theory involves trying to understand                  
              the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated              
              or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail.  Under the                    
              heading "dynamics" can be placed the modern theory of how groups               
              of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces.  Another                     
              important theme in ergodic theory is the classification of                     
              systems into broad categories which are mathematically identical               
              in an abstract sense.  Professor Feldman's research will make                  
              contact with these areas.
