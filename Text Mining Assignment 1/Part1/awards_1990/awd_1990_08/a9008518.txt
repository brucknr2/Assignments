Abstract    :
              Inflatable dams are essentially cylindrical membrane structures                
              which are attached to a rigid horizontal base along two of their               
              generators.  They may be inflated by water, air, or a combination              
              of water and air.  Two-dimensional vibrations of long cylindrical              
              membranes were investigated under the previous grant.  This                    
              continuation will examine motions which vary along the dam.  In                
              addition, conditions of overflow will be analyzed, which are                   
              applicable when the dam is used to control water flow.  Conditions             
              which may lead to instability will be investigated theoretically               
              and experimentally.  The results of this study will improve our                
              understanding of the dynamic behavior of inflatable dams, and will             
              be useful in the prevention of future failures and in the wider                
              application of this economical type of structure.//
