Abstract    :
                   Professor Eoff will study the linear topological properties               
              of two spaces of functions which turn out to be quasi-Banach                   
              spaces under their natural topologies.  One of the main problems               
              involved is to characterize the Banach envelopes of these spaces.              
              In the case of one of these spaces, Professor Eoff has a                       
              conjecture she will try to verify.                                             
                   The spaces involved are rather unusual from many points of                
              view in that many of the basic properties familiar to                          
              mathematicians who work on function spaces are absent.  However,               
              these spaces arise naturally in the analysis of certain types of               
              functions and thus are important to understand.  Professor Eoff's              
              research will remove some of the mystery surrounding these                     
              spaces.  This project is part of the Research Opportunities for                
              Women activity.
