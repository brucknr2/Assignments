Abstract    :
                   This work will continue research on the role of vortex                    
              spin in collective motion, in particular the extension to half-                
              integer vortex spin.  In addition, work will be done on                        
              implementing the general tensor operator calculus using an                     
              extension of the vector-coherent-states technique.
