Abstract    :
                   Inferential procedures will be developed for the problem of               
              subhypothesis testing in a linear model.  The procedures will be               
              characterized by (i) local stability, i.e. their influence                     
              function will be bounded, (ii) global stability, i.e. their                    
              breakdown point and breakdown slopes will be nonzero, and (iii)                
              improved efficiency over existing robust procedures. Testing                   
              procedures based on estimators that are more efficient than the                
              Krasker-Welsch will be developed and investigated. The test                    
              procedures will be characterized according to their geometrical                
              properties and the possibility of constructing confidence                      
              intervals will be explored.
