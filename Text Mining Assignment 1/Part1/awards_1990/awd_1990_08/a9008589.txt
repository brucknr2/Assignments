Abstract    :
              Dr. Linda J. Magid is supported by a grant from the                            
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the                           
              aggregation of surface active agents in water and hydrocarbons                 
              by a variety of experimental techniques. These kinds of studies                
              may allow for the design of an entirely new family of                          
              detergents and, in addition, may allow us to learn more about                  
              the structure of cleansing agents.                                             
                                                                                             
              The main goals of the investigation are: (1) an assessment of                  
              the extent to which elongated micellar structures in solution                  
              behave as polymers, given the dynamics of micelle formation and                
              breakdown; (2) the dependence of the interfacial film                          
              fluctuations on surfactant (and aggregate) structure; (3) the                  
              development of techniques which enable differentiation between                 
              droplet and so-called biocontinuous morphologies of aggregation.
