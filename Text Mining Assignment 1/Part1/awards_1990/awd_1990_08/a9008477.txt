Abstract    :
              Under a Research Initiation Award, an investigation of near-                   
              wall vortex structures in a turbulent boundary layer is to be                  
              carried out.  The approach is a theoretical one, and is                        
              focused on the origin, stability, and dynamics of                              
              longitudinal, streamwise vortices.                                             
                                                                                             
              Turbulence structure, wall shear, and their control depend on                  
              resolving the characteristics and evolution of organized                       
              vortex structures embedded in the turbulence.
