Abstract    :
              The CVD deposition process will be studied with the goal of                    
              controlling and limiting the growth of columnar grains and                     
              promoting the growth of fine, equiaxed grains with improved                    
              tribological properties.  The process development will be based                
              on equilibrium and other thermodynamic calculations, followed                  
              by experimental deposition studies and tribological testing.                   
              Initial work will concentrate on tungsten carbide films.
