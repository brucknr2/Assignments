              Long & Medium-Term Research: Geochronological Applications of                  
              Cosmogenic Isotopes                                                            
                                                                                             
              This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long                   
              & Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                  
              program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                       
              conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                  
              proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                       
              conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or comple-                    
              mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                   
              foreign countries.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This award will support a twelve-month visit by Dr. Erik                       
              Brown to France to work with Drs Franoise Yiou and Grant M.                    
              Raisbeck at the Centre de Spectrometrie Nuclear et de                          
              Spectrometrie de Masse (C.S.N.S.M.) of the Orsay campus of                     
              the University of Paris on "Geochronological Applications of                   
              Cosmogenic Isotopes."  Our understanding of Earth's climatic                   
              history is dependent on terrestrial remnants of past                           
              glaciation, and on chemical and biological records preserved                   
              in deep-sea sediments and in polar ice.  Information regarding                 
              past changes in temperatures, oceanic circulation patterns,                    
              sea level and extent of glaciation has been derived from these                 
              sources, but absolute dating methods with which to tie data                    
              from one area of the globe to those from another have yet to                   
              be fully developed.  Many dating techniques involve the use                    
              of cosmogenic radioisotopes (e.g. carbon-14, beryllium-10,                     
              aluminum-26) which are products of the spallation of nuclei                    
              of terrestrial material by cosmic rays.  The proposed                          
              research will focus on developing two separate geochronological                
              methods using beryllium-10 and aluminum-26.  One of these is                   
              the determination of exposure ages of rock surfaces through                    
              the use of cosmogenic isotopes produced in situ within                         
              mineral lattices. This will allow the dating of deposits such                  
              as terminal moraines, providing an important tool for                          
              interpreting glacial history.  A second provides an absolute                   
              link between sedimentary and ice core records through the use                  
              of a pair of spikes in beryllium-10 concentrations observed                    
              in ice cores in snow laid down 35,000 years and 60,000 years                   
              ago.  If the same anomalies can be found in deep-sea sediments,                
              they can be used to link the sedimentary and ice core                          
              records, thus correlating oceanic and atmospheric histories.
