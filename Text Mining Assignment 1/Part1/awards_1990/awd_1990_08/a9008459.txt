Abstract    :
                   Professor Zuckerman will investigate the role of noncompact               
              Lie groups as internal symmetry groups of chiral models in                     
              physics.  The Lorentz group of Minkowski space-time is a basic                 
              example in Zuckerman's theory.  Thus the distinction between                   
              geometrical and internal symmetries becomes somewhat blurred in                
              this work.  This blurring may be relevant to applications of                   
              chiral models and noncompact groups to quantum gravity in two and              
              three dimensions.                                                              
                   Symmetry principles have played an essential role in quantum              
              mechanics and quantum field theory almost from the inception of                
              these branches of physics.  A quantum system may have geometrical              
              symmetries - inherited from the background space-time continuum -              
              and or internal symmetries - related to additional degrees of                  
              freedom.  Professor Zuckerman will investigate the basic                       
              mathematics of these symmetries.
