Abstract    :
              This is an ROW Research Planning Grant.  The P.I. recently                     
              emigrated from Russia, and will use the funds to develop                       
              her career in the U.S.  Her research area is roll-press                        
              compaction of powders, and the wear processes associated                       
              with this.
