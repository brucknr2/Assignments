Abstract    :
                   The object of this research is the analysis and                           
              interpretation of existing meteorological observations of                      
              microbursts, deep convection, and a unique tornado.  These topics              
              will also be pursued in a field experiment - Convection and                    
              Precipitation/Electrification Experiment (CAPE) - to be held near              
              Cape Kennedy during July and August 1990.
