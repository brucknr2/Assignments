Abstract    :
                   The Golden Lion Tamarin Conservation Project is an                        
              international collaborative effort to study the behavior ecology               
              and sociobiology of Leontopithecus rosalia, to conserve a                      
              significant portion of the biodiversity remaining tin the                      
              Atlantic Forest of Brazil.  The Atlantic Coastal Forest has the                
              highest level of endemism of any part of South America.  Among                 
              primates there are, in addition to several endemic species, tow                
              genera that occur naturally no where else on earth.  The golden                
              lion tamarin is one of these.  ?The muriqui, or woolly spider                  
              monkey (Brachyteles) is the other.!  They only survive because of              
              Reserves such as Poco da Antas where Dietz is doing his study.                 
              The project is unique among primate studies because not just a                 
              few, but a large number of groups are being monitored.  Knowledge              
              of their social behavior will allow an improved capability of                  
              keeping the remaining few individuals successfully in captivity.               
              The mating system of tamarins, generally, is among the most                    
              complex of any group of primates.  The detailed study of many                  
              groups, using marked individually identified animals, whose                    
              genetic structure will be known through DNA fingerprinting, will               
              continue to be the best and most thorough study of the variable                
              social system of any tamarin.  Keeping these rare animals alive                
              in the wild depends on (1) maintaining their habitat, (2) knowing              
              their social structure, behavior, and ecology (3) genetic                      
              management of remaining individuals, and (4) successful                        
              reintroduction of captive species into the wild.  Already this                 
              project has increased the number of tamarins in the wild by 25-                
              30%|  The infrastructure of the proposed research includes                     
              training Brazilian students, construction of facilities, training              
              of Brazilian administrators and guards in the Reserve, and                     
              improvement of the conservation ethic of local communities.
