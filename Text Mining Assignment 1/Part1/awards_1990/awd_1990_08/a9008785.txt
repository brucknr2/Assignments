Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this project is to develop a new model                
              of immigrant incorporation and test derived hypotheses for                     
              understanding the importance of family and ethnic bases of action              
              among contemporary U.S. immigrants.  Adaptive strategies of the                
              family are a special focus of the project, unlike previous                     
              research which has more often stressed ethnic solidarity and                   
              labor markets.  This research will show how the intertwining of                
              ethnic and family bases of action influences the incorporation of              
              Chinese, Korean, and Filipino immigrants in the greater Los                    
              Angeles area.  This research follows on a prior NSF-funded                     
              ethnographic field study in Los Angeles.  This research will                   
              conclude the field study and develop, translate, and pretest a                 
              questionnaire for a larger survey designed to complement the                   
              ongoing field study.  Analyses of the proposed model would be                  
              carried out with event history, least squares, and multinominal                
              logistic estimation techniques.
