Abstract    :
                   The inverse problem of determining the initial boundary                   
              conditions of a system evolving in space and time from incomplete              
              observations of the system at various points interior to the                   
              spatial domain, is of considerable importance in many engineering              
              and scientific applications.  This project deals with a selection              
              of theoretical and numerical aspects of these problems for                     
              certain classes of parabolic partial differential equations.                   
                   Determination of surface temperature and heat flux from a                 
              finite set of interior temperature measurements stable under                   
              noisy data will be investigated.  Theoretical and numerical                    
              analysis of methods involving eigenfunction expansions of initial              
              data and Whittaker Cardinal expansions of initial boundary data                
              will be studied.
