Abstract    :
                   This action will enable a small group of physicists at                    
              Virginia Polytechnic to continue its research.  The group                      
              consists of two faculty members, one senior engineer, one                      
              research associate and one student.  The group is working on                   
              the fabrication of a particle detector to be used at the                       
              electron-proton colliding beam facility currently under                        
              construction in Hamburg, Germany.  The fabrication of the                      
              detector is an international effort involving physicists from                  
              ten countries.  The US component of the collaboration,                         
              consisting of seven universities and one national laboratory,                  
              has responsibility for the barrel calorimeter, one of the major                
              subsystems of the detector.  The photomultipliers bases for the                
              calorimeter were developed and are being built by VPI.  Other                  
              NSF supported groups in the collaboration are from Columbia                    
              University, Pennsylvania State University and the University of                
              Iowa.  Operation of the detector is scheduled for 1991.  VPI is                
              developing software and studying the radiative corrections                     
              required for the interpretation of the data.  The group will                   
              also conduct R&D on detectors for the Superconducting Super                    
              Collider.
