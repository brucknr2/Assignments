Abstract    :
              The main goal of the research is to construct a theory of testing that         
              leads to provable statements about programs.  This theory shows that           
              testing can "prove" that certain programs are error-free.  The class           
              of programs that this theory applies to includes a number of important         
              programs.  However, the theory does not provide absolute correctness.          
              It does prove that a computation is correct with a certain                     
              probability.  Since this probability can be made as close to l as              
              desired, this suffices for practical purposes.  It is important to             
              note that this probability is not an empirical statement: it is a              
              rigorous statement about mathematics.
