Abstract    :
              This project in theoretical high energy physics will deal with                 
              quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of interactions of                    
              quarks and gluons, topological aspects of field theory, and                    
              superunification theory.  The project is divided into three                    
              parts:  (1) a study of various topological aspects of quantum                  
              physics (quantum mechanics and field theory, particle and                      
              condensed matter physics), a study of fundamental problems in                  
              superstring theory, and a study of some phenomenological                       
              consequences of superunification; (2) a study of the long-range                
              structure of the QCD plasma and its phenomenological                           
              consequences for heavy ion collisions, the evolution of the                    
              universe, and the dynamics of neutron stars; (3) a study of the                
              phenomenology of confined QCD.  All of these studies deepen and                
              broaden our understanding of the fundamental interactions of                   
              matter.  Several of them are quite important to our                            
              understanding of the strong (nuclear) interactions of quarks.
