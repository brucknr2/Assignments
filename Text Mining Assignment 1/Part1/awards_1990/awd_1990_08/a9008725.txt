Abstract    :
              Until recently, one could expect the proof that a problem has a                
              polynomial time solution to include an algorithm that could be used to         
              obtain the solution.  Now, however, a number of problems, including            
              many from the VLSI domain, are known to have low degree                        
              polynomial-time decision algorithms, yet the algorithms themselves             
              are not known. These algorithms depend on the existence of a finite            
              but unknown number of forbidden graphs (an obstruction set).  This             
              research examines the question of whether full knowledge of an                 
              obstruction set is really required to solve problems in practice.              
                                                                                             
              This research focuses on the gate matrix layout problem.  Since some           
              obstruction sets for the problem are known, the feasibility of                 
              designing algorithms that utilize only part of those sets of graphs            
              will be studied.  This will include identification of those                    
              obstructions likely to be found in practice and the design and                 
              implementation of algorithms to test for containment of those graphs.          
              It also examines which techniques used to isolate the ostructions for          
              gate matrix layout can be applied to other layout permutation                  
              problems as well.
