Abstract    :
                   Brayton Gray plans to study the unstable development of                   
              periodic families in the homotopy groups of spheres through the                
              use of higher order periodic EHP spectral sequences.  Basically,               
              this is an investigation of one of the principal algebraic tools               
              of topology, namely homotopy theory, which seeks to make it more               
              manageable by discovering repeating patterns.
