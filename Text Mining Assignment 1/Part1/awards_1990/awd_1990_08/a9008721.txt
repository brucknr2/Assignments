Abstract    :
                   The dimensional scaling approach used successfully in                     
              elementary particle theory is applied to problems in atomic                    
              physics.  Applications already made to bound state problems                    
              suggest that the method, like other perturbation theories, has                 
              some potential as a quantitative tool in atomic physics.  The                  
              applications anticipated here are to problems involving the                    
              doubly excited states of He. These states are autoionizing and                 
              the work would be the first such application of the 1/D                        
              expansion to the continuum problem.  The method has the                        
              advantage that it treats collective motion of the particles                    
              much more easily than other approaches.  This is important for                 
              an accurate description of the excited states of He.
