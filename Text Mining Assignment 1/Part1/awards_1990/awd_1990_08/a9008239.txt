Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Theoretical studies will be conducted on the physics of two                    
              outstanding problems relating to high temperature superconductors              
              - the anomalous superconducting fluctuations and the strong                    
              electron correlation problem.  In particular, detailed                         
              calculations will be done to improve our understanding of the                  
              ground state of the superconducting oxides in a magnetic field.                
              Further work will be conducted on the mechanism driving the                    
              superconductivity and the nature of the pairing, as well as the                
              anomalous properties of the normal state.
