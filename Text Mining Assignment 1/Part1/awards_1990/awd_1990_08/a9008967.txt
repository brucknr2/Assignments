Abstract    :
                   One of the principal aims of magnetospheric research is to                
              understand how solar wind particles and energy are transported                 
              throughout the magnetosphere.  The magnetotail plays an                        
              important role in this transport.  The region at about a radial                
              distance of 8-10RE has recently been observed to be in the so-                 
              called current disruption region which may be a signature of the               
              onset of a magnetospheric substorm.  This grant is to investigate              
              the role the collisionless tearing instability plays in the                    
              current disruption process.  The research will focus of the                    
              verification of the analytical theory of tearing modes by                      
              particle simulations and the development of a nonlinear theory                 
              of such modes. ***
