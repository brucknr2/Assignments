Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of several aspects of the ways in which                   
              rhythmic movement patterns can be altered, and the ways in which               
              functionally related movement patterns are coordinated with one                
              another.  The PI will study these problems at the level of                     
              individual nerve cells in the simple nervous system of the                     
              lobster.  The role of different neuropeptide neurotransmitters in              
              the rhythmic patterns of cardiac sac and gastric neurons will be               
              examined.  This research will lead to a better understanding of                
              neurons control complicated integrated movements.
