Abstract    :
              Under a Phase II SBIR award the deposition of polymer                          
              coatings by pulsed plasmas will be studied.  The effects of                    
              process parameters and substrate bias on coating composition                   
              will be evaluated with special emphasis on the effects of                      
              duty cycle, pulse width, RF frequency and absorbed power.                      
              A variety of products will be coated for testing in                            
              commercial applications where abrasion resistance, surface                     
              hardness and surface adhesion are important.
