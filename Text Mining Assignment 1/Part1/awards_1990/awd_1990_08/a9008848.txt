Abstract    :
                   One of the most intriguing questions in evolutionary biology              
              at the present time is:  why do so many natural populations have               
              males and females?  Stated in another way:  why don't females                  
              reproduce asexually and thereby produce only clonal daughters?                 
              Assuming no concomitant reduction in fecundity, a rare asexual                 
              female would produce twice as many daughters (and four times as                
              many granddaughters) as the average sexual female; and unchecked,              
              the resulting clone would grow exponentially, eventually                       
              replacing the sexual females and males in the population. That                 
              sexual reproduction persists in the face of the advantage of                   
              clones suggests that there is an advantage to producing variable               
              offspring.  It is currently unknown, however, what this                        
              advantage is.                                                                  
                   To address the question, it is important to study species                 
              that have both reproduction modes, so that there is a firm basis               
              for comparison.  In one such species, a freshwater New Zealand                 
              snail, sexual reproduction is correlated with the incidence of                 
              infection by parasitic worms, which is consistent with the idea                
              that the production of variable progeny is favored in                          
              populations where there is a high risk of parasitism.  The goals               
              present study are to:  (1) determine whether  there is a genetic               
              basis to the host-parasite  interaction, (2) establish whether                 
              parasites can prevent the elimination of sexual individuals by                 
              one or more clones, and (3) to assess the effect of parasites on               
              the maintenance of genetic diversity within snail populations.                 
              In addition to addressing important questions regarding sexual                 
              versus clonal reproduction, the results of these studies have                  
              important  implications for  the study of diseases caused by                   
              similar worms that cycle through snail vectors (e.g. human                     
              schistosomiasis), and the role that biological enemies play in                 
              preserving genetic diversity of natural populations.
