Abstract    :
                   With this award the principal investigator will continue his              
              studies into the numerical analysis of phase transitions and free              
              boundary problems that arise in fluid dynamics and elasticity.                 
              In particular, he will analyze, design and implement adaptive                  
              finite element methods for the solution of the Phase Field Model               
              and the Cahn-Hilliard equation.  Special emphasis will be placed               
              upon stability and error analyses in nonenergy norms, such as the              
              maximum norm, and upon the efficiency and reliability of the                   
              resulting algorithms.                                                          
                   Many phenomena in nature involve what are called free                     
              boundary problems, wherein a large part of the solution process                
              is devoted to determining the location of a moving boundary                    
              between two or more different media.  A good example is a weather              
              forecast or the weather map in your newspaper.  Here                           
              meteorologists try to predict the speed and location of fronts;                
              in this context fronts are the words used for moving boundaries                
              between warm and cold air, for example.  With this the principal               
              investigator  will design numerical methods for finding the                    
              solution of some free boundary problems that come from the theory              
              of elasticity.
