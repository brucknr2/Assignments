Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics will cover a wide variety                 
              of topics, including superstring and supersymmetry theory,                     
              lattice field theory, perturbative quantum chromodynamics,                     
              collisions involving elementary particles, collisions involving                
              nuclei, statistical mechanics, and problems at the interface                   
              between classical and quantum mechanics.  This broad research                  
              program includes efforts to unify our description of all the                   
              forces, attempts to better understand the behavior of the                      
              elementary particles, and studies which illuminate basic                       
              physical principles by revealing their consequences in                         
              interesting physical situations.
