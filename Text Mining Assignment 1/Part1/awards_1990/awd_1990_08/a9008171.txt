Abstract    :
              This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface                    
              chemistry and in the subfield of electroanalytical chemistry.                  
              Professor Fawcett will study the fundamental steps in the                      
              deposition of metals on electrodes using a variety of                          
              electrochemical methods together with reflection infrared                      
              absorption spectroscopy.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This research will examine the details of underpotential                       
              deposition of metals on mercury and gold electrodes.  By                       
              measuring the kinetics and thermodynamics of these reactions                   
              using spectroelectrochemical methods the mechanisms that                       
              describe these basic reactions will be elucidated.  This                       
              information is relevant to important technological problems in                 
              electrocatalysis and corrosion.
