Abstract    :
                   This is a theoretical physics project to calculate some                   
              properties of matter at extremely high temperatures (1010 times                
              room temperature) and high densities (1015 times normal).                      
              These conditions occurred in the early universe and are                        
              recreated in particle accelerators that collide very large                     
              nucleii.  One part of the investigation will attempt to                        
              calculate scattering probabilities directly from thermally-                    
              averaged correlation functions.  A second part will investigate                
              the physical significance of the wave excitations known as                     
              quasiparticles that can propagate at ultra-high temperature.                   
              These calculations will help test how successful the so called,                
              "standard model" of elementary particles is when applied to                    
              extreme conditions.  The standard model is a theory which has                  
              very successfully described the behavior of the elementary                     
              particle constituents of matter under non-extreme conditions.                  
              It will be very interesting if it also succeeds at extreme                     
              temperatures and densities.
