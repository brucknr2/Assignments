Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Facial expression is very important but little or nothing is              
              known about how or where the brain mechanisms for controlling                  
              facial movements exist. It is known that certain drugs such as                 
              amphetamine produce among other effects, a stereotyped set of                  
              movements including facial movements.  The PI has discovered that              
              by injecting small amounts of amphetamine into a specific part of              
              the brain she can produce pure facial movements.  This discovery               
              provides a new approach to defining the neurons which are                      
              involved in the movements, in terms of their neuroanatomy and the              
              neurtransmitters which they use.  It is an interesting new line                
              of research which can gives us some precision in sorting out                   
              brain pathways related to behavior.
