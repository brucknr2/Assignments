Abstract    :
                   Among many unique animals and plants on the island of                     
              Madagascar are more than forty species of lemuriform primates.                 
              In terms of skeletal anatomy these animals represent the best                  
              living analogues for the earliest euprimates (Eocene Adapidae and              
              Omomyidae).  Thus, a study of the positional behavior (posture                 
              and locomotion) of these animals is crucial for a thorough                     
              understanding of the locomotor system of early primates.                       
              Although aspects of social behavior and ecology of Malagasy                    
              lemurs have been the subject of several studies, positional                    
              behavior has not received the detailed, objective, quantitative                
              scrutiny it needs in order to generate the kinds of data most                  
              useful for integration with morphological and historical studies.              
              The purpose of this project is to collect such data for six                    
              species of Malagasy lemurs living among a community of 12 species              
              at Ranomafana National Park.  The number of species, ranges of                 
              body sizes, phylogenetic diversity, and microhabitats represented              
              by these animals allow many crucial comparisons to be made which               
              test the influence of various factors on the expressions of                    
              positional behavior.  The results generated from this study will               
              be compared with similar studies on other primates, with the aim               
              of generating and testing the nature and regularity of the                     
              influence of body size, habitat structure, and heritage on                     
              primate positional behavior.
