Abstract    :
              This a workshop on neural net applications in                                  
              electric power engineering.  The objectives of                                 
              the workshop are to identify the most logical                                  
              and most appropriate areas of application of                                   
              neural net methodology in power engineering;                                   
              at the same time it is hoped to identify the                                   
              least appropriate areas of application.                                        
              Neural net methodology is a controversial area                                 
              of study and we hope to attract proponents and                                 
              persons who are not proponents of the                                          
              technique.
