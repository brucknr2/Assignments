Abstract    :
                  The importance of deep convection in the tropics to the                    
              global circulation has been recognized for some time.  In 1986 a               
              pilot experiment termed the Equatorial Mesoscale Experiment                    
              (EMEX) was held off the northern coast of Australia to obtain                  
              measurements of the redistribution in the vertical of heat and                 
              moisture by deep convection.                                                   
                                                                                             
                  The Principal Investigator was a participant in EMEX and he                
              will continue his analysis of the rich EMEX data set.  His main                
              objective will be to use in situ and remote sensing data                       
              (especially airborne Doppler and conventional radar) to determine              
              the vertical profile of vertical velocity and heating of the                   
              large scale environment associated with oceanic cloud clusters.                
              The results of this research will increase fundamental                         
              understanding of tropical clouds clusters and may lead to                      
              improved parameterizations in numerical models.
