Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Mexico award will support U.S. and Latin American                    
              participation in the Fourth Latin American Congress of                         
              Probability and Mathematical Statistics to be held in Mexico                   
              City, Mexico from September 24 to 29, 1990.  The U.S.                          
              organizer for this meeting is Professor Richard Griego of                      
              the University of New Mexico; the Mexican organizer is                         
              Professor Luis Gorostiza of the Centro de Investigacion del                    
              Instituto Politecnico Nacional (CINVESTAV) in Mexico City.                     
                                                                                             
              The Congress will bring together about 170 participants from                   
              Latin America and will feature invited addresses, short                        
              courses, special workshops, and participant lectures.  Topics                  
              to be presented at the Congress include the theory and                         
              applications of large deviations, convergence of stochastic                    
              processes, stochastic integration and control theory,                          
              infinite particle systems, measure-valued stochastic processes,                
              random evolutions, and mathematical statistics.  The meeting                   
              should provide an opportunity for initiating and continuing                    
              joint collaborations between U.S. and Latin American                           
              researchers.  The Science in Developing Country Program is                     
              also providing support to promote the participation of a                       
              greater number of Latin American researchers.
