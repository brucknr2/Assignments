Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              To develop a computer program which can simulate the growth                    
              of GaAs and related compounds on patterned substrates by                       
              Organometallic Chemical Vapor Deposition (OMCVD).  The                         
              growth simulation is based on the Wulff construction                           
              technique which has been shown to accurately predict the                       
              shapes of epitaxial layers grown on patterned substrates.                      
              In order to perform the Wulff constructions a detailed                         
              knowledge of the oreintation dependence of the growth rate                     
              is needed.  Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of the                    
              OMCVD growth rate as a function of crystallographic                            
              orientation, growth temperature, and alloy composition will                    
              be conducted.  Such a simulation program will be very                          
              useful for designing discrete and/or integrated microwave                      
              millimeter-wave, and optoelectronic devices and circuits.
