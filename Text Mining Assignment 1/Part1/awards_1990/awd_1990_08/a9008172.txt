Abstract    :
              Both polarities of the repetitive-sequence, multimeric forms of                
              the satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot virus (sTobRV RNA) cleave                
              autolytically and specifically to generate 359 nucleotide                      
              residue (nt), "monomeric" sTobRV RNA.  The negative polarity                   
              sTobRV (-)RNA also spontaneously ligates to perform the cleaved                
              3'-to-5'ApG phosphodiester.  sTobRV (-)RNA does not conform to                 
              the well-studied "hammerhead" structure, which does apply to                   
              sTobRV (+)RNA.  The cleavage-active sequences of sTobRV (-)RNA                 
              are dispersed in two regions of the molecule, forming a natural                
              "ribozyme" system.  E, an oligoribonucleotide corresponding to                 
              one of these two regions, acted on the other, S, and cleaved it                
              at the ApG phosphodiester.  Two segments of base pairing between               
              E and S previously have been identified.  We propose a systematic              
              mutagenesis of specific regions of the E-S complex to identify                 
              critical nt.  The complex also will be subjected to chemical                   
              modification to identify tertiary interactions, and a screen has               
              been designed to identify mutations which compensate for                       
              inactivating mutations.  Novel forms of the self-cleaving                      
              sequence have been synthesized, or planned, to facilitate the                  
              proposed investigations.  We expect that the information gathered              
              will allow us to propose a structural model for the cleavage-                  
              ligation-complex.  The results will improve our understanding of               
              sTobRV RNA replication and facilitate "ribozyme" design.
