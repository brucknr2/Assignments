Abstract    :
              With support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                              
              Organometallic Chemistry Program Dr. Donald F. Gaines will                     
              investigate the mechanisms of reactions of boron-containing                    
              cluster molecules and also synthesize new molecules of this                    
              type. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of this                  
              important area of chemistry, the results have potential                        
              applications in energy storage and solid state materials.                      
                                                                                             
              This project combines exploratory synthetic investigations of                  
              boron hydride cluster molecules and their derivatives with                     
              investigations of the mechanisms of their formation,                           
              rearrangement and reactions. The mechanisms of reactions and                   
              rearrangements of selected derivatives of borane and carborane                 
              clusters will be investigated using stereospecific boron                       
              isotopic labeling as the diagnostic probe and B-10 and B-11 NMR                
              spectroscopic analysis. New routes and mechanistic pathways for                
              the mono- and polyalkylation of boranes will be developed using                
              a variety of approaches based on recent new catalysts and                      
              alkylating agents. The long-lived intermediate formed during                   
              the hydridic reduction of boron-halogen bonds by trialkyltin                   
              hydrides will be characterized. Novel classes of group-V-                      
              containing heteroatom boron clusters will be prepared using                    
              alternative strategies such as simultaneous insertion of boron                 
              and nitrogen, extensions of the strategies used recently to                    
              prepare new types of nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing borane                
              clusters.
