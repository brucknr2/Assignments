Abstract    :
                   The project is aimed at simplifying the task of programming               
              machines like the Intel iPSC/2 and the BBN Butterfly in which local            
              memory operations are much faster than inter-processor communication.          
              Currently, programmers must worry about exploiting spatial locality of         
              reference when programming these machines.  This system will shoulder          
              much of that burden.  A first version of this software is almost               
              complete.  SIMPLE, a large scientific benchmark from Los Alamos, was           
              run on the Intel iPSC/2.   The code, yielded 2 MFlops from a 32                
              processor iPSC/2 (without vector boards).
