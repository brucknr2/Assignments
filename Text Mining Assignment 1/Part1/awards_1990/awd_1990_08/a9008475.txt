Abstract    :
                   A broad class of transport processes in matter at high                    
              densities and temperatures will be studied.  One of the main                   
              objectives of this theoretical physics research will be to                     
              study the role played by weakly interacting particles under                    
              astrophysical settings in order to obtain clues to the                         
              properties of these particles.  The specific questions to be                   
              addressed are as follows:  What are the effects of such                        
              particles on stellar evolution, especially when they are                       
              produced thermally and contribute as an energy loss mechanism?                 
              Can one obtain any constraints on these particles from                         
              observational data of stellar evolution?  In additional work,                  
              the properties of relativistic shock waves in which electron-                  
              positron pairs are produced in the post-shock matter,                          
              astrophysical plasmas, quark matter, and positron transport                    
              will be studied.                                                               
                   The outcome of these studies is expected to elucidate the                 
              new interactions in particle physics and to contribute to a                    
              better understanding of matter under extreme conditions in                     
              many-body physics.  The results will have a direct bearing on                  
              observational astronomy at radio to X-ray and gamma-ray                        
              wavelengths.
