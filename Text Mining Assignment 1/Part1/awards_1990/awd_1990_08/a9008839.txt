Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop a system controller based upon         
              neural computing techniques that can be efficiently implemented using          
              currently available digital VLSI technology.  The controller will be           
              capable of continuously adapting to changes in its environment by using        
              a learning algorithm and associative memory as the basis for its               
              operation.  This research explores the use of digital associative memory       
              coupled with fuzzy logic matching techniques in the design of such an          
              adaptive associative processor.  In contrast to a conventional computer,       
              the associative processor will not operate in a deterministic fashion.         
              Instead, its operation will be probabilistic and based upon a given set        
              of heuristics.  By using a closest-fit data matching unit, it will             
              attempt to find a relatively optimal solution via associative and              
              iterative techniques.  A scoring unit will monitor its operation in            
              order to provide feedback to the system.  Although we anticipate               
              implementing this processor using digital VLSI technology, investigation       
              using computer simulations is a first step.  A biped walker paradigm is        
              used as a tool for developing the associative processor and learning           
              algorithms.  As a result of this investigation, we intend to build such        
              a biped walker robot controlled by the VLSI associative processor.
