Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Differential geometry of infinite dimensional manifolds is                
              basic to the study of quantum field theory.  The principal                     
              investigator will extend his results on iterated integrals and                 
              the Witten current for the Dirac operator developed under the                  
              previous grant to the setting of supersymmetric conformal field                
              theory.  He will continue his development of analytic tools for                
              loop spaces.  These include logarithmic Sobolev inequalities,                  
              singular integral estimates, deRham cohomology and the Feynman-                
              Kac formula.  Lastly, he will investigate applications of Connes'              
              theory of non-commutative differential geometry including links                
              to quantum field theory.                                                       
                   Classical field theory involves assigning to each point of                
              four-dimensional space-time a vector or scalar quantity such as                
              the electrical field or temperature.  In quantum field theory                  
              usually some sort of operator or function is assigned to each                  
              point in space-time.  Using inner products, from these operators               
              an observable quantity may result which then can be checked by                 
              repeated experimentation.  In this project subtle properties of                
              quantum fields will be investigated using infinite dimensional                 
              hypersurfaces and a mathematician's tool known as loop spaces.
