Abstract    :
              Traditional biochemical approaches have been largely unsuccessful              
              in the study of the membrane-bound enzymes involved in lipid                   
              metabolism.  The characterization of mutants of Arabidopsis                    
              deficient in lipid biosynthesis provides opportunities to clone                
              the genes involved without first purifying the corresponding                   
              proteins.  Chromosome walking will undoubtedly be successful, but              
              this approach requires a very large amount of effort for each                  
              gene cloned.  This project determines whether any mutants in                   
              lipid metabolism can be identified in a population of 1,800                    
              Arabidopsis lines containing stably integrated T-DNA inserts.                  
              When a mutation is found and shown to cosegregate with the                     
              kanamycin resistance marker located in the T-DNA, then a                       
              substantial effort to complete the cloning and characterization                
              of the gene is justified.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Fatty acid unsaturation is a determinant of the quality and                    
              economic value of the product from oilseed crop species.  Because              
              of the importance of unsaturated fatty acids in human health, it               
              would be advantageous to be able to control the degree of                      
              unsaturation of the lipids in these species.  A crucial step                   
              toward this goal is to understand the molecular basis of                       
              desaturation.  This research provides for this by identifying                  
              fatty acid mutants to be used for the isolation and cloning of                 
              genes encoding the enzymes responsible for desaturation.  This                 
              further allows for the development of strategies to alter                      
              usefully the fatty acid composition of vegatable oils.
