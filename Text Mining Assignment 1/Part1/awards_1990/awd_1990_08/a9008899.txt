Abstract    :
              The object of this research is to conduct                                      
              femtosecond measurements in bulk InGaP to                                      
              gain experience of subpicosecond measurement                                   
              techniques to obtain preliminary results for the                               
              preparation of a proposal to study the dynamics                                
              of carriers in InGaP based multiple quantum                                    
              wells at atmospheric and high pressure.  A                                     
              model will be developed to evaluate the effect                                 
              of pressure on the relaxation of carriers in the                               
              InGaP based multiple quantum wells.  The                                       
              study of the subpicosecond dynamics of                                         
              semiconductors at high pressure is an area that                                
              has so far not been explored and likely to                                     
              contribute important information on these                                      
              materials.  A detailed proposal will be                                        
              submitted to NSF Research Initiation Award                                     
              Program at the completion of the proposed                                      
              preliminary studies.
