Abstract    :
                   Integrals play an important role in a wide variety of                     
              practical statistical calculations.  They give means,                          
              covariances, and various kinds of conditional and unconditional                
              probabilities.  Many of these integrals are defined over regions               
              in multiple dimensions, and they do not have values that can be                
              obtained from formulas or tables.  Integrals of this type must be              
              estimated numerically, often using computationally intensive                   
              algorithms. More efficient methods will be developed in this                   
              research for the numerical computation of multiple integrals that              
              arise in statistical computations. Attention will be focused on                
              the use of subregion adaptive algorithms and better algorithms of              
              this type will be developed through the use of specialized                     
              transformation techniques and better basic integrations rules                  
              that take account of the particular features of statistical                    
              integration problems.  The algorithms will be implemented in                   
              public domain software which will be made available over                       
              electronic mail networks and interfaced to the S system for                    
              statistical computation on scientific workstations.
