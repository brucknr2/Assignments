Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Hydra is the most primitive metazoan possessing a nervous system.              
              This multicellular animal has been a favorite model for                        
              developmental studies, yet electrophysiological studies are                    
              practically non-existent.  For a number of technical reasons the               
              application of traditional electrophysiological techniques using               
              hydrozoans have proven to be quite difficult and overall not                   
              successful.  This study will examine the properties of                         
              dissociated Hydra neurons by utilizing the technique of patch                  
              clamping.  This microelectrode technique permits the recording of              
              ion channels from cells too small that would not be possible with              
              traditional electrophysiological methods.  The effects of a                    
              putative neurotransmitter on whole cell ionic currents and single              
              channels activity of hydra nerve and epithelial cell membranes                 
              will be studied.  Results from this study will provide additional              
              information on membrane function and physiology of chemical                    
              transmission in hydra cells.
