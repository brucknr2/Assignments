Abstract    :
              This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two                
              years.  The project is entitled "The Purification of the VirB11                
              Protein, Characterization of the ATPase and Autophosphorylation                
              Activities, and Study of the Role of the VirB11 Protein on T-DNA               
              Transfer in A. tumefaciens."                                                   
                                                                                             
              The Research Fellowships in Plant Biology are granted to                       
              applicants trained in traditional areas of plant biology who wish              
              to extend their training in new techniques and to those trained                
              in molecular or cellular techniques who wish to gain experience                
              working with plants.  These fellowships are designed to increase               
              the number of outstanding young scientists in plant biology.
