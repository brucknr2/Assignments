Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to                                           
              combine the advantages of                                                      
              holographic image processing in                                                
              photorefractive semiconductors, with                                           
              the resonant enhancement of electro-                                           
              optic properties using quantum-                                                
              confined excitons.  This objective                                             
              will result in the first systematic                                            
              study of semi-insulating multiple                                              
              quantum wells and their application                                            
              to image processing.  Significant                                              
              resonant enhancement of                                                        
              photorefractive diffraction is                                                 
              possible.  Semiconductor already                                               
              have the advantage of fast device                                              
              speed.  The quantum wells must be                                              
              semi-insulting to allow spatial                                                
              modulation of electric fields.  In                                             
              the proposed research, multiple                                                
              quantum well structures will be                                                
              grown by molecular beam epitaxy and                                            
              will be made semi-insulating by ion                                            
              implantation.  The differential                                                
              transmission of wavelengths that are                                           
              near the fundamental absorption of                                             
              the quantum wells will be measured                                             
              as an alternating electric field is                                            
              applied across the quantum wells.                                              
              Holographic gratings will be imposed                                           
              on the wells using the interference                                            
              of two coherent, low-power, cw laser                                           
              beams that can be turned

              absorption.  The research has                                                  
              significance because it will yield                                             
              image processing devices that are                                              
              limited in resolution only by
