Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the computer modelling of the                  
              fluid dynamics of aquatic animal propulsion, in which the fluid                
              motion is described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations              
              and the immersed organism is regarded as a filament undergoing                 
              time-dependent motion.  In contrast to previous studies there is               
              no restriction placed on the size of the Reynolds number or on                 
              the dependence of the amplitude of the swimming motion upon its                
              direction.  Among the specific goals of the research are the                   
              modelling of different modes of swimming such as jet propulsion                
              and undulation and the modelling of three-dimensional motions.                 
              The motions of immersed animals in water have always been of                   
              interest to naturalists and fluid dynamicists, both for their                  
              inherent aesthetic beauty and for the insights they provide into               
              our understanding of the fluid dynamics of bodies moving in air                
              and water.  Here the principal investigator will use the power of              
              a supercomputer to model the behavior of organisms swimming in                 
              water over a range of body shapes and sizes and speeds that has                
              not been attempted before.
