Abstract    :
              The RUI grant provides partial funding needed to purchase a                    
              Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) for the Department              
              of Chemistry and Physics at Augusta College, Augusta, GA.  The                 
              FTIR is urgently needed to initiate a teaching and research                    
              program to meet the technological training demands of                          
              undergraduate scientists.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The research program to be initiated deals with the potential                  
              development of FT emission into an on-line, noninvasive technique              
              for polymer analysis and the preparation, purification, and                    
              analysis of organogermanes for kinetics studies.  Undergraduates               
              will be highly involved in the research.
