Abstract    :
              This Research Opportuniites for Women Research Planning Grant                  
              is in the general area of inorganic chemistry.  Dr. Edith J.                   
              Parsons of the Chemistry Department of Clemson University will                 
              attempt to prepare a series of binuclear Mn, Mo and Ru                         
              complexes in an effort to bind and deoxygenate carbon dioxide.                 
              The resulting metal-oxo complexes will be used an oxygen                       
              transfer agents to organic compounds such as cyclohexene.  The                 
              ligands used in the complexes are polypodal and their                          
              preparation is the first step in the project.  If promising                    
              results are achieved a proposal for sustained study of the                     
              system will be prepared.
