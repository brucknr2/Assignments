Abstract    :
              This project is to develop an environment for interactive                      
              prototyping of two-dimensional and three-dimensional user                      
              interfaces.  The environment consists of an integrated set of tools            
              that support the design, prototyping, reconfiguration, and testing             
              of graphical user interfaces, without involving and traditional                
              notion of "programming."  The tools will allow a naive or                      
              sophisticated user to configure and generate a user interface by               
              interactively specifying the 2D and 3D graphics, graphical events              
              and various manipulations of pictures, and the user/system dialogue.
