Abstract    :
              This award will enable Dr. Philip D. Laird of the NASA Ames                    
              Research Center to conduct collaborative research for six months               
              with Dr. Taisuke Sato of the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL)                 
              Tsukuba, Japan.  They will conduct research in the area of machine             
              learning.  In artificial intelligence applications, analytical                 
              learning algorithms are meant to find ways to avoid unproductive               
              steps by assessing the performance of a machine program as it                  
              runs.  This project will experimentally evaluate problem-specific              
              analytical learning algorithms.  Techniques for implementing the               
              analytical learning component will be explored.  A model for                   
              designing the utility component of the learning element, so that               
              the changes proposed by the analytical learning algorithms can be              
              evaluated and intergrated into the program, will be developed.                 
                                                                                             
              Research in the area of analytical learning remains largely                    
              theoretical.  Dr. Sato's research group at ETL, working on logical             
              inference and knowledge representation and acquisition, will be                
              able to provide effective testbeds for concepts developed by the               
              P.I.
