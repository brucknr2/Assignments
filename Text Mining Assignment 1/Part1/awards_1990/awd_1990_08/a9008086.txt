Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is  an award under the Research at Undergraduate                          
              Institutions program.  The objective of the research is the                    
              investigation of the surface and electronic properties of                      
              zirconium boride system.  Single crystal specimens are being                   
              grown by an arc-induced zone melting technique.  Scanning Auger                
              spectrometry is used to determine the chemical composition of the              
              surfaces.  Thermionic projection microscopy is used to measure                 
              work function of the various crystallographic planes.  X-ray                   
              photoelectron spectroscopy is used to determine the electronic                 
              band structure.  The work function of these materials is being                 
              modelled.  A high emphasis is being placed on the training of                  
              undergraduate students for future careers in graduate education                
              and research.
