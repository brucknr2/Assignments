Abstract    :
              This is a Research Opportunities for Women research planning                   
              award, which will allow the PI to spend a sabbatical working on                
              the processes of  eruption, transport, deposition and induration               
              of Snake River Plain tuffs.  It will involve field mapping with                
              members of the Idaho Survey, as well as microscopic and SEM study              
              of the tuffs.  The PI hopes to define objectives for further                   
              study of Snake River Plain materials which will lead to a four-                
              dimensional overview of the volcanic/hydrologic evolution of the               
              entire field.
