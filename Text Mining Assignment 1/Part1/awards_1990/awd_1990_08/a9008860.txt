Abstract    :
              This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award                 
              is in the general area of physical chemistry.  Dr. Amy E.                      
              Miller of the University of Oklahoma will study the intrinsic                  
              acidity of organometallic hydrides in the gas phase by                         
              determining enthalpies of dissociation into free metal anions                  
              and free protons.  Construction of a flowing afterglow                         
              ion-molecule reactor to determine the kinetics of protron                      
              abstraction from neutral acids by metal anions is central to                   
              the project.  Compounds containing trifluorophosphine ligands,                 
              expected to be "superacids", will be among those synthesized                   
              and tested.  A postdoctoral associate with participate in the                  
              program, which will enable Dr. Miller to expand her laboratory                 
              to include an instrumental component in addition to the                        
              synthesis capabilities already in place.
