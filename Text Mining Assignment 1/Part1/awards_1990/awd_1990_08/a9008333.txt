Abstract    :
              This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two                
              years.  This project is entitled " A Genetic Analysis of                       
              Rhizobium meliloti-Alfalfa Symbiosis".  The research Fellowship                
              in Plant Biology are granted to applicants trained in traditional              
              areas of plant biology who wish to extend their training in new                
              techniques and to those trained in molecular or cellular                       
              techniques who wish to gain experience working with plants.                    
              These fellowships are designed to increase the number of                       
              outstanding  young scientists in plant biology.
