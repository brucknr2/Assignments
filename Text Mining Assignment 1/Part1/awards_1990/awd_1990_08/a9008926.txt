Abstract    :
              Objectives:  This project allows Dr. Sethu Raman of the                        
              Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciencs, North Carolina State              
              University, Raleigh, and Dr. M.P. Singh, Center of Atmospheric                 
              Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India, to                 
              continue collaboration in the study of numerical weather                       
              prediction and air pollution.  Work will continue on 1.                        
              development of a regional weather prediction model to predict                  
              short range monsoon events, 2. storm surge prediction, 3. monsoon              
              boundary layer processes and 4. air pollution.  Emphasis in this               
              research will be on atomospheric turbulence and diffusion.                     
              Improved parameterization schemes for boundary layer physics and               
              cumulus heating will be incorporated into the regional scale                   
              model along with a dynamics initialization scheme.                             
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The two teams have been collaborating in the field of                  
              numerical weather prediction for several years with considerable               
              benefit to both countries and with significant publications                    
              published in international journals.  The two scientists have                  
              strong backing in India for conducting experiments and obtaining               
              important data that may not be readily available otherwise, thus               
              the research is likely to be of benefit to the scientists in the               
              U.S.                                                                           
                                                                                             
              Funding:  This project is being supported under two grants:
