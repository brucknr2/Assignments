Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award will support an artificial                      
              intelligence approach to kinematics and dynamics, including                    
              qualitative analysis of mechanical systems.  Dr. Sacks' system                 
              will infer and describe the functioning of simple machines, made               
              from rigid mechanical parts, based on models of structure and                  
              applicable forces.  One research goal is an extension of Dr.                   
              Sack's 2D phasespace analysis technique to higher dimensions.                  
              The longrange goal is automation of engineering design and                     
              maintenance knowledge.
