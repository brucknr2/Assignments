Abstract    :
              Professor Jackson's group is supported by the Experimental                     
              Physical Chemistry Program in a multifaceted investigation of                  
              ultraviolet multiphoton dissociation processes in small                        
              polyatomic molecules.  This work is attempting to characterize                 
              some of the underlying basic processes that occur in such                      
              complex laser-induced chemical environments.                                   
                                                                                             
              The molecules being investigated, such as acetylene, allene,                   
              and methylacetylene, are being expanded in a pulsed molecular                  
              beam prior to ultraviolet photodissociation.  Product fragments                
              are being analyzed by various techniques.  Quantum state                       
              distributions are determined by laser induced fluorescence and                 
              time-resolved infrared emission measurements.  The angular and                 
              energy distributions of hydrogen atom fragments are being                      
              detected via resonant two-photon pumping to Rydberg levels in                  
              the photodissociation zone, followed by time-resolved detection                
              at a distant ionization zone.  Small diatomic fragments can                    
              also be examined with these time-of-flight techniques.
