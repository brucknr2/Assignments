Abstract    :
                   The research problems in this project belong mainly to four               
              areas:  Stochastic Optimization, Information Theory in Bayesian                
              Analysis, Statistical Analysis in Chaotic Models, and Problems in              
              Merging Micro-data Files.  The stochastic optimization project                 
              is expected to develop a mostly automated and possibly fast                    
              converging algorithm for finding the global minimum of a                       
              complicated function.  The investigations in information theory                
              in the Bayesian analysis area are devoted to the application of                
              various information measures to the development of new theories                
              for choosing the better of the two experiments.  Investigations                
              under Chaos and Statistics pertain to Bayesian statistical                     
              analysis of chaotic nonlinear times series. The development of                 
              statistical theory for file-merging methodology, which is used                 
              heavily in evaluating policy implications by federal agencies, is              
              a continuation of a project supported by NSF in the past.
