Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with investigating the spatio-temporal              
              patterns of current filaments in an electroluminescent                         
              semiconductor.  This is an interesting and novel area of                       
              nonlinear dynamics.  The patterns will be observed with a                      
              metallurgical microscope topped by a CCD camera.  A frame-grabber              
              will digitize the output of the CCD camera and load the image                  
              data into a laboratory micro-computer for subsequent data                      
              analysis.  The system will be able to record images much faster                
              than the expected spiral rotation rate of the filament patterns.               
              Computer simulations will also be undertaken to understand the                 
              nonlinear hebahior of these ac thin film electroluminescent                    
              semiconductor devices.  There is strong theoretical support for                
              this type of work at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at                  
              UCSB.
