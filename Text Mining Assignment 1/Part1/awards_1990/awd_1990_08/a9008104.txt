Abstract    :
              This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Program.                
              This research will study organic compounds which contain carbon                
              atoms that are not directly connected that can still however                   
              interact with each other (so-called through-space bonding).                    
              Dr. Reingold will use this research project as the vehicle to                  
              introduce and to train undergraduate students to chemical                      
              techniques in order to stimulate their interests in a career in                
              science.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Two projects dealing with such through-space interactions will                 
              be studied.  The first project will result in the first                        
              bishomobenzene derivative, a cyclopropyl-capped semibullvalene,                
              which on rearrangement will also provide the first planar,                     
              electronically undisturbed ?8!-annulene.  Along the way, new                   
              approaches to a variety of related molecules will be developed.                
              The second project will provide a family of compounds which                    
              will be the first unambiguous test of the importance of                        
              symmetry considerations when pi systems interact through space.                
              Both projects will further our basic understanding of bonding                  
              in organic chemistry.
