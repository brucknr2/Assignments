Abstract    :
              This award supports an investigation of the age of pollen,                     
              megafloral and vertebrate fossil collections from the Eureka                   
              Sounds Group of the Canadian Arctic.  Attempts to date                         
              collections from Ellesmere Island using magnetostratigraphy                    
              ultimately produced a reliable record but the polarity                         
              sequence was too short for a unique correlation to the                         
              geomagnetic reversal time scale (GRTS).  This project will                     
              sample a 3000m thick interval of co-eval sediments from Axel                   
              Heiberg Island to improve temporal calibration of the                          
              unique Eureka Sound Group biostratigraphic record.//
