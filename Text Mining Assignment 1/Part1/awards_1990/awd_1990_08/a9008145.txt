Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for purchase of                            
              engineering research equipment.  The equipment to be                           
              purchased consists of an optical particle counter, image                       
              analysis system and a fermenter coupled with a probe for                       
              measurement of dissolved-oxygen concentrations.  The                           
              investigators plan to use this equipment in three separate                     
                                                                                             
              projects.  One involves oxidant interactions with mineral                      
              and bio-particles in promoting particle destabilization                        
              and growth during chemical coagulation.  The second deals                      
              with concepts of fractals, fractal geometry and dimensions                     
                                                                                             
              in characterizing biological aggregates and factors                            
              affecting their aggregation.  The third addresses bio-                         
              colloids and conditions and factors that affect their                          
              transport in groundwater flowing through subsurface,                           
              porous media.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this award was submitted in                            
              response to Program Announcement NSF 87-68, Engineering                        
              Research Equipment Grants.  In addition to utility of the                      
              equipment for conduct of the research outlined in the                          
              proposal, the equipment will also add to the educational                       
              capabilities of the Environmental Engineering Program at                       
              the University of Arizona.
