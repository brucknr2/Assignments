Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Because so much of SDSC's user community is not locally resident,              
              a challenge for the center is to provide visualization tools for               
              these remote users.  This need will be addressed by developing                 
              visualization tools for the general case of network-based                      
              environments.  Thus, the software tools that that will be                      
              developed will be structured to use network communications (e.g.,              
              sockets and remote procedures calls) as the method of                          
              communication between a computer and an interactive graphics                   
              display.
