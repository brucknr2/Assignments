Abstract    :
              A procedure will be developed for the analysis of dynamic response             
              and noise transmission of large structural systems of finite length            
              which are composed of discretely periodic units.  The method is a              
              combination of finite elements, transfer matrices and waved                    
              propagation.  The response is treated as superposition of wave                 
              motions using wave reflection (due to changes in the construction              
              pattern) and transmission matrices.  This enables the computations             
              to proceed in the direction of wave propagation only, so that the              
              results are always numerically stable.  The new method can treat               
              long piece-wise periodic stiffened structures of finite length,                
              which is not possible with traditional transfer matrices, because              
              of numerical difficulties.  The method can use the finite element              
              formulation for the periodic units to treat systems of complicated             
              geometries and is expected to be much faster than the finite                   
              elements because the degrees of freedom are reduced.  The method               
              will be used for the prediction of the structure-borne noise                   
              transmission of large flexible structures.  Finally, the method                
              will be used with the stochastic finite element formulation to                 
              reduce computational time, which is an evident problems in                     
              stochastic response as the number of elements increases.
