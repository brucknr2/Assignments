Abstract    :
              This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two                
              years.  This project is entitled "Specifity of Coat Protein-RNA                
              Interactions in Virus Assembly".  The research Fellowships in                  
              Plant Biology are granted to applicants trained in traditional                 
              areas of plant biology who wish to extend their training in new                
              techniques who wish to gain experience working with plants.                    
              These fellowships are designed to increased the number of                      
              outstanding young scientists in plant biology.
