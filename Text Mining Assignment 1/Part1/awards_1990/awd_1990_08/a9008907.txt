Abstract    :
              This is a request for partial funding for a workshop on                        
              "Ultrasound Transducers:  The Next Generation".  The                           
              workshop is to take place on the Duke campus on Sept. 10-                      
              11, 1990.  The workshop is to include leading researchers                      
              both from the U.S. and foreign countries, and will examine                     
              those areas where transducers still hamper full utilization                    
                                                                                             
              of ultrasound technology in biomedical applications.  The                      
              workshop is co-sponsored by the Duke ERC.
