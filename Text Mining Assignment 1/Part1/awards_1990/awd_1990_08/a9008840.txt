Abstract    :
                   The Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History has been an                   
              independent institution dedicated to collections and research                  
              since 1923.  The Museum's Department of Invertebrate Zoology has               
              grown dramatically during the past decade, and its mollusk                     
              collection now comprises nearly 200,000 specimen lots and more                 
              that 1,700 type specimens.  This collection ranks among the                    
              finest in North America, and is one of the exceptional                         
              repositories for mollusks in the region.  The collections will be              
              moving into much larger, newly constructed quarters, and a new                 
              endowed Curatorship has recently been filled with a mollusk                    
              specialist.  Dr. Eric Hochberg, Curator of Mollusks, has crafted               
              a long-range plan for growth and curation of the collection.  The              
              first phase involves installation of new storage cabinets in the               
              recently completed collections building.  The cephalopod                       
              collection that was donated by the Allan Hancock Foundation of                 
              the University of Southern California will be integrated with the              
              rest of the collection.                                                        
                   The proposed improvements to the mollusk collection of the                
              Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History will establish this                    
              institution as a growing center for research and curation.                     
              Researchers in the areas of ecology, biogeography, systematics,                
              and evolutionary biology (to name a few) will be given new and                 
              easy access to important specimen collections.  Natural history                
              collections such as this are indispensable resources in the study              
              of biological diversity.
