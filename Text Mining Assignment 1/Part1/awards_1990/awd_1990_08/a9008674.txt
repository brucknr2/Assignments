Abstract    :
              The Science Career Paths for Minority Students program is a                    
              cooperative effort administered by the University of California,               
              Riverside Graduate Division.  It is designed to attract up to 25               
              students over a five year period from 15 different academic                    
              disciplines in the sciences and social sciences.  It allows them to            
              choose from over 64 ongoing research projects and provides                     
              encouragement to pursue research or university careers.  Support               
              is provided from the summer of their junior year through three years           
              of graduate school with the promise of continued support until                 
              the completion of a Ph.D. at UCR.  Two summer programs following               
              a student's junior and senior years are intensive research                     
              mentorships and preparation for graduate school.  Senior year                  
              research traineeships allow further experience and mentoring from              
              faculty and graduate students.  Upon entry into graduate school at             
              UCR, the student receives three years of fellowship support, including         
              fees and a research/travel allowance.
