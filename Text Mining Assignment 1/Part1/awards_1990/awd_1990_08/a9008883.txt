Abstract    :
                   This grant supports a workshop From Fundamental Fields to                 
              Nuclear Phenomena at Boulder, Colorado September 20-22, 1990.                  
              The overall theme is to focus theoretical attention on a major                 
              issue in nuclear physics - how to relate observed nuclear                      
              properties to the underlying field theory of the strong                        
              interactions (QCD).  The specific topics that will be addressed                
              involve frontier issues in nuclear physics elementary particle                 
              physics and also atomic physics covering problems ranging from                 
              the nature of the nuclear-nucleon interaction to relativistic                  
              many-body systems.
