Abstract    :
              The Synthetic Organic Program and the Biological Oceanography                  
              Program are co-supporting the research of Dr. William H.                       
              Fenical of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the                      
              University of California-San Diego.  This interdisciplinary                    
              research program will explore the natural products chemistry of                
              marine chemical defense.  The program is based upon                            
              collaborative investigations of both the biological and                        
              chemical components of this significant, but poorly known,                     
              adaptation in marine habitats.  Chemical studies of bioactive                  
              natural products, involving the use of new methods in                          
              separation science and organic structure determination, are                    
              combined with experimental ecological studies to illustrate the                
              functions of secondary metabolites in competitive marine                       
              habitats.  The overall goals of this program are to derive new                 
              classes of natural products from marine organisms, to                          
              comprehend the specific roles these compounds play in survival,                
              and to understand how they influence community composition and                 
              structure in tropical marine environments.
