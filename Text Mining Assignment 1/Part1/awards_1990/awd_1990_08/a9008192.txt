Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Rigorous theoretical methods and simulation procedures will be                 
              used to study the details of polymer chain statistics due to                   
              entanglements, interpenetration by another chain, and the                      
              proximity of an interacting surface.  A detailed study of the                  
              collective density fluctuations in a solution of semiflexible                  
              chains will be undertaken to better understand the onset of the                
              isotropic-liquid crystalline phase transition as a function of                 
              chain stiffness.  A study of defects in random and model networks              
              will be undertaken, as well as a study of the dynamic properties               
              of gels.
