Abstract    :
                   The eleventh International Conference on the Application of               
              Accelerators in Research and Industry is to take place in Denton,              
              Texas, November 5, 6, 7, and 8, 1990.  The purpose is to review                
              current research and the wealth of industrial applications that                
              are in progress with accelerators throughout the world.  It                    
              provides a unique forum for scientific and industrial users,                   
              instrumentation designers, and accelerator technologists.
