Abstract    :
              One may define a "time-constrained database" as a database that                
              has strict timing constraints in (a) responding to queries, (b)                
              processing transactions, and in (c) database maintenance. A                    
              "time-constrained query" has the form of "get the information x                
              in no more than t time units". This project deals with the                     
              problem of processing arbitrary time-constrained queries in                    
              centralized and single-user time-constrained databases. Various                
              ways of revising a query into one which has the most                           
              "informative" response and can be evaluated within the given time              
              constraint with a controlled risk of overspending are                          
              investigated. Techniques for fragment selection and risk analysis              
              are introduced.  Semantic query processing techniques to control               
              the query processing times are investigated.                                   
                                                                                             
              The expected outcome of this research is (i) a methodology to                  
              process queries with time constraints, (ii) a prototype time-                  
              constrained database management system and a performance                       
              evaluation using the prototype, and (iii) heuristics about the                 
              use of various options under different data characteristics.                   
              Potential applications of the research results are in those areas              
              where time-critical database processing is important, e.g.,                    
              scientific applications and manufacturing environments.
