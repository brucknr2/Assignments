Abstract    :
                   This project supports research into fundamental problems in               
              condensed matter physics and high energy physics.  The research                
              includes rigorous renormalization group methods in the theory of               
              critical phenomena (self-avoiding walk, percolation, and Coulomb               
              gas).  Other research directions include problems in disordered                
              systems related to the Ising model in a random magnetic field and              
              investigations into the phase structure of supersymmetric field                
              theory models and the way the phase structure is constrained by                
              index theorems.                                                                
                   This project lies in the general area of 'theoretical' or                 
              'mathematical' of physics with emphases on directed polymers in a              
              random environment, the inverse square Ising model, phase                      
              diagrams, and models of quantum field theory important to matter               
              theory and high energy physics.
