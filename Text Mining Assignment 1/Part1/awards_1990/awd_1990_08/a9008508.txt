Abstract    :
              Modern solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)                            
              spectroscopy offers the chemist one of the most powerful tools                 
              available for the study of the physical and chemical properties                
              of materials.  Fundamental knowledge of structure and dynamics                 
              of materials as diverse as biopolymers, resins, coals, and                     
              liquid crystals is accessible by solid-state NMR techniques.                   
              Solid-state NMR studies often complement those carried out                     
              using solution NMR and X-ray analysis. Access to solid-state                   
              NMR is rapidly becoming essential to chemists carrying out                     
              frontier research.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry and Material Research Shared                     
              Instrumentation Programs will help the Department of Chemistry                 
              at the University of California at Irvine, purchase a wide bore                
              300 MHz NMR spectrometer for solid-state NMR studies.  The                     
              areas of chemical reserach that will be enhanced by the
