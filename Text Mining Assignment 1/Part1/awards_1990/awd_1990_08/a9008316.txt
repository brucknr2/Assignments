Abstract    :
              This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two                
              years.  This project is entitled "Genetic Analysis and Molecular               
              cloning of the auxl Gene of Arabidopsis."                                      
                                                                                             
              The research Fellowships in Plant Biology are granted to applicants            
              trained in traditional areas of plant biology who wish to extend               
              their training in new techniques and to those who wish to gain                 
              experience working with plants.  These fellowships are designed to             
              increase the number of outstanding young scientists in plant                   
              biology.
