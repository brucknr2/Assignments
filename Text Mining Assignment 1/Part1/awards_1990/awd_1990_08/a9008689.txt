Abstract    :
                   This award, a Research Planning Grant, supports the work of               
              Dr. Helen Grundman of Massachusetts Institute of Technology on                 
              Hilbert modular varieties of dimension three. Dr. Grundman will                
              make use of the award to broaden her knowledge of number theory                
              and algebraic geometry, and will familiarize herself thoroughly                
              with the existing work on Hilbert modular surfaces in preparation              
              for extending and generalizing this work to three-dimensional                  
              spaces.                                                                        
                   Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                
              century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                    
              century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                      
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                 
              rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                   
              study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.              
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                     
              retains connection to its historical roots.
