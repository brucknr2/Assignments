Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle physics and in                
              cosmology will focus on basic analyses of strings - both the                   
              cosmic strings which may play a role in the clustering of                      
              galaxies and the tiny strings which are models of elementary                   
              particles.  An effort will be made to improve our understanding                
              of the evolution of the cosmic strings, and of the symmetries of               
              the tiny ones.  The cosmic strings are an intriguing possible                  
              explanation for the observed clumping of matter in the universe,               
              and the tiny strings show promise of enabling us to unify the                  
              description of all the fundamental forces, including gravity.
