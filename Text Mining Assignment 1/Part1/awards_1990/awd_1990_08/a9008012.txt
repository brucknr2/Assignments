Abstract    :
              This research is aimed at studying various aspects of resource-                
              bounded defeasible reasoning and the applicability of the                      
              formalism.  The scope of this investigation includes 1.                        
              defeasible reasoning about resource-bounded decisions; 2. control              
              of resource-bounded argument; 3. case-based defeasible reasoning               
              in law and projection from small samples; 4. applications of                   
              existing statistical defeasible reasoning, specifically, to                    
              existing HyperText and Diabetes projects; and 5. mathematics and               
              philosophy of defeasible reasoning.  The research is also                      
              expected to have an impact on such related work as non-monotonic               
              reasoning and logic programming.
