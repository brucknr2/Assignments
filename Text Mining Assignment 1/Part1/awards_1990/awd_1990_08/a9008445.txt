Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with incorporating additional information            
              about the human visual system into the process of synthesizing color           
              for computer graphic images.  The traditional camera model employed in         
              realistic image synthesis will be modified so as to produce an initial         
              representation which is perceptual in nature.  From this higher level          
              representation of the scene a final image is to be created for                 
              whatever display device is being used.  The particular perceptual              
              effects to be investigated during the term of the grant are                    
              adaptation and color spatial acuity.  This work will make it possible          
              to handle scenes with high contrast and/or a large dynamic range, will         
              improve the efficiency with which color calculations are performed in          
              a distributed ray tracer, and will make it possible to reproduce color         
              in a more device independent manner.
