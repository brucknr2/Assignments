Abstract    :
                   This award will provide support to a group from the                       
              University of California, Los Angeles to continue research in                  
              high energy physics.  The aim of the group is to study the                     
              possibility of using hadron colliders as intense source of B                   
              mesons (B factory) for the study of their properties.  For this                
              the UCLA group is planning a test run of a new detector at the                 
              Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN (Switzerland).  The                     
              geometry of the detector uses the fact that the production of B                
              mesons at high energy peaks in the forward backward direction.                 
              The detection of B mesons is done with a large aperture forward                
              spectrometer and with a silicon microvertex detector as                        
              trigger.  New triggering ideas are also proposed in which all                  
              information is derived from real time processing of data from                  
              the silicon microvertex detector.  This silicon trigger will be                
              tested in a run at the SPS collider.  The UCLA group is also                   
              continuing the analysis of data from experiment UA8 at the CERN                
              SPS collider in which the measurement of jets of particles, in                 
              events which contain leading protons, are measured in order to                 
              study the internal structure of the Pomeron.
