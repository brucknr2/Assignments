Abstract    :
              AI planners have traditionally made certainty and simplicity                   
              assumptions which have obscured two important distinctions:  that              
              the time at which a plan is executed differs from the time at                  
              which the plan is built, and that the planning agent's model of                
              the world will differ from the real world.  Relaxing these                     
              assumptions indtroduces the problem of maintaining a planning                  
              agent's world model, which will be both imcomplete and dynamic.                
              A framework for representing and maintaining such a model, has                 
              been developed which takes into account reports from external                  
              sources (e.g. sensors), the agent's proposed actions or plans,                 
              and external forces that may aid or confound those plans.                      
              Extensions to this framework will allow the agent to reason about              
              (1) execution-time reports from sensors, thus allowing it to                   
              detect planning failures and learn from bad predictions, and (2)               
              complex causal structures, thus allowing it to represent more                  
              realistic physical systems (like the ones studied in the                       
              qualitative-physics literature).
