Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective is to investigate the use of fractal geometry                    
              in the characterization of nickel aluminide                                    
              microstructures.  Various nickel aluminides will be                            
              analyzed microscopically using digital imaging techniques,                     
              in combination with the methods of                                             
              multi-fractal geometry to produce a characteristic set of                      
              "multiple-fractal dimensions" for each microstructure.                         
              They can be used for both microstructural prediction and                       
              for relating to macroscopic properties such as yield                           
              strength.  Strong indications of "self-similarity" exist in                    
              nickel aluminide microstructures, thus making them                             
              candidates for fractal analysis, which is based on the                         
              concept of self-similarity.  The information which can then                    
              be related to macroscopic properties such as yield                             
              strength.  This represents a potential vast improvement                        
              over currently used methods which relate yield strength to                     
              only one parameter, namely grain size.
