Abstract    :
              This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two                
              years.  This project is entitled "Biochemical and Molecular                    
              Characterization of the 1,4-Dihydropyridine Receptor from the                  
              Plasma Membrane of Corn".  The research Fellowships in Plant                   
              Biology are granted to applicants trained in traditional areas of              
              plant biology who wish to extend their training in new techniques              
              and to those trained in molecular or cellular techniques who wish              
              to gain experience working with plants.  These fellowships are                 
              designed to increase the number of outstanding young scientists                
              in plant biology.
