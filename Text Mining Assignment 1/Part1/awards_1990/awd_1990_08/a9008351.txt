Abstract    :
              This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two                
              years.  This project is entitled,"Genetic Suppression of detl, an              
              Arabidopsis thaliana Mutant That Develops as a Light-Grown Plant               
              in the Absence of Light".                                                      
                                                                                             
              The research Fellowships in Plant Biology are granted to applicants            
              trained in traditional areas of plant biology who wish to extend               
              their training in new techniques and to those trained in molecular             
              or cellular techniques who wish to gain experience working with                
              plants.  These fellowships are designed to increase the number of              
              outstanding young scientists in plant biology.
