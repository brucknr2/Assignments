Abstract    :
                   Mixed tree plantations and tree-crop combinations with                    
              native species of economic value maybe viable alternatives for                 
              the preservation of native species and to contribute to soil                   
              fertility restoration in degraded areas.  This research will be                
              conducted at Pau Brasil Ecological Station in Porto Seguro,                    
              Bahia, Brazil  (16-23'S, 39-11'W).  The station has a 1000 ha                  
              reserve of Atlantic rain forest, an endangered ecosystem                       
              suffering strong pressure from agricultural expansion; an                      
              arboretum with approximately 40 species from the forest, all                   
              planted in monospecific stands, with similar age and on the same               
              soils; and other experimental pure and mixed-tree plantations.                 
              Preliminary results (June 1989) showed low soil N availability                 
              during early establishment of pure and mixed-tree stands,                      
              possibly with high competition with the soil microflora.                       
              Planning activities will include:  a) to examine species/site                  
              relationships for the species in the arboretum; b) to study                    
              factors controlling N availability in existing pure and mixed-                 
              tree plantations; c) based on this information, to design mixed                
              plantations taking into consideration the potential ameliorating               
              effects of trees on soils, and their nutrient requirements for                 
              complementary use of nutrient resources.  This type of research                
              is broadly important to the field of ecology, and will provide                 
              significant information regarding Conservation of tropical                     
              forests.
