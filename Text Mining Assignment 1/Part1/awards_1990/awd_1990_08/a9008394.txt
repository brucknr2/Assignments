Abstract    :
              Representing a concurrent program as a set of simulating, sequential           
              programs, called serializations, provides (1) a formal foundation for          
              a theory of concurrent program testing. (2) a natural basis for                
              applying the methods and theory of testing sequential programs to              
              concurrent programs, and (3) a system for reproducibly testing                 
              concurrent programs.  This project will investigate methods of                 
              incremental generation of serializations, design a regular language            
              for specifying sets of serializations, and develop an experimental             
              testing environment that incorporates these features.  This                    
              environment will be used to study a hierarchy of test data selection           
              criteria for concurrent programs, in which the degree of communication         
              among a program's tasks is used to define increasingly more stringent          
              criteria.  The criteria use information about how shared objects are           
              accessed in the tasks to establish the degree to which the possible            
              task interactions should be tested.  The study of these criteria will          
              include an evaluation of the complexity of using them, and experiments         
              on their effectiveness at exposing timing dependent errors in                  
              concurrent software.
