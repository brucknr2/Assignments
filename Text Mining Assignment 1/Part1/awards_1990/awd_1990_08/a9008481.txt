Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  The primary objective of this project is to produce an                    
              Austronesian comparative dictionary with between 5,000 and 5,500               
              base entries and about 2,000 additional affixed forms.  Secondary              
              objectives include the creation of an electronically acessible                 
              data-base which can serve a variety of purposes (studies of sound              
              change in particular daughter languages, statistical studies of                
              reconstructed forms, etc.).  Data will be drawn from about 120                 
              attested languages, all of which have been used by the PI in past              
              publications.  For reasons of time the project will be largely                 
              limited to integrating about 220 pages of unpublished pilot study              
              material with various scattered publications and a critical                    
              reassessment of the material in Otto Dempwolff, Vergleichende                  
              Lautlehre des austronesischen Wortschatzes (1938).  The published              
              result will contain well over twice the number of entries in                   
              Dempwolff (1938) in an up-to-date orthography, a reverse English-              
              Austronesian Index, and the following features which are not                   
              found in Dempwolff: 1. affixed forms, 2. an explicit indication                
              of relative time-depth for all etyma, 3. detailed semantic                     
              reconstructions, 4. annotations to the reconstructions, 5. an                  
              appendix of submorphemic roots.  It is anticipated that the                    
              results will be of great and lasting value not only to                         
              Austronesian specialists, but also to long-range comparativists                
              and to social anthropologists and prehistorians interested in                  
              island Southeast Asia and the Pacific.
