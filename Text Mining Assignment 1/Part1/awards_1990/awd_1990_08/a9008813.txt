Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will involve two basic topics of combinatorial               
              geometry, namely polyhedra and configurations.  The principal                  
              investigator will study a general theory for polyhedra in 3-                   
              dimensional space including self-intersecting polyhedra and those              
              with self-intersecting faces.  He will also analyze polyhedra                  
              without self-intersections which have faces which are equivalent               
              under symmetries of the polyhedron.                                            
                   Examples of convex polyhedra in three-dimensional space                   
              include boxes, pyramids, and the shapes of most buildings.  These              
              are convex if they have no indentations and always protrude                    
              outward.  When a convex building has windows, one cannot see the               
              outside of the building through any of these.  For many decades                
              mathematicians have studied convex polyhedra and their many                    
              applications.  The principal investigator will extend many of the              
              results of this earlier work to polyhedra which are not convex.
