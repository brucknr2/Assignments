Abstract    :
                   The solar wind plasma within 20 Ro will be studied using a                
              variety of radio propagation techniques.  This will permit                     
              estimation of the spatial spectrum of density fluctuations, the                
              mean flow velocity, its random component and the orientation of                
              the magnetic field. These measurements will be compared with                   
              optical data, such as white light coronograph, magnetograph, and               
              emission line observations. The basic objectives will be to learn              
              more about the mechanism of coronal heating and the flow of                    
              energy near the critical point, and to study the coronal origin                
              of large scale structures such as fast streams.  Within 20 Ro                  
              earlier observations have shown a rapid increase in random                     
              velocity, excess power in density fluctuations on scales of 10 to              
              300 km,  and density fluctuations which become highly isotropic.               
              This study will measure the acceleration of the particles through              
              the sonic point using multiple antenna intensity scintillations.               
              The spatial anisotropy as a function of spatial scale will be                  
              measured by comparing angular scattering (measured at the VLA)                 
              with phase scintillation (measured with the VLBA). The intensity               
              scintillations will be analyzed to learn the origin of the random              
              velocity component. Finally, observations within 20 Ro can be                  
              compared with surface measurements more accurately than those                  
              further from the sun because the mapping distance is small and                 
              stream-stream interactions are much less important. A study will               
              be made to determine the difference in the flow field between                  
              regions of different magnetic geometry.
