Abstract    :
              This proposal offers new insights into the sources of cooperative              
              behavior in small-group situations involving prisoners' dilemma                
              games.  Previous analyses have explained the behavior either by                
              assuming supplementary incentives or by assuming that cooperators              
              are capable of recognizing defectors.  Both approaches place                   
              substantial demands on human cognitive capacities that appear                  
              unreasonable.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The present approach, in contrast, is based on an alternative                  
              heuristic involving two decisions: (1) whether to participate, and             
              if so,  (2) how to participate.  This approach provides a basis for            
              studying the evolution of cooperative behavior.  The ideas will be             
              tested using a new experimental paradigm that holds particular                 
              promise.  The proposed approach offers advances both theoretically             
              and empirically.  In particular, the results of this research will             
              define conditions under which cooperative behavior tends to breed              
              cooperation.  Because the focus is on cooperation rather than                  
              competition, the proposed research should provide new understanding            
              of small-group behavior.
