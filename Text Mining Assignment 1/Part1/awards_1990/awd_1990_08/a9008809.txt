Abstract    :
              This project will identify the scope of movements to mobilize the              
              homeless in this country, track the movements, and analyze them                
              by comparison with earlier poor people's movements.  The Prin-                 
              cipal Investigator will measure the numbers of people involved,                
              identify precipitants of mobilization across the country, chart                
              regional variations and attempt to identify causes of the varia-               
              tion, and develop categories for classifying the nature and                    
              consequences of mobilization of the homeless.  The project                     
              emphasizes effects of such factors as the proportion of homeless               
              in a city and the relations between organizational structure and               
              strategies of mobilization.  The outcome of the research will be               
              to see similarities between these movements and other types of                 
              social movements, and to predict their future course.
