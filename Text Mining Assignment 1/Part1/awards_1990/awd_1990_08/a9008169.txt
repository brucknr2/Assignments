Abstract    :
              Calorimetry has been extensively used for the study of physical                
              transformations and for the investigation of the kinetics of                   
              both homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reactions.  The                    
              methods is based upon the colligative properties, where the                    
              heat changes of the reactions are monitored.  Calorimetric                     
              measurements are useful in studying catalyst surfaces and                      
              polymers.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Instrumentation Program to the                   
              Department of Chemistry at Florida International University,                   
              an undergraduate institution, will help acquire a Heat Flux                    
              Calorimeter.  The acquisition will enhance the ability of the                  
              Department to educate undergraduate students and will enhance                  
              chemical research in the following areas:
