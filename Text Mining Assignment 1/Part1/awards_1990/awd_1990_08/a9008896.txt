Abstract    :
                   This research will investigate genetic divergence and                     
              phylogenetic relationships among species of the owl monkey,                    
              Aotus.  Owl monkeys are widely distributed in Central and South                
              America.  Until ten years ago it was generally assumed that owl                
              monkeys comprised a single species, A. trivirgatus.  More                      
              recently, however, it has been suggested that the owl monkey                   
              represents at least ten allopatric species which have distinct                 
              geographic distributions and can be distinguished both                         
              phenotypically and genotypically.  Aotus has undergone an                      
              extraordinary amount of karyotypic change with diploid chromosome              
              counts ranging from 46 to 58, but changes in other genetic                     
              characters have not yet been investigated.  This research will                 
              examine mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and several related gene                     
              sequences within and among several karyotypically distinct                     
              species.  This work is important because of the use of the owl                 
              monkey as a model for malarial research, and because of the                    
              unusual nature of chromosomal rearrangements in this genus.
