Abstract    :
              To control a discrete event system, a                                          
              supervisor is introduced which enables and                                     
              disables events in order to prevent                                            
              undesirable behavior, that is, the events that                                 
              violate safety and other constraints.  It is                                   
              proposed that, in some applications, a                                         
              supervisor can take chances by not preventing                                  
              undesirable behavior that has very small                                       
              probability of occurring.  This can lead to                                    
              better performance.  A concise and "logical"                                   
              model is also proposed, which allows us to                                     
              combine controlled systems using conjunction,                                  
              disjunction, shuffle and sequential                                            
              compositions.  Forceful controllers are then                                   
              introduced, which force an event if a given                                    
              condition is true.  Finally, decentralized and                                 
              hierarchical control are formalized.                                           
              Conditions for decentralization will be                                        
              investigated.  If this research is successful,                                 
              it will enhance the applicability of the                                       
              theory of supervisory control to complex                                       
              discrete event systems such as manufacturing                                   
              systems, computer and communication systems.
