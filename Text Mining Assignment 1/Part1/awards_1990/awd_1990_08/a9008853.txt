Abstract    :
              This proposal outlines a valuable new approach to understanding the            
              development of organizational routines.  The ability of groups to              
              convert experience into smoothly performed routines is a major                 
              source of the productive power of organizations.  The process by               
              which learning maps continuing experience into routines, either by             
              reinforcing their existing structure or by transforming them, is               
              a major source of both organizational stability and organizational             
              change.  All this has been common knowledge from studies in the                
              last twenty-five years.  Yet, there has been little progress in the            
              development of a deeper theory of organizational routines and their            
              dynamics.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This proposal analyzes the factors that have blocked progress in               
              understanding routines.  It extends recent developments in modeling            
              cognitive processes to provide important new tools for attacking               
              the problems.  The proposal presents a research program combining              
              computer modeling with laboratory experimentation and describes                
              the results that can be anticipated from a coordinated program of              
              theory development and laboratory research.
