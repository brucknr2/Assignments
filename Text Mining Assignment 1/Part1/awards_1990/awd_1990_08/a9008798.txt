Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will devote her time on this                   
              project to further understanding the role of algebraic machinery               
              in Control Theory.  The purpose of this planning grant is to                   
              conduct research and to retrain, in order that the principal                   
              investigator became an active participant in the Systems Theory                
              community.  Collaboration with Professors Hinrichsen and                       
              Grunewald will be actively developed.
