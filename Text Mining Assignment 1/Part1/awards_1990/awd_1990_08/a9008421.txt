Abstract    :
                   Voice/data integrated multiplexers employed in multimedia                 
              environments and random access networks using the Carrier Sensing              
              Multiple Access protocols continue to be widely used in modern                 
              communications.  Therefore, it is important that they be                       
              understood as completely as possible.  One of the most important               
              problems is to study their time dependent, or transient                        
              performance.                                                                   
                   This project's objectives are:  1) to obtain a theoretical                
              and computational framework to evaluate the transient behavior of              
              stochastic models for these networks, whose parameters may also                
              be stationary or time dependent.  2) To evaluate the transient                 
              performance of voice/data integrated networks and multiaccess                  
              networks, which cannot be found using steady state analysis.                   
              Models to be analyzed are the voice/data integrated switches with              
              movable boundary assignments, network models with more realistic               
              descriptions of packet length arrival processes, multi-packet or               
              multi-active-user arrivals, and the network stability analysis.                
              3)  The design of some dynamic routing and control schemes in                  
              voice/data switches based on their time/dependent behaviors.  4)               
              To generalize the approach to the study of more fundamental                    
              queueing problems.
