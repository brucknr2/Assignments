Abstract    :
              A major topic of study in astronomy concerns the way in which stars            
              are formed from the gravitational collapse of interstellar gas                 
              clouds.  The Principal Investigator (PI) wishes to extend earlier              
              studies supported by the NSF of numerical simulations of proto-                
              star under the mutual influence of gravity and rotation.  The PI               
              will use sophisticated new numerical techniques to compute models              
              in two and three dimensions.  Models will be computed to "follow"              
              this collapse in time, with particular attention to the development            
              of minor density fluctuations which could grow ultimately into                 
              planets or a secondary star.  NSF support will include the purchase            
              of a computer workstation so that movies of simulated collapses can            
              be followed in "real time" over a wide range of test conditions.               
              These results are expected to increase our understanding of how                
              proto-stars lose angular momentum during their collapse and to                 
              define the conditions leading to the formation of two separate                 
              "binary" stars.
