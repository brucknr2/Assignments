Abstract    :
                   Aspects of topology of algebraic varieties, closely related               
              with their arithmetic properties, will be studied.  Particular                 
              emphasis will be on development of new topological invariants                  
              (e.g. various versions of motivic perverse sheafs), and on                     
              structures emerging in conformal field theories (geometry of loop              
              spaces).  This work combines ideas from theoretical physics with               
              others from geometry, using methods which are equally diverse.
