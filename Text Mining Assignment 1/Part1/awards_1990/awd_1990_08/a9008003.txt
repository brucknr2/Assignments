Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Mathematical modelling of complex systems often considers two                  
              general classes of systems analysis, termed linear and non-                    
              linear.  Most biological systems have properties that make them                
              non-linear, which makes them very interesting but at the same                  
              time very difficult to model.  This symposium is designed to                   
              involve engineers and biologists, in considering some of the                   
              current issues and state-of-the-art approaches that can be                     
              useful in both identification and analysis of biological linear                
              and non-linear systems.  This conference will serve as an                      
              important cross-disciplinary fertilization that will have                      
              impact on biology and biomedical engineering, in both basic and                
              applied aspects.
