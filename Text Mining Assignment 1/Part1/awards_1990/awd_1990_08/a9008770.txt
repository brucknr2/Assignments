Abstract    :
              In recent years, noncooperative game theory, and especially Nash               
              equilibrium analysis, has been used in the study of many economic              
              situations.  Along with the many and varied applications has come              
              persistent criticism:     Why or when is equilibrium analysis                  
              appropriate?  Where do equilibria come from?  How does one choose              
              among many equilibria in making predictions?  This project                     
              addresses these questions using two different approaches.  In the              
              first, players are assumed to follow ad-hoc behavioral rules in the            
              spirit of models of bounded rationality.  In the second, the                   
              players' forecasts and behavior are obtained as the solution to a              
              dynamic optimization problem given their exogenous prior beliefs               
              about the opponents' strategies.  A common theme to both parts is              
              that learning need not lead to a Nash equilibrium even when players            
              are long-lived, unless they also engage in a sufficient amount of              
              experimentation.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The learning-based justification of equilibrium analysis developed             
              in this project is a very significant contribution.  It provides               
              a better foundation for widely-used analytic tools, identifies new             
              and promising lines of research in economic theory and motivates               
              research in economic theory with the tests of existing theories in             
              experimental economics.//
