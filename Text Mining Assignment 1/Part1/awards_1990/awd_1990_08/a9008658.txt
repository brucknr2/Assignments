Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an experimental research program designed to answer the                
              following scientific issues:  how the electronic charge density                
              at the surface is modulated by adsorbed impurity atoms, how                    
              modulation of charge density affects the equilibrium distribution              
              of chemical species near surfaces and interfaces, what are site                
              specific binding energies, and how these modulations affect                    
              structure at surfaces.  The experimental techniques being used                 
              field ion microscopy and time-of-flight atom probe.  The main                  
              emphasis of the research is the dynamics and energetics of                     
              surface atomic processes and how they are correlated to the                    
              atomic structures as well as the equilibrium distribution of                   
              chemical species in the near surface and interface layers of                   
              metals, alloys, semiconductors, and their combinations.
