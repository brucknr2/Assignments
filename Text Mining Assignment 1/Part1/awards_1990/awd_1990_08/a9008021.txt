Abstract    :
                   Statistical problems in Bayesian decision theory are the                  
              focus of this research.  The feasibility of applying Gibbs                     
              sampling procedures in the evaluation of multi-dimensional                     
              integrals for nonparametric Bayesian inference will be evaluated.              
              A decision theoretic approach to classical nonparametric                       
              inference will be applied to the problem of estimating the                     
              variance of a distribution. The estimation of medians and                      
              quantiles will also be explored. Multi-parameter estimation using              
              nonsymmetric loss functions will be studied for the general                    
              exponential family as well as the the Poisson distribution.
