Abstract    :
              Professor Wilse Robinson is funded by a grant from the                         
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the role which                
              water and other solvents play in chemical reactivity.  These                   
              studies are extremely important in order to further our                        
              molecular level understanding of chemical reactions which take                 
              place in solution.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Robinson's research is directed toward a better molecular-level                
              structural description of the ultrafast dynamics of solvent                    
              participation in chemical reactions.  The methodology of these                 
              studies will combine picosecond and femtosecond spectroscopies                 
              with intuition gained from supercomputer modeling and pure                     
              theory.  Water as a solvent is a special case, and will be the                 
              focus of much of the research effort.  It is a highly                          
              structured liquid having moderately strong directional bonding.                
              The presence of specific solvent structural moieties in                        
              fundamental ionic reactions involving the proton, the hydroxyl                 
              ion and the electron is indicated.  Perturbations by foreign                   
              cations and anions, by pH, temperature, pressure and by the                    
              addition of other solvents will be elucidated.
