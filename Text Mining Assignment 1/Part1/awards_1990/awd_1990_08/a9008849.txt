Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During the 1930's, the United States Government sponsored large                
              Work Projects Administration (WPA) archaeological research                     
              projects in Eastern and Southeastern Texas.  Many of the                       
              excavated sites were extensive and yielded large numbers of                    
              artifacts.  These are currently housed at the Texas Archeological              
              Research Laboratory (TARL), a unit of the University of Texas at               
              Austin.  Unfortunately, these important materials are poorly                   
              stored.  They are difficult to use for research purposes and in                
              danger of losing their scientific value.                                       
                                                                                             
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Hester and his                   
              colleagues will continue to upgrade collection storage and                     
              documentation.  They will reinventory the materials and check                  
              them against item-by-item lists compiled at WPA central                        
              laboratories.  The artifacts will then be reclassified and                     
              repackaged to prevent damage.  The data will then be entered into              
              TARL's computerized collections management data base.                          
              Accompanying documents will also be properly stored and assessed               
              for possible conservation.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project is important for several reasons.  The WPA                        
              collections constitute an extremely important archaeological                   
              resource which can shed light on the prehistory of the southern                
              United States.  However, because of their poor state of curation,              
              they are extremely difficult to use.  The planned work by Dr.                  
              Hester and staff will remedy this situation.
