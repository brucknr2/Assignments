Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Membrane science and separations are two areas highlighted                     
              recently by the Amundson report as worthy of special attention                 
              in chemical engineering research.  The goal of this Gordon                     
              Conference, which has been held every other year since 1974,                   
              is to bring together researchers working at the leading edge                   
              of membrane science and technology for one week so that they                   
              may present the most recent research findings and discuss the                  
              impact of these findings on the use of membranes in separation                 
              methods.  In the spirit of Gordon Conference in general, we                    
              have organized the 1990 Synthetic Membrane Conference to allow                 
              considerable time for active discussion of each paper.                         
                                                                                             
              This Conference will draw participants from the fields of                      
              engineering, chemistry and physics for the purpose of                          
              discussing the most recent research progress in membrane                       
              science and technology.  It is important that we enable a                      
              significant number of graduate students to attend so that 1)                   
              future leaders of membrane technology are exposed to                           
              pioneering work done in the field; 2) the conference benefits                  
              from the fresh input provided by younger researchers; and 3)                   
              current students in the field of membrane science and                          
              separations are stimulated toward a research career and                        
              possibly toward a faculty position.
