Abstract    :
              This is a request for a network of workstations to aid the                     
              Biomedical Engineering Program to upgrade its computational                    
              capability.  The network will be used by both students and                     
              faculty to develop finite element and other highly                             
              computation-intensive models in biomedical engineering.                        
              There are a large number of projects on a variety topics                       
              (such as cardiac mechanics, lung mechanics, temperature                        
              distribution, cellular metabolism) that would benefit from                     
              the upgraded facility.
