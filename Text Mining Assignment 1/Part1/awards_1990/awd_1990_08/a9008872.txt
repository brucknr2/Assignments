Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nerve cells and glial cells are the major cell types present                   
              within the nervous system.  Glia cells surround nerve cells and                
              constitutes more than half the mass of the nervous system.  The                
              traditional view was that glial cells were just space fillers                  
              between nerve cells, however, with the advent of new                           
              technologies, it has been determined that glia plays a crucial                 
              role in many neuronal processes such as neurogenesis, neural                   
              regeneration and neural function.  Glia have been shown to                     
              interact with nerve cells in complex ways that are essential for               
              the health of the nervous system.  A conferences under the                     
              auspices of the New York Academy of Sciences has been planned to               
              bring together investigators studying in vivo and in vitro                     
              preparations involving vertebrate and invertebrate systems.  The               
              intent of this meeting is to discuss the recent advances in the                
              cell biology and physiology of glial cells and to examine the                  
              most promising lines of future development.
