Abstract    :
              The award will continue this important line of research on the                 
              dynamics of wages and unemployment in labor markets characterized              
              by the disappearance of old jobs and creation of new ones.  This               
              is a dimension of labor market dynamics that has not received                  
              much attention in macroeconomics; yet, it is essential to                      
              analyzing a number of central issues in macroeconomics such as                 
              inflation and price setting and the dynamics of aggregate                      
              employment.  The authors have already developed an explicit model              
              of the flows of workers in labor markets with continual job                    
              creation and job destruction; derived the implied behavior of the              
              major aggregates, unemployment, and job vacancies; and begun                   
              constructing a wage determination model in decentralized markets.              
              This continued research will extend the theoretical models of                  
              labor dynamics and will involve additional empirical work using                
              Canadian employment data which tends to be of higher quality than              
              available US data.  The authors will also continue to analyze the              
              US employment data.  This research is important because it will                
              provide a better basis for understanding the persistance of high               
              unemployment rates which have plagued the US and other developed               
              economies to various degrees over the past twenty years.
