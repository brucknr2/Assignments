Abstract    :
              Risk Sensitive Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)                                 
              control is a modification of the classical LQG                                 
              control technique that incorporates noise-                                     
              induced large deviations of the system state                                   
              into the design specifications.                                                
              The goal of the research is to obtain definite                                 
              results for Risk Sensitive LQG control for                                     
              systems defined on an infinite time interval                                   
              and to establish the relationship between the                                  
              resulting design and existing designs for                                      
              linear systems.                                                                
              The main themes of the research include an                                     
              analysis of the large deviations properties of                                 
              the Risk Sensitive LQG cost functional, design                                 
              of optimal stationary Risk Sensitive LQG                                       
              controllers for completely and partially                                       
              observed systems, analytical evaluation of the                                 
              relationship between Risk Sensitive LQG                                        
              control and H-infinity control and the                                         
              application of stationary Risk Sensitive LQG                                   
              control to important physical control problems                                 
              such as telescope pointing, robot arm pointing                                 
              and airplane landing.                                                          
              The research is expected to result in a new                                    
              design methodology for linear stationary                                       
              stochastic systems that has improved noise                                     
              rejection capabilities as compared to the                                      
              standard LQG design.  An additional potential                                  
              benefit is a new viewpoint from which the                                      
              important H-infinity design methodology can be                                 
              evaluated.
