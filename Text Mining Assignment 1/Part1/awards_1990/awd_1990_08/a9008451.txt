Abstract    :
                   This work is a synthesized approach to the interdisciplinary              
              design of complex engineering systems.  The traditional design                 
              process involves a conceptual design stage which utilizes simple,              
              experience-based methods, along with a preliminary design stage                
              involving intermediate models and finally a detailed design stage,             
              with complex numerical models.  The integration of the various                 
              engineering disciplines takes place almost entirely within the                 
              conceptual design.  This research develops a way of synthesizing               
              these design phases in order to achieve better design integration.             
              The approach combines experienced-based methods with                           
              computationally-based methods, combines simple models with complex             
              models, and combines global approximations with local                          
              approximations.  The objective, besides achieving better and more              
              efficient integrated designs, is the education of numerically-                 
              oriented analysts with design insight.  The research is conducted              
              in the framework of the simultaneous aerodynamics-structures-                  
              control design of aircraft wings.
