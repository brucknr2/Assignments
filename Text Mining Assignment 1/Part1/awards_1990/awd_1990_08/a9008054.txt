Abstract    :
              Microwave polarimetric radars (polarimeters) are just now showing              
              great promise as scientific instruments that are capable of remotely           
              sensing natural surface and volume targets.  The advantages of                 
              polarimetry should extend to higher frequencies as millimeter wave             
              device technology advances.  In particular, millimeter wave                    
              polarimeters will be useful in sensing the fine millimeter-sized               
              features of water, ice, and foliated and unfoliated terrain surfaces.          
              They will also be used to conduct scientific studies of natural volume         
              targets such as rain, snow and cloud cells.  The University of                 
              Massachusetts has developed 95 and 225 GHz polarimeters, which it              
              hopes to use in cooperative research projects with other universities          
              and government agencies.  This Engineering Research Equipment Grant            
              provides funds to reconfigure the 95 GHz polarimeter so that it can            
              accurately measure the scattering behavior of natural surfaces and             
              atmospheric volume targets.  New antennas, an antenna positioning              
              system, and equipment needed to develop an appropriate data                    
              acquisition system are provided, which will be used in a variety of            
              field measurement programs.
