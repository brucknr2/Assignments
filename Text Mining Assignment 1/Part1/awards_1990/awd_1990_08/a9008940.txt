Abstract    :
                   The funds awarded to this proposal will partially defray the              
              travel and living expenses for some of the American                            
              mathematicians who will attend the International Symposium on                  
              Algebraic Topology.  The Symposium will be held at Manchester                  
              University in Manchester, England from July 1 through July 15,                 
              1990.  It is assumed that the Symposium will be attended by the                
              vast majority of the top algebraic topologists from around the                 
              world.  The topics of the Symposium are stable homotopy theory,                
              applications of homological algebra to homotopy theory, the                    
              homotopy theory of classifying spaces, and equivariant homotopy                
              theory.  Some of the funds will be used to help send new Ph.D.'s               
              in algebraic topology to the Symposium.
