Abstract    :
                   The PI will conduct laboratory studies, field tests and                   
              instrument intercomparisons to thoroughly characterize the                     
              static thermal gradient cloud chamber technique for the                        
              measurement of cloud condensation nuclei.  Clearly establishing                
              the level of capability for routine measurements of cloud                      
              condensation nuclei is a high priority and will enable the                     
              routine deployment of such instruments in future field campaigns               
              designed to investigate the effects of marine dimethyl sulfide on              
              cloud condensation nuclei and thus on cloud development and                    
              climate.
