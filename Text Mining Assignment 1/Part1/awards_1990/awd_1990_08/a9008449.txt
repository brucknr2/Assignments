Abstract    :
                   The structure of positronium is governed almost                           
              completely by QED; strong and weak corrections are small                       
              compared to electrodynamic effects.  This makes it an ideal                    
              laboratory for studying QED and the bound state formalism in                   
              quantum field theory.  The objective of the research is to                     
              study the energy levels and decay rates in positronium.  The                   
              emphasis will be on the calculation of order alpha2 corrections                
              to these energy levels and decay rates and to complete the                     
              evaluation of the n=1 and n=2 positronium energy levels through                
              order m*alpha2.  Completion of these calculations will provide                 
              an important test of the bound state formalism and QED.
