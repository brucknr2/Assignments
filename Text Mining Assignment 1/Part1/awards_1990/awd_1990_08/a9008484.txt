Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is a "Research Opportunity for Women / Research                  
              Planning Grant" pilot project by a young cultural anthropologist               
              who will study a low-caste village in Sri Lanka to examine the                 
              village-level consequences of radical changes in the national                  
              economy of this developing state. The investigator has done                    
              research in this village before and the pilot study will allow                 
              her to apply macro-level economic theory to this micro-case of                 
              development.  The specific issues to be examined are to explain                
              the villages apparent economic development in an environment of                
              economic hardship.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This project is important because it supports the scientific                   
              research of a young woman investigator, and helps her develop her              
              potential for doing large-scale scientific research.  The topic                
              of explaining variation in the economic development of poor                    
              developing-country villages is an important one, as only by                    
              examining and understanding the successful cases of local-level                
              village development can we help planners develop policies to                   
              stimulate thus development on a broad scale.
