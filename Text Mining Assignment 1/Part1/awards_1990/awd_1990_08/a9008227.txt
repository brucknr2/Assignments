Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project                    
              between Dr. Donald Darensbourg of Texas A&M University and                     
              Dr. F. Joo of Kossuth Lajos University, Debrecen, is to study                  
              the use of aqueous solutions as a media for reactions                          
              catalyzed by organometallic complexes.  The researchers will                   
              use transition metal complexes with sulphonated tertiary                       
              phosphine ligands in these efforts.  Their examination will                    
              focus on ligand exchange processes, hydrogen transfer                          
              reactions and interaction of carbon oxides, especially carbon                  
              dioxide.  Results should contribute to our understanding of                    
              the effects one may expect when water is used as a solvent in                  
              organometallic catalytic processes.                                            
                                                                                             
              This project in organometallic chemistry fulfills the program                  
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                     
              combine complementary talents and pool research resources in                   
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
