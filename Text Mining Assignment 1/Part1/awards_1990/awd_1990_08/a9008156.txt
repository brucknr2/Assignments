Abstract    :
                   One faculty member together with undergraduate students                   
              will collaborate with others on research in elementary particle                
              physics.  Experiment E672 at Fermilab has as its goal to test                  
              the predictions of the currently favored theory of the strong                  
              interactions, quantum chromodynamics, by studying the reaction                 
              products emerging from collisions between the basic                            
              constituents of matter, quarks and gluons.  In addition to                     
              particle physics, the project offers the opportunity to                        
              establish a research program  at a predominantly undergraduate                 
              institution and enable students to gain experience in forefront                
              research.
