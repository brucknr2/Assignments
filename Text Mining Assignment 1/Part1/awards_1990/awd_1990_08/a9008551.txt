Abstract    :
              Dr. Eric Chronister is supported by a grant from the                           
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study fast dynamical                
              processes which occur in molecular solids at extreme pressures.                
              These experiments will provide important information on how                    
              chemical reactions are influenced by conditions of extreme                     
              pressure at very low temperatures.                                             
                                                                                             
              In this project Chronister will utilize high pressure and                      
              time-resolved coherent spectroscopies to study details of solid                
              state intermolecular interactions which cannot be obtained by                  
              other means.  Although temperature provides the energy for a                   
              system to move on a potential energy surface, the effect of                    
              increased density is very different since it influences the                    
              shape of the potential energy surface.  Chronister's research                  
              will be useful in developing dynamic theories of optical                       
              dephasing, vibronic relaxation and inhomogeneous coherence                     
              loss, all of which are controlled by the shape of the                          
              intermolecular potential energy function.  Since no high                       
              pressure studies of relaxation dynamics of molecular solids at                 
              low temperature have yet been done, Chronister will begin with                 
              detailed studies of pure and mixed crystal systems as well as                  
              some novel molecular solids.
