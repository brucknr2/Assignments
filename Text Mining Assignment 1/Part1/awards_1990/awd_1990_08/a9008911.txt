Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports an international workshop in three                         
              areas of condensed matter physics: surfaces, thin films                        
              and small particles.  The U.S. organizers are Adolfo                           
              Eguiluz of Montana State University and Fernando Ponce                         
              of Xerox Corporation, along with five others from                              
              countries other than the U.S.:  Mexico, Germany,                               
              Colombia and Brazil.  The Peruvian organizers are from                         
              Lima and Cusco: M. Horn, V. Latorre, E. Lopez-Carranza                         
              and E. Gil.  In addition, there is an International                            
              Advisory Committee with members from countries throughout                      
              Central and South America as well as from the U.S.,                            
              Spain, France and Italy.  Forty contributions have been                        
              invited out of a total submission of 150 abstracts                             
              indicating wide interest and participation on the part                         
              of Latin American physicists and others from the U.S.                          
              and Europe.  Some of the papers are the result of                              
              ongoing U.S.-Latin American collaborations.  The                               
              proceedings will be published by an international                              
              publisher as have those of previous such symposia.                             
                                                                                             
              The workshop will consist of oral presentations in                             
              addition to poster sessions.  The topics include atomic                        
              and electronic structure of metallic and semiconductor                         
              surfaces, interaction with radiation, physics, and                             
              chemisorption, quantum effects, magnetism and applications                     
              to catalysis and corrosion.  In keeping with the goal of                       
              fostering mutilateral collaborations, a round-table                            
              session will be held to highlight the main themes of the                       
              workshop, make recommendations of future research                              
              directions and to organize preliminary arrangements of                         
              collaborative projects that have developed during the                          
              workshop.
