Abstract    :
                   This research establishes a formal methodology for                        
              designing and implementing highly interactive systems that is                  
              based on knowledge of both application programs and interface                  
              software.  To demonstrate feasibility, it the methodology is                   
              applied to systematically resolve design and implementation                    
              trade-offs between the conflicting goals of supporting highly                  
              interactive graphic interfaces and achieving maximum separation                
              between user interface software and application programs.  The                 
              methodology replaces traditional partitioning of the development               
              task with partitioning of the interactive system.  Mechanisms                  
              progressively transform design information from an initial                     
              description of interaction requirements to components of the                   
              software interface between the user interface and application.                 
              These mechanisms capture the knowledge required to build this                  
              interface.  A design information representation describes the                  
              information required to resolve separation trade-offs.  These                  
              results are implemented as a tool that demonstrates the                        
              methodology.
