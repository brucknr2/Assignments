Abstract    :
              This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                 
              Chemistry Program will support a study of the gas-phase                        
              chemistry of transition metal complexes for which the solution                 
              chemistry is already well-known. The study is expected to                      
              provide valuable information about the role of the solvent in                  
              solution-phase reactions of these substances.                                  
                                                                                             
              Gas-phase ion techniques, especially Fourier transform ion                     
              cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, will be used to study                   
              the reactivity and thermodynamic properties of coordinatively                  
              saturated or near-saturated metal complexes which exist also as                
              stable molecules or ions in the condensed phase. These                         
              experiments will both address fundamental questions regarding                  
              the intrinsic chemistry of such systems and provide insight                    
              into the effect of solvation on reactivity and thermochemistry.                
              Classes of complexes to be investigated include: (1) early                     
              transition metal electrophilic cations of titanium, zirconium                  
              and hafnium, (2) organometallic and coordination complexes that                
              have reversible one-electron changes, (3) electrophilic agostic                
              complexes of cobalt(III) and rhodium(III), and (4) early                       
              transition element alkylidene and alkylidyne complexes. To                     
              provide improved thermodynamic data infrared multiphoton                       
              dissociation techniques will be entended to new wavelength                     
              ranges, and temperature control of ion cyclotron resonance                     
              spectrometry will be developed.
