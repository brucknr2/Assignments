Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in algebraic geometry of                 
              Professor Ron Donagi of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr.                    
              Donagi's project is concerned mostly with the moduli of vector                 
              bundles on a curve, but he will also spend time investigating                  
              algebraically completely integrable systems and the Schottky                   
              problem.                                                                       
                   Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern                   
              mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in                
              the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that               
              could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely                
              polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only                  
              from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is                
              finding application in those fields as well as in physics,                     
              theoretical computer science, and robotics.
