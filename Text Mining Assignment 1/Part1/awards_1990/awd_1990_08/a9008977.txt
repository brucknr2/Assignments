Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to analyze the macroeconomic                   
              consequences of credit market imperfections and examine the                    
              channels through which monetary policy affects real economic                   
              activity.  In previous research, the authors have identified                   
              episodes when the Federal Reserve undertook major shifts in                    
              monetary policy out of a desire to reduce inflation.  Because                  
              these policy changes were essentially independent of real                      
              economic developments, they can be used to disentangle the                     
              effects of monetary policy, and the mechanisms through which                   
              those effects occur, from the effects of real economic                         
              developments on financial variables.  In particular, the                       
              information provided by these episodes will be used to test                    
              between theories in which the impact of monetary policy on the                 
              money stock is central to the transmission mechanism and theories              
              in which it is the impact on lending by financial intermediaries               
              that are central.  This research is important because it will                  
              provide a better understanding of the role that credit market                  
              imperfections may play in causing or contributing to                           
              macroeconomic fluctuations.
