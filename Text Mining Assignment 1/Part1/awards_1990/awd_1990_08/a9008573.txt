Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project provides international travel support for                         
              development of trilateral cooperative research in frontiers                    
              of constructed facilities between the U.S.A., Japan, and                       
              Korea.  A workshop program will be formulated to rivet                         
              attention of research communities on the directions for new                    
              research in emerging technologies for advanced constructed                     
              facilities.  The topic areas to be examined include new                        
              materials, smart structures, super large-scale structures,                     
              underground facilities, structural evaluation techniques,                      
              experts systems, etc.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Considerable common interests exist in these areas for                         
              possible joint research efforts in developing new frontiers                    
              of construction and natural disaster mitigation measures in                    
              connection with the new constructed facilities. At a time when                 
              there is a great urgency to revitalize the U.S. technology in                  
              construction and to restore the industry's competitiveness and                 
              leadership, the collaboration with Japan and Korea, both                       
              leaders in the field, is both timely and strategically                         
              meritorious.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This effort will lead to a comprehensive future research                       
              agenda in advanced constructed facilities research and                         
              practical ways to implement these programs by way of                           
              international cooperation.
