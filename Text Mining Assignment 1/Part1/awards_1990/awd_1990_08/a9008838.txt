Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Dr. Wesley G. Bentrude at the University of                 
              Utah.  The investigation will result in an improved                            
              understanding of the fundamental processes involved in                         
              reactions of organic phosphorus compounds.                                     
                                                                                             
              The experiments to be carried out by Dr. Bentrude will focus on                
              photochemical and free radical reactions of both tricovalent                   
              and pentacovalent organophosphorus derivatives.  Efforts will                  
              be aimed at gaining a new understanding of the reactions of                    
              intact tetracovalent phosphoranyl radicals.  Spectroscopic and                 
              product studies will be employed to define the scope,                          
              mechanism, and structure-reactivity patterns of reactions in                   
              which these radicals lead to structurally novel products.
