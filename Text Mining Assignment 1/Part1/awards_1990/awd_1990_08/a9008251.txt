Abstract    :
                   The PI seeks support for an investigation of a novel theory               
              to investigate the role of the hippocampus in learning and                     
              memory.  Specifically, that the hippocampal formation provides                 
              the neural substrates that enables an animal to construct a                    
              representation of the joint occurance of two or more stimulus                  
              elements.  An important point of this theory is that it allows                 
              the explanation of how animals can solve problems that require                 
              non-linear solutions.  In another words, it allows animals to                  
              solve problems that cannot be solved by a learning system that                 
              simply algebraically sums the associative strengths of the                     
              individual cues that compose a stimulus.  This is an interesting               
              proposal by an innovative and highly productive investigator.                  
              The proposed research is a gamble and there is a minimum of                    
              preliminary data to allow an easy judgement.  However, the                     
              investigator has made excellent progress and is now at a stage of              
              his research where a definitive decision on the validity of the                
              configural association theory can be made.  The potential for a                
              significant outcome seems sufficient to justify the risk.  This                
              work has the potential to move behavioral neuroscience                         
              significantly closer to an understanding of the neural systems                 
              that underlie learning and memory.
