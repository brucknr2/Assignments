Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to explore how reflected                           
              visible and infrared laser light may be used to explore                        
              tissue structures below the skin surface.  The study will                      
              examine light reflections at multiple wavelengths and at                       
              multiple depths using mathematical simulations, ex vivo                        
              biological samples, and human subjects.  If successful,                        
              this project will open up a new way of noninvasively                           
              examining layered biological tissue structure, including                       
              blood and oxygen concentrations.
