Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Cardiovascular disorders are the leading medical cause of                 
              disability and deaths in the United States.  For example,                      
              systemic arterial hypertension afflicts approximately 20% of the               
              adult population, and is the prime cause of congestive heart                   
              failure, stroke, and renal disease.  It is known that the lower                
              brain stem, particularly its medulla oblongata portion, plays a                
              primary role in the central governance of vital visceral                       
              functions.  Hence, Dr. Hirsch will concentrate his research                    
              efforts on neurons within this important brain region.  Using                  
              innovative chemical neuroanatomical and physiological                          
              methodologies, he will determine which population of medullary                 
              cells synthesize and co-localize the neurotransmitters                         
              thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and serotonin (5-HT).  In                  
              addition, Dr. Hirsch will determine how these chemical messengers              
              differentially regulate peripheral arterial blood pressure, heart              
              rate, and glandular release of adrenaline-related hormones.  The               
              long-term goals of his multidisciplinary program is to provide                 
              the basis research necessary for the development of novel                      
              medicinal pharmaceutical agents to ameliorate these crippling and              
              life-threatening human illnesses.
