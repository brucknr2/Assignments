Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is concerned with the use of coupled vibrational                 
              stirring during the growth of crystals.  The technique is non-                 
              invasive, and works on the principle of removal of unwanted                    
              species segregating at the growth interface, thereby leading to                
              improved uniformity of chemical composition of the growing                     
              crystal.  The research examines the fluid dynamic aspects of the               
              technique and its aplication to the Bridgman crystal growth                    
              process.  Two specific areas are being emphasized:  (1) effects                
              of the technique on rate of growth, shape of the growth                        
              interface, chemical homogeneity, and formation of deffects,  (2)               
              parametric study of the mass and thermal transport during crystal              
              growth, inclufing thermal gradients and thermal ossilations.  THe              
              materials systems being studied incllude cesium cadmium chloride,              
              cadmium telluride, germanium, and silver gallium selenide.
