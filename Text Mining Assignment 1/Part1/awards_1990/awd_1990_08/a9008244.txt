Abstract    :
              Components are acquired for the construction of an experimental                
              facility to perform temperature-programmed desorption (TPD),                   
              temperature-programmed oxidation (TPD), and temperature-                       
              programmed reduction (TPR).  These are assembled into a working                
              unit.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The apparatus will be used in ongoing studies of the partial                   
              oxidation of methane to methanol and formaldhyde over molybdena-               
              based catalysts, synergy between manganese and molybdenum oxides               
              in the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, and selective                        
              reduction of nitrogen oxides with ammonia over vanadia                         
              catalysts.
