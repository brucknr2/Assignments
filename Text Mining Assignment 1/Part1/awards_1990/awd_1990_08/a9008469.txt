Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two problems in dislocation dynamics are under study, tunneling                
              of a dislocation (how it occurs) and a dislocation model for                   
              martensite phase transformations.  In both cases detailed                      
              ultrasonic measurements are employed to examine the structural                 
              changes that occur during the process.  The first part is an                   
              attempt to define the conditions under which tunneling of                      
              dislocations through pinning points can occur in dilute                        
              superconductor alloys as a function of impurity segregation to                 
              dislocations.  If definitive evidence of tunneling is found, it                
              can be used to test current theories of the effect of viscosity                
              on tunneling of macroscopic systems.  The second part is an                    
              attempt to obtain parameters for a detailed dislocation model for              
              the martensite transformation in cobalt, which involves a change               
              from the face-centered cubic structure to hexagonal close-packed               
              structure.  In this research ultrasonic measurements are ideally               
              suited for examination of the mechanisms involved because of the               
              sensitivity available for small structural changes, the                        
              discrimination possible from polarization dependence                           
              measurements, and the fact that the technique measures dynamic                 
              aspects of dislocation behavior.
