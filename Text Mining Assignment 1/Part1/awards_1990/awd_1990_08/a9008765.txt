Abstract    :
                   This proposal addresses the major questions of how offspring              
              survivorship and competitive ability  influence adult                          
              reproductive behavior in certain species of neotropical insects                
              whose larvae develop in water-filled treeholes.  Because these                 
              species use the same limiting resource (i.e. treeholes), and                   
              females are predictably found in light gaps, differences in                    
              mating systems cannot be fully explained in terms of the                       
              distribution of reproductive resources (the traditional                        
              paradigm).                                                                     
                   The discrete nature of the larval habitat allows assessment               
              of success in terms of the relative number of offspring surviving              
              to emergence.  Although previous research in Panama suggests that              
              predation among larvae render territorial defense ineffective for              
              some species, experimental confirmation of this result is needed.              
              If the working hypotheses are supported, this study will be one                
              of the first to demonstrate a role of interspecific competition                
              in the evolution of mating systems.
