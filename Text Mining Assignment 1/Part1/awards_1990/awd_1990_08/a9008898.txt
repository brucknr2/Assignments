Abstract    :
              This project will compare the genomes of wheat and barley. It is               
              already known that many of the expressed genes are similar and even            
              in the same linkage groups. The non-expressed genome is much more              
              variable between the two, however. In this proposal low copy number            
              and highly repeated sequences will be compared using both Southern             
              hybridizations and in situ hybridizations. The results will reveal             
              information about the evolutionary divergence of wheat and barley.             
              It will also provide information helpful in generating mapping                 
              strategies for these important cereal crops.
