Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to purchase a rheometer capable of making                       
              steady, transient, and dynamic rheological measurements of                     
              polymer solutions.  This equipment would support research                      
              in liquid crystals, polyelectrolytes, characterization of                      
              novel polymers, aggregation phenomena in nitrocellulose and                    
              hydrozpropyl lignins, and ionomers used as elastomers.                         
              These materials have complex rheological behavior including                    
              shear rate- and time-dependent viscosity and elasticity.                       
              In order to characterize these microstructures in their                        
              unpreturbed state, it is essential to make rheological                         
              measurements at very low stress levels.  These materials                       
              such low viscosities and storage and loss moduli that                          
              extremely sensitive torque transducers are needed.                             
              Rheological measurements with the proposed equipment serve                     
              two purposes.  First, one can relate a polymer's                               
              microstructure to specific rheological properties,                             
              providing guidance on how to alter the molecular structure                     
              of a polymer to obtain a desired property.  Secondly, one                      
              can determine the optimum processing conditions for                            
              obtaining desired properties.
