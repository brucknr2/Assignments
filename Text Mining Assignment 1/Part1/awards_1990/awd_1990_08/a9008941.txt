Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Partial support is being provided for the detailed design of a                 
              long-baseline, multiple-telescope interferometer array operating               
              at visible wavelengths.  This award follows a four-year feasibility            
              and design concept effort.  A cooperative venture between Georgia              
              State University's Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy                
              (CHARA) and the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) of the                  
              Georgia Institute of Technology, the CHARA Array will consist of               
              seven 1-m aperture telescopes in a VLA-type configuration contained            
              within a circle of 400 m diameter.  The Array will provide a                   
              limiting resolution of 0.2 milliarcsec.  The primary scientific                
              program will be directed at the fundamental astrophysics of single             
              and multiple stars, but the Array will be applicable to problems               
              in all areas of contemporary astronomy.  A significant fraction of             
              observing time will be open to the U.S. astronomical community with            
              an emphasis on developing methods for very high resolution imaging             
              of broad classes of extended objects.  Thus the CHARA Array will               
              serve as a prototype for next-generation imaging arrays built as               
              national facilities on the ground and in space.
