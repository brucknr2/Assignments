Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is to identify and study the               
              involvement of certain nervous system mechanisms in the ability                
              of the organism to adapt to changes in the environment.  Of                    
              particular significance are those adaptations that result from                 
              the learning of new information.  The work will focus on the                   
              fundamental unit of information processing in the nervous system               
              - the single nerve cell.  This research will aid in elucidation                
              of how certain chemically and electrically based cellular                      
              processes are related to lasting modification of nervous system                
              function.  This work, in turn, will be important for                           
              understanding mechanisms that are related to the acquisition of                
              learned behaviors.
