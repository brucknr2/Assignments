Abstract    :
                   A broad program of research in theoretical gravitational                  
              physics will continue at the University of California, Santa                   
              Barbara.  This effort will touch most theoretical aspects of                   
              gravitational physics.  In classical gravitation this group will               
              study gravitational collapse, the generation of gravitational                  
              waves, the dynamics of black holes, and tests of general                       
              relativity.  In cosmology, continued studies of possible quantum               
              initial conditions for the universe will correlate observations                
              today on large, and perhaps even small scales.  In quantum                     
              gravity, fundamental studies of string theory, topological                     
              quantum field theory, and wormholes, will be continued.
