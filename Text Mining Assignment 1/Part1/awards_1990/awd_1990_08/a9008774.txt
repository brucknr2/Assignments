Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Intracellular free calcium ions act as second messengers in                    
              numerous physiological process in virtually all types of cells.                
              One transport system that is involved with the regulation of                   
              cellular calcium is the sodium/calcium exchange system which is                
              recognized as one of the fundamental mechanisms through which the              
              intracellular ionic environment is maintained constant.                        
              Electrophysiological and molecular biological techniques have                  
              been used to study the sodium/calcium exchanger, providing more                
              information on the properties and physiological roles of the                   
              exchanger in cells.  A conference, under the auspices of the                   
              New York Academy of Sciences, has been planned to assemble                     
              investigators from various disciplines of science to discuss and               
              share new information on the mechanisms that help regulate                     
              calcium in cells.
