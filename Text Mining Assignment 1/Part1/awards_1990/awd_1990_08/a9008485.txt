Abstract    :
              A three year program of research is                                            
              proposed on a new class of majority                                            
              carrier optoelectronic devices based                                           
              on a recently developed technique                                              
              for making electrical contact to the                                           
              deep InAs quantum well in

              devices all operate on intersubband                                            
              electronic transitions between the                                             
              conduction band levels of a single
