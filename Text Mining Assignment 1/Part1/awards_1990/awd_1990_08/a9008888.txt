Abstract    :
              The objective of this work is to prepare a comprehensive                       
              historical review of research on machining and grinding in the                 
              United States covering the period from the seminal and pioneering              
              research of F.W. Taylor in 1905 to 1980.  Its primary purpose                  
              will be to serve the needs of the National Science Foundation                  
              personnel who have responsibility for the planning and guidance                
              of the funding of research in this field of engineering.
