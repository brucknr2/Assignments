Abstract    :
                   The investigator's previous work on structural                            
              polymorphisms, on the one hand, and recursive types over CPO-                  
              categories, on the other hand, will be synthesized.  Both                      
              semantic and syntactical aspects will be considered.                           
                   Categorical algebra was once considered the most abstract                 
              and least likely candidate for applications, but recent                        
              developments show promise of shedding light on the semantics of                
              programming languages.
