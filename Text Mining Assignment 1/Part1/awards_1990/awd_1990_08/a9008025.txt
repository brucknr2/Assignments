Abstract    :
              The new generation of large telescopes will require large                      
              diffraction gratings in their spectrographs.  These gratings will              
              need to be significantly larger than those currently available.                
              The limiting factor in ruling large gratings is the lifetime of                
              the ruling diamond, which depends on the coating deposited on the              
              blank for the ruling.  This award will support a program of                    
              research by a very well respected company, that is experienced in              
              ruling gratings for astronomical use, into new coatings for the                
              next generation of diffraction gratings.
