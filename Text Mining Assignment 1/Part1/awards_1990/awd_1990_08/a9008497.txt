Abstract    :
                   With this award the principal investigators will study                    
              various problems in the mathematical theory of continuum                       
              mechanics.  In particular, they will investigate the well-                     
              posedness of certain boundary value problems that describe the                 
              flows of visco-elastic fluids and the free-surface flows of                    
              Newtonian fluids such as water.  These are difficult problems                  
              that involve "open" inflow and outflow boundaries, and the nature              
              of the boundary conditions determine the well-posedness of the                 
              problem.  A precise determination of the types of boundary                     
              conditions that lead to well-posed problems is one of the major                
              goals of the research.                                                         
                   The behavior of many fluids in nature is very often a direct              
              result of the state of the fluid and the forces acting upon it                 
              along the boundary of the flow regime.  These so-called boundary               
              conditions can be of many different types, but only the                        
              physically relevant ones are of interest to scientists and                     
              mathematicians.  In a mathematical context a physically relevant               
              boundary condition is one that leads to a unique solution of the               
              underlying system of differential equations.  With this award the              
              researchers will study what types of physically relevant boundary              
              conditions are possible in various flows of ordinary fluids like               
              water and more complicated visco-elastic fluids.
