Abstract    :
                   Research involves the exploration of the use of multi-                    
              dimensional cubic spline approximations in the context of                      
              continuous-state dynamic programming emanating from multi-echelon              
              inventory/distribution problems.  New theoretical and computational            
              results should result, as well as a better understanding of when               
              spline approximations are appropriate.
