Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a renewal grant for a theoretical program studying the                 
              structure and excitations of low dimensional systems.  The systems             
              studied in this program are quasi-one-and-two dimensional systems              
              including the conducting polymers, two dimensional strongly                    
              correlated lattice fermion systems relevant to the superconducting             
              oxides, the organic charge transfer salts, and the alkalides which             
              represent a new class of synthetic Mott insulators.  We will                   
              explore the low energy physics in these systems which leads to                 
              structures with broken translational symmetry, and particularly                
              phenomena which can lead to modulated or incommensurate structures             
              in the ground state. The structure of these novel states of matter             
              and their low lying excitations will be studied.//
