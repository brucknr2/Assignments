Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The nature of structural relaxations during the glass                          
              formation process will be investigated using the viscous                       
              behavior of liquid oxide systems using the Brillouin light                     
              scattering technique.  A signal in the GHz frequency range,                    
              related to a complex modulus, allows direct study of                           
              viscoelastic relaxation on an atomistic scale.  Processes                      
              which reflect in the Brillouin spectrum include cooperative                    
              vibrations of larger molecular units, structural                               
              rearrangements involving bond breaking and reorientations                      
              and momentum exchange between diffusing particles.  No                         
              mechanical coupling is necessary between the probe and the                     
              investigated substance, which eliminates some of the                           
              difficulties of high temperature measurements and                              
              facilitates the study of viscoelastic phenomena in the                         
              glass transition region.  The fundamental relation between                     
              the experimental observations and the structural                               
              characteristics of glass.forming liquids is elucidated by                      
              complementary numerical simulations.
