Abstract    :
              Further work is proposed to study the effect of disorder and                   
              reduced dimensionality on phase transitions in 4He.  Liquid                    
              helium confined by porous media and as a thin film on a graphite               
              surface will be studied at 10mK, 300mK, 2K and 4K using heat-                  
              capacity, third-sound, vapor-pressure-isotherm and light-                      
              scattering techniques.
