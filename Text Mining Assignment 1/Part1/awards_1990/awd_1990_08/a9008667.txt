Abstract    :
              Components are acquired to upgrade a crude molecular-beam                      
              apparatus to permit direct observation of surface kinetics and                 
              to allow the study of weakly adsorbed species. After the                       
              upgrade, the apparatus will be close to the state of the art.                  
                                                                                             
              The apparatus will be used in the experimental tests of the                    
              investigator's theory of structure-sensitivity of surface                      
              reactions and for the study of metal-organic chemical vapor                    
              deposition.
