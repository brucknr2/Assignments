Abstract    :
                   Gymnolaemates are a class of bryozoans, which comprise a                  
              phylum of colonial organisms that inhabit freshwater and marine                
              environments.  Dr. Russell Zimmer has discovered a previously                  
              overlooked pattern of cell development (the "inter-coronal                     
              cells") in the larvae of gymnolaemates, and he proposes a survey               
              of these cells as they occur in different gymnolaemate groups.                 
              Differences among cell types and their pattern of development                  
              will help to discriminate species, and to reconstruct their                    
              evolutionary relationships.  The results based on cell                         
              development patterns will be synthesized with those based on data              
              from adult and fossilized specimens.                                           
                   The proposed project will find an interested audience among               
              invertebrate zoologists, and developmental and evolutionary                    
              biologists.  A better understanding of bryozoan diversity and                  
              evolutionary relationships will form the basis for research in                 
              ecology, marine biology, biogeography, and cell biology.
