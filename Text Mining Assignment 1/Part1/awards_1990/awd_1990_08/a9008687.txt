Abstract    :
              This proposal for a Research Planning Grant examines adaptation in             
              the training and development within organizations.  Changes in the             
              demographic composition and the skill/knowledge base of the labor              
              force suggest that organizaitons will need to focus more of their              
              management activities on training and development.  These changes              
              also suggest that organizations will need to take an interactionist            
              approach to training, i.e., adapting the training method or content            
              to meet the needs and aptitutes of individduals in the workforce.              
              Little research has been done in organizational training                       
              environments on how to adapt training in this fashion.                         
                                                                                             
              Research in cognitive psychology and education provides a                      
              foundation for theoretical work in this area.  This research                   
              suggests that aptitudes andmethods do interact and can enhance                 
              performacne both for individuals and for organizations.  The                   
              planned research involves building on the research in cognitive                
              psychology and education, developing theoretically-based                       
              hypotheses, and proposing a series of studies to test these                    
              research hypotheses.  In the long run, this investigation will lead            
              to insights into adaptive approaches to training and development.
