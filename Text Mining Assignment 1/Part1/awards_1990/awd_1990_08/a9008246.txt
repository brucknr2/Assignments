Abstract    :
              Dr. Micheal A. Duncan is supported by a grant from the                         
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study gas phase                     
              laser vaporization using beams of molecules. These experiments                 
              investigate unusual atomic arrangements which can give rise to                 
              previously unknown chemical bonds which, in turn, may well                     
              allow the production of highly efficient molecular energy                      
              stores.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Ionized clusters of the lighter main group elements (C, Si, Al,                
              etc.) are prepared in supersonic molecular beams using the                     
              technique of pulsed nozzle laser vaporization. Similar methods                 
              are used to synthesize metal containing ion-molecule complexes.                
              These jet cooled species are size-selected in a specially                      
              designed reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer system.                   
              Wavelength dependent visible and/or ultraviolet laser                          
              photodissociation spectroscopy provides a probe of electronic,                 
              vibrational and rotational levels in these systems.  These                     
              novel experiments investigate cluster electronic and geometric                 
              structure, photochemical dissociation channels, and excited                    
              state dynamics, providing significant new tests of fundamental                 
              bonding principles.
