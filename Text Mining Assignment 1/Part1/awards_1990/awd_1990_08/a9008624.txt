Abstract    :
              The direct synthesis of high temperature materials by                          
              combustion can proceed in different fashion depending upon the                 
              phases of the reactants.  When one reactant is a gas and the                   
              other is a compact powder, the process is termed filtration                    
              combustion.  Various analyses of solid-solid combustion and an                 
              initial analysis of the planar counter-flow mode (ie., the                     
              reactant gas velocity and the combustion wave move in opposite                 
              directions) have already been completed.  The current research                 
              will extend this to include the co-flowing and diffusional                     
              modes of filtration combustion.  Additionally, the following                   
              topics will be addressed:  transient modes of propagation                      
              (stable and unstable), nonadiabatic effects, two-step                          
              kinetics, effects of melting of the reactant, densification                    
              during reaction, and application of adaptive pseudospectral                    
              methods to numerically modelling multi-dimensional flame                       
              propagation.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Self-propagating high temperature synthesis is an innovative                   
              method for fabrication of ceramic and metallic materials.  The                 
              theoretical study, to be performed in collaboration with the                   
              Chernogolovka Institute of Structural Macrokinetics as part of                 
              the US-USSR Cooperation in the Field of Basic Scientific                       
              Research Program, will yield insight into the complex                          
              phenomena involved.  The results will aid in explaining past                   
              observed behavior and designing future experiments necessary                   
              to make the process competitive.
