Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to develop a systematic                      
              approach to shaping the response of nonlinear systems                          
              to applied forcing mechanisms with the aim of controlling or at                
              least influencing the system behavior.  A longer term goal,                    
              currently being pursued only at an experimental level, is also to              
              take advantage of exotic nonlinear behavior to achieve a system                
              response which cannot be realized with a linear system.                        
              This proposal focuses on the development of a theory of steady-                
              state response and to an unanticipated solution of the "nonlinear              
              regulator problem", for small deviations from an equilibrium.                  
              One rather promising new frontier involves a structure of the                  
              solution of the regulator problem which seems particularly                     
              amenable to a computational implementation of the resulting                    
              feedback law.  Indeed, the compution requires the off-line                     
              solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation which is                 
              apparently the analogue, for nonlinear systems, of the Riccati                 
              equation of linear control systems.
