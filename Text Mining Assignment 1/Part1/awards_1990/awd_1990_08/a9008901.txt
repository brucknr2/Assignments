Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of the work described in this proposal is to                     
              determine how stress negatively influences learning and memory.                
              It is known that a brain structure called the hippocampus is                   
              necessary for many forms of learning.  In addition, the                        
              hippocampus has a high number of receptors which detect the                    
              presence of stress related hormones in the blood.  What does the               
              presence of such stress hormones do to the normal function of the              
              hippocampus?  This question will be answered using                             
              electrophysiological and behavioral techniques in rats.  In                    
              particular, work will focus on determining the influence of                    
              stress related hormones on primed burst potentiation, a very long              
              lasting increase in the strength of connections in the                         
              hippocampus which is induced by threshold electrical stimulation.              
              Primed burst potentiation may represent a mechanism which is                   
              normally used by the brain to make memories.
