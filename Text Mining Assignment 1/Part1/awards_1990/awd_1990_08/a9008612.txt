Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a multidisciplinary effort involving metallurgy, physics,              
              and chemistry to explore a new approach to the processing of                   
              primary aluminum-lithium, magnesium-lithium, and copper-lithium                
              alloys.  The process employs an impinging lithium vapor on the                 
              metal surface with subsequent movement of the lithium into the                 
              alloy by solid-state diffusion.  The process is unique in that it              
              introduces the reactive element into the alloy in the final                    
              stages of the production of the wrought product.  Risks involved               
              include the ability to reach a homogeneous distribution of the                 
              diffusing lithium in a reasonably short time frame and possible                
              problems associated with unintended oxidation of the alloy during              
              processing.
