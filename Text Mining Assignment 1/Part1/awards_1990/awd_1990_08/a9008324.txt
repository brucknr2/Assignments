Abstract    :
              This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two                
              years.  The project is entitled "Regulation of Beta-tubulin mRNA               
              Expression during Nodule Development on Alfalfa Roots."                        
                                                                                             
              The Research Fellowships in Plant Biology are granted to                       
              applicants trained in traditional areas of plant biology who wish              
              to extend their training in new techniques and to those trained                
              in molecular or cellular techniques who wish to gain experience                
              working with plants.  These fellowships are designed to increase               
              the number of outstanding young scientists in plant biology.
