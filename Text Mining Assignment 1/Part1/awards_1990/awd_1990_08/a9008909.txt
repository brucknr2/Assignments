Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will extend previous work developing a computer                  
              simulation model of human memory.  The project includes two kinds              
              of activities.  First, the research will use simulation to                     
              explore interesting properties of the model in greater depth and               
              to apply the model to human memory phenomena that were not                     
              considered in its initial development.  Second, the research will              
              include experiments on human memory, in order to better                        
              understand the reasons behind several of the model's apparent                  
              predictive failures.  These experiments will focus on how                      
              information is retrieved from memory and how judgments regarding               
              remembered events are based on the retrieved information.  The                 
              questions to which the experiments are addressed are general                   
              ones, not model-specific, so that the experimental results will                
              be of broad relevance to theories of human memory.   Although                  
              this work is unlikely to have immediate practical application, it              
              will further our understanding of the properties of human memory               
              and its role in cognition, and so will contribute in the long run              
              to applications in such areas as education and training, brain                 
              damage and amnesia, and biases in human judgment and decision                  
              making.
