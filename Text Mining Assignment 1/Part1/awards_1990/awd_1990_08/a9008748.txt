Abstract    :
              This ia a ROW Research Planning application to study                           
              streaming currents in bone under stress.  The PI is                            
              proposing preliminary experiments and finite element                           
              analysis.  Understanding streaming currents may be                             
              important for bone remodeling and for possible eventual                        
              uses on engineering interventions to speed bone healing.
