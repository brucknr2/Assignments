Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  In many situations fear is a learned response.  This                      
              research project seeks to understand the neurobiological                       
              mechanisms underlying these learned fears.  One line of research               
              examines manipulations of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors to see                
              if they are involved in encoding of fear memory as opposed to                  
              memory consolidation, retrieval or behavioral performance.  This               
              receptor is interesting because it has been implicated in certain              
              changes in neurons that may provide a way for the nervous system               
              to store information.  The second line of research explores the                
              role of endogenous opioids (endorphins) in fear learning.  Fear                
              causes release of endorphins and these endorphins in turn limit                
              or regulate additional learning.  This regulation normally                     
              results in controlling the magnitude of fear, so that the amount               
              of fear is appropriate for the particular circumstance.
