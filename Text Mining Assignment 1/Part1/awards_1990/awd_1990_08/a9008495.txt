Abstract    :
              Often in real chemical reactors, a large number of distinct                    
              species interact through an intricate network of chemical                      
              reactions.  Such complex systems can behave in unexpected                      
              ways, causing multiple steady states, instabilities, runaway                   
              reactions, explosions, etc.  The goal of this research is the                  
              creation of theory that provides practicing engineers and                      
              chemists with readily applicable analytical tools to be used                   
              for:  (1) the operation of reactors with complex but well                      
              understood chemistry (the theory would provide an indication                   
              of the stability problems that should be a source of concern),                 
              and (2) the study of reactors with poorly understood chemistry                 
              (the theory would provide means for the sensitive                              
              discrimination between rival mechanisms put forward to account                 
              for laboratory observations).  The PI's chemical reaction                      
              theory is rooted in the idea that, however vast the territory                  
              of chemical reaction engineering might seem, the systems of                    
              differential equations that present themselves for study have                  
              a very special structure.  At least when the kinetics is mass                  
              action, each system is determined (up to rate constant values)                 
              in a very precise way from the underlying network of chemical                  
              reactions, and so it becomes meaningful to ask questions about                 
              the relationship between reaction network structure and                        
              qualitative properties of the corresponding differential                       
              equations.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Work under this grant will consist of three new projects: (1)                  
              unification of the PI's earlier deficiency-oriented theories                   
              with newer developments based on his Species-Complex-Linkage                   
              graph (SCL Graph) and application to more complex systems such                 
              as electrochemical reactions; (2) application of existing and                  
              newly developed theory to heterogeneous catalysis with special                 
              emphasis on the way in which the operative catalytic pathway                   
              reveals itself in multiple steady state data by way of a                       
              characteristic "mechanistic signature"; and (3) development of                 
              user-oriented personal computer software which would not                       
              require knowledge of the underlying complex mathematical                       
              analysis.
