Abstract    :
              This is an ambitious proposal to advance the foundation of risk and            
              decision analysis.  The research focuses on decisions where                    
              incomplete or conflicting knowledge creates ambiguity about the                
              probability of an event.  In order to account for ambiguity                    
              aversion, the models to be investigated contain modifications to               
              utilities rather than probabilities.  Also, the proposed research              
              is based on the concept of situation specific utility functions.               
                                                                                             
              The planned investigation will look at three important issues: the             
              impact of probability ambiguity on choice, the incorporation of                
              equity in social risk management, and the extension of generalized             
              utility theory.  The emphasis for each issue is on building and                
              testing models.  The general research strategy will be based on                
              parallel theoretical development and empirical analysis.  This                 
              coordination between theory and data should lead to improved models            
              that can be applied in operational contexts.
