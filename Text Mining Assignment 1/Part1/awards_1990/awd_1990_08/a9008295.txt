Abstract    :
              This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two                
              years.  This project is entitled "The Role of HSP 70 Homologues                
              in Protein Translocation into and Within Higher Plant                          
              Chloroplasts".  The research Fellowships in Plant Biology are                  
              granted to applicants trained in traditional areas of plant                    
              biology who wish to extend their training in new techniques and                
              to those trained in molecular or cellular techniques who wish to               
              gain experience working with plants.  These fellowships are                    
              designed to increase the number of outstanding young scientists                
              in plant biology.
