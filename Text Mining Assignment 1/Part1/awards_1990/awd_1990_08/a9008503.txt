Abstract    :
              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the                
              research of Dr. Harold Hart of the Department of Chemistry at                  
              Michigan State University.  Dr. Hart will continue his program                 
              which focuses on the synthesis of novel aromatic compounds with                
              rigid frameworks that have intramolecular cavities, and that                   
              have exceptional thermal stabilities.                                          
                                                                                             
              Synthetic studies developed for the iptycenes will be extended                 
              to substituted and functionalized supertriptycene, to                          
              supertritriptycene, to cycloiptycenes, to novel iptycene                       
              "trimers", to helically chiral iptycenes, and to triptycenes                   
              containing two and three anthracene moieties.  Also targeted                   
              for synthesis is tetrahedralene, a novel C36H24 hydrocarbon                    
              containing four tri-substituted benzene rings and six cis                      
              double bonds that has T symmetry, a central cavity, and is                     
              calculated to be strain-free.
