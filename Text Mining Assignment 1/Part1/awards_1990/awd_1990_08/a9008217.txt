Abstract    :
              This project examines the development since World War II of                    
              federal policies to regulate the relationship between home and                 
              work.  Such policies specify how work organizations are to treat               
              individuals defined in terms of their family status.  The project              
              focuses on three aspects of policy development:  the movement of               
              issues on and off the congressional agenda, the development of                 
              alternative proposals, and the enactment of legislation.  Factors              
              affecting policy development will include the concerns of                      
              experts, media coverage, activities of interest groups and social              
              movements, and public opinion.  The PI will analyze the contents               
              of policy proposals, gathered from government documents, reports               
              in newspapers, specialized journals, and public opinion polls.                 
              The results will be an analysis of a major policy area, which                  
              will aid the study of other issue areas.
