Abstract    :
              Extension tables are a memo structure for logic programs that save the         
              extension of a predicate in a table.  Subsequent calls, whose answers          
              are in the table, use a table lookup rather than recomputing the               
              results.  Since the terms that are saved are not necessarily ground            
              facts, the induced subsumption ordering on Prolog terms is used to             
              avoid saving redundant information in the table.  This duplicate               
              elimination mechanism will be extended by allowing for the                     
              specification of orderings other than those given by the subsumption           
              of Prolog terms.  This enhanced capability modifies the behavior of            
              the execution method to provide an approximate evaluation of the logic         
              program based on these orderings.
