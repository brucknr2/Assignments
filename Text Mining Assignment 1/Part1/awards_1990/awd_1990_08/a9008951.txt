Abstract    :
              Affect control theory is a mathematical model that describes how               
              social roles, behaviors, and emotions are related to one another.              
              This project uses five studies to test predictions from the                    
              theory.  The first study tests the theory in natural settings by               
              sampling people's emotions at random times throughout their                    
              normal waking activities.  It will be one of the first studies to              
              get a representative sample of the emotions that people actually               
              experience.  The theory argues that people's emotions should                   
              change in specific ways when they change from one role to                      
              another.  The second study will use subjects' reactions to                     
              descriptions of unusual events (presented to them under                        
              controlled laboratory conditions) to test ideas about how these                
              atypical situations may influence emotional responses.  The third              
              and fourth studies test predictions about how other peoples'                   
              emotional reactions influence what we think about them.  The                   
              fifth study pursues some practical implications of this idea for               
              the criminal justice system.  If the theory is true, the                       
              sentences handed down to convicted criminals are influenced in                 
              counterintuitive ways by their emotional displays.
