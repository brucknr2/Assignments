Abstract    :
              In December 1988, the Marine Systems Engineering                               
              Laboratory (MSEL) began a program, funded by the National                      
              Science Foundation (Grant No. EID-8818406), to investigate                     
              the key issues in the design of knowledge-based systems                        
              for use in Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) systems.                        
              It was directed at understanding some of the problems                          
              associated with utilizing these knowledge-based systems in                     
              real time domains.  The efforts focused on establishing a                      
              symbolic processing environment which would exist on top                       
              of a real time operating system.                                               
                                                                                             
              This effort which builds on the results of the initial                         
              work, reflects the insights which were developed during                        
              the initial phase of this program.  The investigations                         
              will be accomplished over a two year period and will                           
              result in the implementation of a intelligent real-time                        
              scheduler for expert systems running in Autonomous                             
              Undersea Vehicle (AUV) systems.  It defines an effort to                       
              develop a scheduling algorithm in accordance with the                          
              criteria specified as a result of our previous work in                         
              designing real-time expert systems.  The product of this                       
              effort will be a domain-independent scheduling algorithm                       
              suitable for use in any environment where multiple                             
              knowledge sources interact in a time-constrained fashion.
