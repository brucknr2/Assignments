Abstract    :
                 This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Chlan to                    
              initiate studies of temporal and tissue specific regulation of                 
              gene expression in plants.  She will focus on cottonseed storage               
              proteins as a model system.                                                    
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that this award will help Dr. Chlan obtain                   
              preliminary results necessary to launch an independent research                
              career.
