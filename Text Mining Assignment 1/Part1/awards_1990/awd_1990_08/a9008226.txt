Abstract    :
              This project focuses on design of efficient algorithms for                     
              combinatorial optimization problems.  Many efficient parallel                  
              algorithms were obtained as a result of a deeper understanding of              
              combinatorial structure of the problems, and therefore the emphasis of         
              this research is to combine the work on improving the                          
              parallel/distributed complexity of the algorithms with the work on             
              improving their sequential complexity.  In particular, the research            
              concentrates on finding efficient parallel deterministic algorithms            
              for the class of problems related to bipartite matching and on finding         
              efficient sequential  algorithms for problems related to generalized           
              flow and multicommodity flow.  Another important part of this research         
              is to develop techniques that allow transformation of efficient                
              parallel algorithms into algorithms that are efficient in the context          
              of distributed computation.
