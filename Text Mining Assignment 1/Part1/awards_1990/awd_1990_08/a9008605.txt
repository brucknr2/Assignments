Abstract    :
              The overall goal of this proposal is to extend present                         
              steady, laminar flow experiments by characterizing the                         
              response of anchorage-dependent cells to shear stresses                        
              varying at the frequencies encountered in a bioreactor                         
              environment.  Idealized single frequency cyclic stresses                       
              will be tested as a way of understanding the different                         
              responses caused by the spectrum of turbulent shear                            
              stresses.  These will be compared to the responses to                          
              actual turbulent stresses to validate the fluid mechanical                     
              simplification.  The categories of experiments to be done                      
              are:                                                                           
                                                                                             
               - Comparison of cell response to laminar versus                               
                 turbulent flows in a flow chamber.                                          
               - Comparison with cells grown in a turbulent stirred                          
                 bioreactor.                                                                 
               - Effects of low frequency (< 1 Hz) flow changes in the                       
                 flow chamber.                                                               
               - Effect of high frequency (> 1 Hz) uniaxial shear                            
                 stresses in a zero-mean-flow system.                                        
               - Effect of rotating shear stress vectors of various                          
                 constant magnitudes.
