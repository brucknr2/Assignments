Abstract    :
                   One of the outstanding problem areas in global tropospheric               
              chemistry is the sulfur chemistry of the marine atmosphere.  The               
              University of Washington (UW) has embarked on a research program               
              to address two important aspects of this problem:  determination               
              of the vertical distributions of sulfur species in marine air and              
              the factors responsible for these distributions, and                           
              determination of the relationships between dimethylsulfide,                    
              sulfate, cloud condensation nuclei and cloud microstructures in                
              marine air.                                                                    
                   In the past two years, the UW has developed, calibrated and               
              field tested the instruments needed for field measurements.  It                
              has developed sampling protocols and analysis techniques,                      
              obtained preliminary field measurements, and begun numerical                   
              modeling studies.  Topics to be studied include: relationship                  
              between dimethyl sulfide in seawater and the air, diurnal,                     
              seasonal and geographic variability of dimethyl sulfide                        
              concentrations, dimethyl sulfide oxidation, sulfur dioxide                     
              production, sulfur dioxide oxidation, MSA-sulfur dioxide                       
              branching, cloud pumping, sulfur dioxide to sulfate conversion in              
              clouds and the dimethyl sulfide-climate hypotheses.                            
                   The field studies will be carried out as part of the Pacific              
              Sulfur/Stratus Investigation in the NE.  In addition, seasonal                 
              variability will be explored through flights over the NE Pacific.
