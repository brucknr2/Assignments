Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant is for the renewal of a highly productive research                  
              program at Marquette University (DMR-8701160), which resulted in               
              several scientific papers and graduate students in the area of                 
              thermodynamic properties of compound semiconductor materials.  In              
              addition, undergraduate students were involved with the research               
              thereby attracting promising students to graduate careers in                   
              science and engineering research and teaching.  The research                   
              during this grant period emphasizes experimental determination of              
              chemical bond energies of the substitutional acceptors, zinc and               
              cadmium, in germanium, silicon, and mercury-telluride.  The                    
              partial pressure of zinc and cadmium over solid solutions in                   
              silicon or germanium-containing acceptor dopants is being                      
              determined from the optical absorbance of the vapor phase using                
              hollow cathode lamps.  The chemical potential and partial molar                
              enthalpy and entropy are determined from the data.  Likewise the               
              same thermodynamic parameters are being determined for mercury                 
              and cadmium zinc telluride.  In addition to the research, the                  
              program has a significant impact on the infrastructure by                      
              training students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels                
              in this critical science.
