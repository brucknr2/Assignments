Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Mobile animals often move through complex environments on regular              
              migratory routes between their shelters, feeding places, and                   
              breeding sites.  The mechanisms underlying such migrations are                 
              poorly understood.  Coral-reef fishes that migrate daily between               
              different places in one local area offer an outstanding                        
              opportunity to study these mechanisms.                                         
                                                                                             
              The doctoral-dissertation research of Anthony I. Mazeroll will                 
              investigate the mechanisms underlying the local daily migrations               
              of brown surgeonfish during the summer spawning season in the                  
              northern Red Sea (Gulf of Aqaba, Israel).  Mr. Mazeroll will                   
              conduct experiments designed to reveal the roles of learning,                  
              memory, and cognitive maps in these migratory movements.                       
                                                                                             
              This research will provide valuable information about the various              
              factors influencing local migrations of animals.  It will also                 
              reveal details about the abilities of animals to learn and                     
              remember physical features of their environments, and will                     
              thereby contribute to a small but important body of knowledge                  
              about the role of learning in natural populations.
