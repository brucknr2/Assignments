Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Thioredoxin is a redox protein implicated in reducing functions in             
              a wide variety of cell types, and is recognized as playing                     
              significant roles in metabolism and survival.  The functions of                
              this enzyme(s) in cyanobacteria is here focused on the                         
              physiological functions of two distinct forms of the enzyme present            
              in the cyanobacteria and in chloroplasts of green plants.  The                 
              effects of nitrogen and sulfur starvation on the amounts of these              
              enzymes present in cells will be assessed, as will also the                    
              function in deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis.  Molecular genetic               
              aspects of the two thioredoxins will be studied in relationship to             
              function in photoautotrophic growth.                                           
                                                                                             
              Seeking a more thorough understanding of the functions of two forms            
              of the enzymes known as thioredoxins is the object of this                     
              research.  These enzymes are present in green plant chloroplasts               
              and in the cyanobacteria, the latter the focus of this project; the            
              functions effected by each form is unclear and should be clarified             
              by the approaches to be employed.  The role of these enzymes in                
              regulation of cell activities in a wide variety of organisms is                
              being recognized as of increasing significance.
