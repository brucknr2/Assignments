Abstract    :
              Random access machines typically have fixed, bounded word size.  This          
              research concerns the computational complexity of solving data                 
              structure and algorithm problems on such machines, assuming that the           
              input descriptions for computational problems involve quantities that          
              individually fit into single machine words.  Specific topics include           
              the inherent complexity of data structure problems in the cell probe           
              model of computation, the complexity of memory mapping encodings, and          
              the construction and applications of new data structures that perform          
              searching with sublogarithmic complexity.
