Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will conduct planning activities               
              during the period of this grant.  She will attend a summer                     
              program at the Institute of Mathematics and Its Applications on                
              New Directions in Time Series.  This will allow her to make                    
              several contacts in the community and be aware of the current                  
              directions of research.  She will also conduct research on                     
              bootstrap for time series.  The bootstrap is a procedure which                 
              allows for resampling of the collected data in order to obtain                 
              information about the variability of the sample.  She will                     
              investigate this procedure in the time series setting.  In                     
              particular she will use the bootstrap to learn more about the                  
              behavior of the estimates of order determination of models.
