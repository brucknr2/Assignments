Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research from the Inorganic,                  
              Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program will enable                  
              the purchase of a scanning tunnelling microscope for use by Dr.                
              M. Keith DeArmond and Dr. Robert V. Hoffman. The microscope                    
              will be used to study metal complexes suspended in thin                        
              (Langmuir-Blodgett) films. The aim of the project is to use                    
              light or electrochemical excitation to produce charge-separated                
              states of the suspended metal complexes which would function as                
              molecular switches. The metal complexes will be solubilized in                 
              the organic films by pairing the cationic complexes with anions                
              of organic acids. The microscope will be used both to obtain                   
              information about the lateral ordering of the films and to                     
              follow the ligand-to-ligand electron motion caused by infrared                 
              irradiation.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Although high-risk in nature, the project could result in a                    
              significant step toward the design of molecular-level                          
              electronics.
