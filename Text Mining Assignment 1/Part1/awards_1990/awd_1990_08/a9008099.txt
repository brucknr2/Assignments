Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support to continue a symposium                    
              series on "Current Topics in Plant Biochemistry and Physiology".               
              These symposia are sponsored by the Interdisciplinary Plant                    
              Biochemistry and Physiology Group of the University of Missouri-               
              Columbia.  The purpose of the "Current Topics in Plant                         
              Biochemistry and Physiology Symposium" is to promote awareness of              
              advances in research in interrelated areas of plant biology by                 
              providing a forum for the exhange of scientific information and                
              by catalyzing the generation of new ideas and interactions.                    
              Topics focus on 3 or 4 areas ranging from molecular to whole-                  
              plant studies.  The Symposium environment enhances the crucial                 
              personal interaction among students, postdoctorates and                        
              researchers from a broad range of research disciplines.  The                   
              Proceedings of the Symposia have been and will continue to be                  
              published.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This symposium series provides a lively forum for students to                  
              become involved in the development of science.  The choice of                  
              multiple topics rather than a single topic enchances the                       
              interdisciplinary nature of the Symposium, facilitates                         
              information transfer to a wider audience and promotes personal                 
              interaction between students and researchers of more than one                  
              research area.  The meeting is held annually in the spring at the              
              University of Missouri-Columbia.
