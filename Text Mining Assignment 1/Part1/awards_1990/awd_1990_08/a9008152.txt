Abstract    :
                   This research examines the problem of detecting and                       
              estimating a change in a statistical regression model that is                  
              composed of two different linear phases. The nonstandard behavior              
              of the likelihood ratio statistic will be exhibited and analytic               
              approximations to the sampling distribution of various test                    
              statistics will be given for the multiple linear regression                    
              model. Power functions and confidence regions will be derived.                 
              The methods developed to solve boundary crossing problems in                   
              sequential analysis will be applied to these problems.
