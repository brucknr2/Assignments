Abstract    :
                   Studies in theoretical physics will focus on                              
              investigations of geometric phases in quantum mechanics which                  
              are generalizations of those originally discovered by Berry,                   
              and on quantum mechanical phase shifts which can occur in the                  
              presence of electromagnetic or gravitational potentials.  These                
              investigations concern the fundamental character of quantum                    
              mechanics, and will help to illuminate the subtle nature of                    
              this theoretical framework in terms of which essentially all                   
              submicroscopic physical phenomena are understood.
