Abstract    :
                   The large peat basins of North America represent an                       
              important reservoir in the global carbon cycle and a significant               
              source of atmospheric methane.  Two target areas have been                     
              selected in these peat basins where peat nearly covers the                     
              regional landscape: 1) the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatlands of                   
              Minnesota and 2) the Albany River peatlands in northern Ontario.               
              These two areas represent important reference points along major               
              ecologic and climatic gradients.                                               
                   Dr. Glaser and Siegel will utilize a nested grid of sample                
              points in these systems to determine 1) rates of carbon storage                
              or loss, 2) rates and mechanisms of methane flux, and 3)                       
              hydrogeologic processes that control the flux of dissolved gases               
              and solutes through these peat deposits.  They will test four                  
              models of peatland development to determine if these peat basins               
              are sources, sinks, or steady-state reservoirs for carbon.  And                
              regional estimates of the flux of methane and other dissolved                  
              solutes in the two study areas will be made with spatial                       
              statistics and hydrogeologic computer models.                                  
                   This project is focused on an important reservoir of carbon               
              that may be intimately linked with climatic change. The research               
              program is being conducted by two highly regarded scientists who               
              have access to excellent facilities.  Results from this important              
              research will improve understanding of the processes that                      
              contribute to changes in the global environment.
