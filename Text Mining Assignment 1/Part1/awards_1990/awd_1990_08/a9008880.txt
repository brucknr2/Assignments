Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Gantt's                   
              visit to Dr. Tandeau de Marsac's laboratory at the Pasteur                     
              Institute.  Dr. Gantt will initiate a collaboration with Dr.                   
              Tandeau de Marsac, in which molecular recombinant DNA techniques               
              will be applied to the study of phycobilisomes in the                          
              photosynthetic apparatus of red algae and cyanobacteria.  This                 
              collaboration will bring together Dr. Gantt's long-term                        
              experience and expertise with phycobilisomes (which she                        
              discovered) with the molecular recombinant DNA techniques which                
              are available to be learned and used in Dr. Tandeau de Marsac's                
              laboratory.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Given the depth of experience that Dr. Gantt already has in her                
              field, the acquisition of these new techniques and development of              
              this new collaboration are anticipated to lead to substantial new              
              breakthroughs and thereby enhance Dr. Gantt's career.
