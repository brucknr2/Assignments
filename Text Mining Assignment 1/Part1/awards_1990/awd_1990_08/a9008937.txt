Abstract    :
              This award supplies funding to provide an existing near-infrared               
              camera with state-of-the art focal plane array detectors.  The                 
              instrument was built to ensure that astronomers at the                         
              Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington (OCIW)                 
              have the best possible near-infrared array camera for general use              
              between 1 and 2.5 um.  OCIW is a partner is a consortium that has              
              a contract with the Rockwell Science Center to produce a series                
              of HgCdTe array detectors.  The funding will be used mostly for                
              hardware items -- the detectors, some electronics, and a                       
              computer.  OCIW will cover all the salary money needed to                      
              complete this project.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The major scientific programs to be carried out with the camera                
              in the next several years concern primarily a long-term study of               
              stellar populations in distant galaxies in clusters, direct                    
              imaging of the environs of Young Stellar Objects, morphologies of              
              high redshift (z > 2) radio galaxies, and infrared photometry of               
              Cepheids.
