Abstract    :
              This project investigates techniques that allow programs written               
              in the Production System (PS) paradigm to reason correctly and                 
              efficiently with large databases located on secondary storage. A               
              class of stratified PS programs are identified. For this class                 
              of programs, an operational semantics and a model theoretic                    
              semantics are developed. The correct semantics ensure that a                   
              stratified PS program will correspond to a consistent theory,                  
              the execution of the program will not produce incorrect,                       
              inconsistent answers and execution of the program will                         
              terminate. Implementation techniques for stratified PS programs                
              using relational data structures and relational queries are                    
              developed as well as strategies for the concurrent execution of                
              productions in stratified PS programs. The results of this                     
              research will provide a foundation for expert systems, written as              
              stratified PS programs, to reason correctly and efficiently with               
              data in relational databases.
