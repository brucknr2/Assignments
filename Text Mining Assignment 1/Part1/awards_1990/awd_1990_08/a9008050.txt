Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to quantify the dynamic reliability           
              performance of an electric power system by designing a methodology,            
              developing a power system dynamic simulation program with capability           
              in static adequacy evaluation and by applying the technique to test            
              systems.  The methodologies are expected to be microcomputer based.            
              The work includes formulation of indices which will help to                    
              characterize the severity of disturbances in power system performance.         
              Also the indices might be used to compare system adequacy.  The                
              project is expected to lead to the integration of system security and          
              system adequacy evaluation.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The project is a Research Initiation Award (RIA).
