Abstract    :
              A multiple target apparatus will be                                            
              built for epitaxial growth of                                                  
              semiconductors, magnetic

              Specific elements of our                                                       
              investigation are: (1) Evaluate the                                            
              growth of new semiconductor

              atomic monolayers. This could                                                  
              become a totally new type of

              important materials such as InGaAs2                                            
              and GaA13As4 would not have alloy-                                             
              related problems like carrier                                                  
              scattering and energy level

              of the magnetic susceptibility are                                             
              expected for Cd3MnTe4, which appear                                            
              to be necessary for devices like                                               
              magnetically-tunable lasers and                                                
              Faraday rotators. (3) Evaluate the

              p-n junctions are just beginning to                                            
              become feasible for CdTe and                                                   
              possible ZnSe.  (4) Overlaying thin

              to higher density magnetic

              of insulating barriers could lead                                              
              to improve tunnel junctions.
