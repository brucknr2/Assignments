Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds for a joint research project between            
              two I/UCRC's.  The Center for Non-destructive evaluation at Iowa               
              State University and the Ohio State University Research Foundation.            
                   The proposed study will address both theoretical and                      
              experimental aspects of detecting flaws through rough surface and              
              interfaces in thin inhomogeneous layers using ultrasonic                       
              techniques.  The proposed research will provide a significant                  
              extension of knowledge of the impact of surface quality on the                 
              probability of detection of interior defects.  The area of                     
              ultrasonic NDE is critical to the establishment of the performance             
              of structural elements in buildings, airplanes, submarines, bridges            
              etc.  The IAB of each center has approved this research and their              
              matching funds.                                                                
                   The Program Director recommends a grant of $50,000 for two                
              years be awarded to Ohio State University.
