Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An International Conference on the Nerve Growth Cone is planned                
              for the Santiago Ramon y Cajal Neurobiology Institute in Madrid,               
              SPAIN from October 15-19, 1990.  The goal of the Conference is to              
              bring together top researchers on nerve growth cones to                        
              synthesize current knowledge, develop new concepts of growth cone              
              function, and crystalize strategies for future experimentation.                
              This meeting is especially timely, because techniques and tools                
              now coming available from chemistry, molecular biology,                        
              physiology, optics and computerized imaging technology are                     
              allowing significant gains in elucidation of how growth cones                  
              mediate the intricate construction of nervous systems.  A meeting              
              of scientists who use these diverse methods will generate new                  
              insights and collaborations.  The conference will cover the                    
              following topics:  internal chemistry and physiology of growth                 
              cone activity, external control of growth cone behavior, growth                
              cone activity in developing organisms as neural circuits are                   
              constructed, and growth cone activity in adult organisms and                   
              after neural circuits are damaged.  Thus, this meeting will help               
              explain how the brain grows, adapts, learns, and perhaps can be                
              repaired.  Twenty nine speakers have already agreed to speak at                
              the meeting and also write a chapter for a published monograph.                
              In addition, poster exhibits will be presented.  Neurobiological               
              interest in growth cone activity has grown tremendously, and this              
              first meeting devoted solely to growth cones will receive wide                 
              notice and will enhance research in the area for several years.
