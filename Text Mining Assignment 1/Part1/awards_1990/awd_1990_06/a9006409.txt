Abstract    :
                   The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction witnessed the                          
              disappearance of many organismal groups, but the planktonic                    
              Foraminifera (a floating one-celled animal group) survived as a                
              single lineage of dwarfed species.  These surviving species                    
              diversified in the world's oceans and are common microfossils in               
              marine sediments.  Drs. Gerta Keller and Norman MacLeod propose a              
              study of the surviving lineages preserved immediately following                
              the extinction.  Quantitative study of their morphology will                   
              allow reconstruction of ancestor-descendant relationships.                     
              Analysis of species diversity patterns, as well as carbon and                  
              oxygen isotope ratios preserved in shell material, will provide                
              new insight into the environmental changes that may have                       
              coincided with or caused the extinction and subsequent                         
              evolutionary radiation.                                                        
                   The proposed study will find a wide audience among all                    
              paleontologists interested in extinctions, among paleoecologists               
              and paleoceanographers, and among evolutionary biologists in                   
              general.
