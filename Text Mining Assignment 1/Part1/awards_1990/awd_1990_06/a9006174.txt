Abstract    :
              The importance of the reversible phosphorylation of proteins, as               
              a mechanism for the control of cell function, is well documented.              
              A strategy has been initiated whereby cloned genes for the                     
              catalytic subunits of several protein phosphatases are expressed               
              in cells under the control of a regulatable promoter.  Mutant                  
              phosphatases with truncated carboxyl and/or amino termini are                  
              also being constructed and tested for expression and activity in               
              several cell types.  By using this genetic approach, it is                     
              proposed that specific phosphorylation events can be markedly                  
              blunted or rapidly reversed thus altering the normal protein                   
              kinase activated pathways in the cell.  The role of protein                    
              phosphorylation cascades and their regulation by specific                      
              phosphatases can be studied in relationship to cell metabolism,                
              growth, and differentiation.  An additional goal of this project               
              is to characterize the repertoire of protein phosphatases in                   
              selected cell types using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and DNA              
              sequencing.  This will allow us to estimate the number and nature              
              of protein phosphatases within a specific cell type, as well as                
              potentially identifying new phosphatase genes.
