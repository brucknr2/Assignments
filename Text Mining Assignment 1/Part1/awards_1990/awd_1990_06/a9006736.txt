Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to develop a new facility for high                
              precision optical measurements in the submillimeter-to-very-far-               
              infrared (150 - 350 GHz) spectral range.  This facility will be                
              based on a network analyzer and various cavity and Fabry-Perot                 
              resonators and will bridge the gap between the conventional                    
              waveguide configuration and optical measurements.  The resonant                
              configurations will enable precise measurements of the reflectivity            
              with a sensitivity of the order of the quality factor of the                   
              resonators, namely of order of 104 times single pass optical                   
              experiments.  This facility will be used in conjunction with                   
              optical experiments to explore the electrodynamics of several                  
              highly correlated metallic systems such as heavy fermion                       
              superconductors, charge and spin density wave systems and unusual              
              superconductors.
