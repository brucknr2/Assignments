Abstract    :
              Low-Temperature experiments will probe the manifestation of                    
              quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale:  tunneling of the                    
              magnetization of ferrite particles down to 1mK; NMR studies on a               
              heavy-fermion superconductor to look for the existence of                      
              multiple sc phases; examination by acoustic techniques of the                  
              fundamental properties of superfluid 3He and its modified                      
              behavior in a thin-film configuration.
