Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PI seeks support for an investigation of a novel                      
              technique to quantify the changes in intracellular concentrations              
              of calcium that are associated with the activity of hippocampal                
              neurons involved in learning and memory.  Specifically, calcium-               
              sensitive fluorescent dyes will be mircroinjected into selected                
              neurons and monitored using a dual-wavelength spectrofluorimeter               
              and scanning confocal microscope following manipulation of                     
              neuronal activity, such as high-frequency tetanus to produce long              
              term potentiation.  The proposed research is a gamble and there                
              is a minimum of preliminary data to allow an easy judgement.                   
              However, the investigators have made excellent progress in                     
              analyzing calcium changes in cultured cells.  The difficulty is                
              in extending these procedures to the tissue slice.  The potential              
              for a significant outcome seems sufficient to justify the risk.                
              The ability to make high-resolution measurements of calcium                    
              changes in hippocampal neurons will have an impact on many areas               
              of neuroscience, including computational psychology, neural net                
              modeling, and electrophysiology.  This work has the potential to               
              move neuroscience significantly closer to an understanding of the              
              synaptic molecular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory.
