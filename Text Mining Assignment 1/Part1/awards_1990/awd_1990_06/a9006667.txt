Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal addresses the optimization of the movement of                    
              spatial closed chain robotic systems formed by two or more                     
              robots holding the same object.  The proposed research is                      
              to generalize an already developed planar motion                               
              optimization algorithm to spatial closed chains, and form                      
              an interactive system for motion optimization and design of                    
              closed chain robotic systems.  The work proposes to develop                    
              three items including (1) the local path optimizer for                         
              optimizing the motion of the closed chain along a given                        
              path using a linear programming algorithm for time optimal                     
              control, (2) the feasible path generator which generates                       
              the initial path between the start and goal configurations,                    
              and (3) the motion optimization routine which varies the                       
              path to find the optimum.  These items will be packaged to                     
              enable the user to vary the start and goal positions to                        
              study optima, and to vary the dynamic parameters of the                        
              robots and workpiece as well.  This work is of potential                       
              engineering importance in optimal planing for multiple                         
              robot systems.  Initially, the resulting algorithms will be                    
              computationally intensive, but ultimately, they will be                        
              streamlined to make them compatible with future robot                          
              design.
