Abstract    :
                   The goal of this work is to contribute to the understanding               
              of the genetics and evolution of natural populations.  The                     
              mathematical knowledge of the amount and pattern of genetic                    
              diversity under various  conditions is essential for the choice                
              and design of experiments and for the investigation by computer                
              of very complex systems.  Comparison of relatively simple models               
              with observations yields information about particular                          
              populations, and many such comparisons indicate the relative                   
              importance and conditions of action of the basic evolutionary                  
              forces.  The latter include natural selection, mutation,                       
              migration, and random fluctuations in the proportions of various               
              genes.  All of these will be studied in this project.  The                     
              evolution of repeated DNA sequences under gene conversion (the                 
              nonreciprocal transfer of information between genes) will also be              
              investigated.                                                                  
                   In the long run, studies of genetic variability of the type               
              proposed here provide information that helps to preserve and                   
              manage wild animals and plants.  They also advance areas of the                
              genetics of human populations that concern the frequency of                    
              genetic diseases, which are of immense medical importance.
