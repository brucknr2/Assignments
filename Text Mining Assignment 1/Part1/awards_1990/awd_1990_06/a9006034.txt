Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the procurement of equipment needed to                   
              enhance research on mechanics and motion control problems of                   
              computerized electromechanical systems.  This instrumentation                  
              is an integral part of an experimental and theoretical                         
              research effort to study optimal control strategies to                         
              eliminate residual vibrations during point to point position                   
              control of motor driven flexible structures.  The                              
              instrumentation comprises a control analyzer, a digitizing                     
              oscilloscope, a waveform synthesizer, a power amplifier, a                     
              mini shaker, a DC supply/amplifier, a microcomputer, a data                    
              acquisition adaptor, and a plug in board.  The impact of the                   
              research is expected to be on the control of micro actuators                   
              in computer peripherals, robotic manipulators, space                           
              structures, and the active vibration damping of flexible                       
              structures.
