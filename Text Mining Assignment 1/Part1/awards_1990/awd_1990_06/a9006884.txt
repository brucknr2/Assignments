Abstract    :
                  The objective of the research is to evaluate the impact of                 
              shared database and automated planning tools on cost and                       
              performance of design organizations under different management                 
              models.  This study will produce the following specific outcomes:              
              (1) A family of models which predict design process cost dependence            
              on product mix and incorporate cost factors reflecting shared                  
              design and automated planning methods.  (2) A case study of design             
              organization and cost at a major electronics manufacturer which                
              validates these models under conditions of known management                    
              structure and known design methods for a real product family.  (3)             
              Refined scenarios for integration of shared database and automated             
              planning tools under two alternative management models:  separate              
              design and manufacturing functional groups, and joint design and               
              manufacturing working groups. (4) An analytical evaluation of the              
              scenarios and a critical review by industrial participants.  (5)               
              Consolidation and dissemination of results through reports,                    
              seminars, and conference presentations. (6) A Workshop on                      
              Management of Design.
