Abstract    :
                   Gastrotrichs are a poorly known group of aschelminths ("sac               
              worms") that inhabit the world's oceans.  Their minute size                    
              (roughly a millimeter long) has hampered their study, but Dr.                  
              William Hummon proposes an ambitious survey of gastrotrichs from               
              the Mediterranean and Red Seas.  This collaborative effort will                
              bring together many European specialists and will result in a                  
              computer database of species names, a synthesis of distribution                
              data for Europe, and new protocols for sampling, preserving, and               
              studying gastrotrichs.  Dr. Hummon will be testing the use of                  
              video recording and computer digitizing specimens before they are              
              preserved and their original morphology is distorted.                          
                   The proposed research will represent a significant advance                
              in gastrotrich taxonomy, and in our understanding of the minute                
              life forms that exist between sand grains.  More complete                      
              documentation of the diversity of marine life will have direct                 
              impact on biogeographers, marine ecologists, and ecosystem                     
              scientists interested in the coastal zone.
