Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the dynamics of matrix                    
              differential equations and their applications.  These matrix                   
              differential equations are cast in fairly general frameworks of                
              which special cases have been found to be closely related to                   
              important numerical algorithms.  In particular, the dynamics of                
              each matrix differential equation will be explored using computer              
              experiments, high resolution graphics and symbolic manipulation,               
              in conjunction with analysis.  This study is expected to find                  
              important applications ranging from new developments of numerical              
              algorithms to theoretic solutions of open problems.
