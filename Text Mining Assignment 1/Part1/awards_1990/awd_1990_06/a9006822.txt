Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the procurement of equipment needed                      
              to enhance research on high speed motion analysis.  The                        
              equipment comprises a Kodak Spin Physics Motion Analysis                       
              System, a high speed  (1000 frames per second) video tape                      
              camera system.  It will be used for several research                           
              projects including studies of mechanisms, vibratory                            
              particle motion and robotics.  The mechanisms research will                    
              use the camera to study deformation induced by dynamic                         
              action in high speed mechanisms, specifically shaft                            
              couplings which cannot be easily instrumented with strain                      
              gages to measure deformations.  The vibratory particle                         
              research will use the equipment to observe the vibratory                       
              segregation process and measure the individual particle                        
              kinematics in the flow of granular materials.  The robotics                    
              research will use the camera to study insertion tasks in                       
              robotic assembly.
