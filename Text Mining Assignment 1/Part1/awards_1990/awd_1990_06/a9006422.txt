Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will work in the area of time                 
              series analysis and stochastic modeling.  The work is divided                  
              into two parts.  The first part is concerned with problems of                  
              estimation and prediction for time series models whose theory is               
              not yet fully understood.  These include non-linear, heavy                     
              tailed and non-Gaussian processes, all of which play a role in                 
              the modelling of real time series data.  Efficient estimation                  
              and prediction procedures for such series will be sought and                   
              their properties will be investigated.  Some relatively                        
              unexplored models will be considered and some new techniques for               
              state-space modelling of multivariate time series will be                      
              investigated.  The second part deals with extreme value theory,                
              particularly the interplay between extreme value methods, point                
              processes, asymptotic theory and the application of these ideas                
              to linear, bilinear and general stationary processes.
