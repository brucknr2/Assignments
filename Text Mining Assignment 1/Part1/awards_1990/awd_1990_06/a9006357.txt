Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program provides support                  
              for the continuing research of Dr. David M. Grant at the                       
              University of Utah.  This work will afford new insights into                   
              the structures of highly unstable molecular species that will                  
              be studied at very low temperatures.                                           
                                                                                             
              Dr. Grant will utilize infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance                 
              spectroscopy in combination with quantum mechanical                            
              calculations to measure previously inaccessible structural                     
              features of highly strained molecules and reactive                             
              intermediates.  The investigation will focus on species that                   
              can only be isolated at cryogenic temperatures in an inert gas                 
              matrix.  Appropriate doubly labeled precursors will be                         
              synthesized using both carbon and nitrogen isotopes in order to                
              maximize the structural information obtained from the                          
              spectroscopic studies.
