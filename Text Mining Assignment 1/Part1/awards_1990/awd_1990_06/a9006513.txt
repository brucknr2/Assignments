Abstract    :
              Several electronic and physical properties:  electrical                        
              resistivity, thermoelectric power, and physical structure, of a set            
              of carefully chosen solid and liquid metals and semimetals will be             
              measured.  This study includes:  1) the measurement of the                     
              thermopower of liquid gadolinium; 2) measurements of the                       
              resistivity and thermopower of liquid magnesium-calcium, magnesium-            
              strontium, and magnesium-barium; 3) measurement of the total                   
              structure factor for liquid magnesium-barium near the equiatomic               
              composition utilizing neutron diffraction techniques; and 4)                   
              measurements of the thermopower and resistivity of the liquid                  
              alloys aluminum-calcium and aluminum-barium.  These studies will               
              test recent theoretical work, in addition to providing a spur for              
              new developments in the theory and applications of liquid and                  
              amorphous solid systems.
