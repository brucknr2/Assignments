Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this investigation is to explore the mechanisms whereby         
              parasites achieve successful development in their host.  The question          
              is often asked:  "Who is in control of this relationship - the                 
              parasites or their host?"  In Dr. Beckage experiments, larvae of the           
              tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, are used as a model of parasitic              
              infection in conjunction with the wasp parasitoid Cotesia congregata.          
              The wasp injects a virus into host larvae along with its eggs, and the         
              role of the virus in facilitating successful parasitism will be                
              examined.  The virus induces a new protein to be synthesized by the            
              host, and the role of the protein in suppressing the immune response           
              of the host will be tested using hemocyte assays in the presence and           
              the absence of the protein to assess whether it inhibits encapsulation         
              of foreign organisms by the host's blood cells.  Another goal will be          
              to identify the gene encoding the amino acid sequence of the protein           
              and study its regulation in newly parasitized larvae.  A variety of            
              parasites have viruses associated with them, including protozoa and            
              amoebae, yet their role has yet to be identified in most cases.  The           
              viruses may be developed as mechanisms of genetic transformation of            
              arthropods and parasites, thus paving the way of novel genetic studies         
              and manipulation of pest species and medically important parasites.
