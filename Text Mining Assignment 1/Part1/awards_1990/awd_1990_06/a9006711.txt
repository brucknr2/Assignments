Abstract    :
                   Over the past decade and a half, Tilman has developed a                   
              theory of competition based on the premise that the species                    
              withthe lowest equilibrium resource concentration (R*) will be                 
              the superior competitor.   Considerable controversy exists on the              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              validity of the R* concept.  Current experimental evidence is                  
              somewhat contradictory as to the validity of the R* concept, and               
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              in particular, how generally it applies.  This research will                   
              evaluate the basic mechanism of competition and the applicability              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              of the R* concept.  Preliminary studies will determine the                     
              relationships between competitive success and various resource

                   The project will also include the completion of on-going                  
              experiments on nutrient competition, salinity effects and
