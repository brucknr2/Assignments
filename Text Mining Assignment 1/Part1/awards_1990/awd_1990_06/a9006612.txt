Abstract    :
                   Theoretical studies of electron scattering processes                      
              involving the formation and decay of negative ions are                         
              proposed.  The problems investigated include, photodetachment                  
              of negative ions in external fields, thermal energy electron                   
              scattering by heavy alkalis, perturbation of Rydberg atoms by                  
              alkalis and inelastic processes in low energy electron                         
              scattering by hydrogen halide molecules.  The theoretical                      
              methods employed are an integral equations approach and the R-                 
              matrix theory.  All of the problems are quite relevant to                      
              current experimental investigations.
