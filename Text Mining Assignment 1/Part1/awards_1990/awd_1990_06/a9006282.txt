Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The major goal of this research is to investigate fundamental                  
              science associated with processing and molecular structure of                  
              compound semiconductor quantum dots embedded in glass matrices.                
              Quantum dot structures having nanometer size clusters of                       
              semiconducting materials (for example, cadmium telluride, gallium              
              arsenide, or indium phosphide) are formed by classical thermal                 
              treatments of glasses supersaturated with the semiconducting                   
              material, and by depositing the semiconducting materials from the              
              vapor phase onto glass with controlled pores.  Time and                        
              temperature parameters for deposition are determined using                     
              thermal analysis techniques, such as differential scanning                     
              calorimetry and differential thermal analysis.  The materials are              
              being characterized using small angle x-ray scattering, electron               
              microscopy, magic angle sample spinning nuclear magnetic                       
              resonance spectroscopy.
