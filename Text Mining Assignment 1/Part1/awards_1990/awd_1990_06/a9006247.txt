Abstract    :
                This proposed research addresses an areas of present interest                
              in the intercontinental academic networking community.  The                    
              United States' networking plant is built on a connectionless                   
              (datagram) service, and the European (and Japanese and other)                  
              plant(s) are based on connection-oriented service.  The                        
              implication is that even when we all use the international                     
              stantdard (ISO/OSI) protocols, our networks will not be able to                
              interwork unless the incompatibilities of the underlying network               
              services are bridged. A European - U.S. workshop addressing the                
              issue is scheduled for February, 1990.  The proposed effort would              
              produce an assessment of the state-of-the-art in bridging between              
              the two underlying network protocols, in time for use at the                   
              February meeting.  Such a paper could increase the chances of                  
              success of the workshop by getting all the attendees off to a                  
              fast start with a shared view of developments.***
