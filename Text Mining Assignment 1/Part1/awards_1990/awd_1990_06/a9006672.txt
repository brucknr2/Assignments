Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Bacic plans to develop                       
              methodologies for the accurate quantum mechanical treatment of                 
              rotating, vibrating molecules.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Accurate quantum descriptions of various static and dynamic                    
              properties of highly rovibrationally excited floppy molecules                  
              will be developed, with emphasis on strong coupling between the                
              high-J rotation and anharmonic large amplitude vibrations for                  
              three- and four-atom molecules.  Also to be performed are                      
              quantum studies of laser-induced isomerization in realistic                    
              multi-mode systems, by following the time evolution of the                     
              initial state, and a quantum 3D treatment of the                               
              photodissociation of highly vibrationally excited triatomic                    
              molecules.
