Abstract    :
              Planning for an idealized mobile robot includes planning physical              
              actions and planning to acquire knowledge by perception.  For                  
              human beings, natural language is an additional means of                       
              acquiring knowledge.  This work will investigate how a robot can               
              use language to acquire useful knowledge, and subsequently will                
              test the results of the investigation by simulating a robot that               
              can ask questions of a user.  The robot uses a coordinate system               
              defined by its own body - a self-centered coordinate system.  For              
              example, it might use a polar coordinate system in which the                   
              robot is always at the origin.  To grasp an object, the robot                  
              must know the coordinates of that object.  Natural language has                
              words like "left", "right", and "behind" to describe self-                     
              centered coordinates.  Gestures are also used- such as pointing                
              ad a door and saying "Go through that door".  Thus a user can                  
              give a robot the information it needs in order to find objects.                
              This work will develop a tool that will ultimately be useful to                
              robots.  It will also investigate how the meaning of an utterance              
              depends on the physical environment in which it occurs.
