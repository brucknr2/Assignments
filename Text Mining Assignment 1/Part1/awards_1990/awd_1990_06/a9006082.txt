Abstract    :
                   The proposed research has three major objectives:                         
              (1) To investigate the ecology of myxomycetes (Plasmodial slime                
              molds) associated with forest floor litter in temperate forest                 
              ecosystem.                                                                     
                   (2) To increase our knowledge of the relative importance and              
              exact role of myxomycetes as memebers of the detritus food chain.              
                   (3) To assess the ecological significance of their                        
              interactions with other organisms in terrestrial ecosystems.                   
                   Emphasis on the proposed research in on analyzing (using the              
              techniques of multivariate analysis) patterns of species                       
              composition and species diversity of myxomycetes in the litter                 
              microhabitat.  The proposed research, which is designed to                     
              include a number of undergraduate biology majors at the P.I.'s                 
              home institution as active participants, will provide important                
              new information about a critical but poorly known component of                 
              many forest ecosystem, and yield baseline data from which further              
              studies of myxomycete ecology can be launched.
