Abstract    :
              This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface                   
              chemistry and in the subfield of surface chemical and kinetic                  
              studies of molecular transformations at single crystal                         
              surfaces.  Professor Cynthia Friend of Harvard University will                 
              study the adsorption kinetics of alcohol and thiol molecules at                
              rhodium single crystal surfaces.  The understanding of this                    
              chemistry will advance the study of poisoning on catalyst                      
              surfaces.  The study of oxidation and sulfidation of surfaces                  
              from organometallic surface chemistry allows understanding of                  
              these surfaces for adhesion and corrosion protection.                          
                                                                                             
              Thiolate and alkoxide intermediate adsorption structure and                    
              kinetics will be studied using synchrotron radiation,                          
              photoemission and vibrational spectroscopies, in concert with                  
              temperature programmed desorption.  The effects of coverage                    
              induced changes in adsorbate structure and desorption kinetics                 
              will be followed.  The importance of the oxygen and sulfur                     
              heteroatom in C-O (S) linkages, vis a vis the Rh-O (S) bond                    
              strength will be investigated.  Kinetically important                          
              intermediates will be investigated.  Taken together, these                     
              studies will impact broadly on active metal surface chemistry                  
              applied to complex organic molecular adsorbates.
