Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This equipment grant will be used to purchase a hybrid resonant                
              column/torsional shear device for soil testing.  This test device              
              is capable of performing the resonant column test, a nondestructive            
              test to study the dynamic response of soils, and the torsional                 
              simple shear test on the same specimen.
