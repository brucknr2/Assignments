Abstract    :
                   The Flora Novo-Galiciana is intended as an authoritative                  
              taxonomic guide to the flowering plants, ferns, and conifers of a              
              biologically rich portion of western Mexico.  It provides a                    
              working tool for identification of and research on the                         
              approximately 7500 species of plants in this region of Jalisco                 
              and surrounding areas, ranging from sea beaches and tropical                   
              evergreen forest to semi-arid grasslands and mountain peaks that               
              ascend to timberline and above.  All species are provided                      
              detailed morphological description, an illustration of technical               
              features, full references to literature in which the species have              
              been treated, brief discussion about habitats and geographical                 
              range, vernacular names, economic values and uses.  There is no                
              complete such account of the plants of any other part of Mexico.               
                   Dr. Rogers McVaugh has been working on this inventory for                 
              over 40 years, amassing plant collections now deposited in                     
              herbaria in Mexico City and in several U.S. institutions.  Five                
              volumes have been published thus far, treating the legumes, the                
              orchids, the grasses, the sunflower family, and the bromeliads                 
              and some other monocots.  Remaining volumes being prepared will                
              treat ferns, conifers, and other dicot flowering plants.  The                  
              Flora is now used as a standard text in the School of Agriculture              
              of the University of Guadalajara, attesting to its immediate                   
              practicality, and is widely cited as a valuable reference work.                
              With assistance from his botanical colleague Dr. William                       
              Anderson, Dr. McVaugh continues to oversee the production of this              
              splendid inventory.
