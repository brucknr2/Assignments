Abstract    :
                   A critical factor in the commercial success of new products               
              is the speed of their development, a factor that in turn hinges                
              on the management of the early-stage product definition phase,                 
              research will devote particular attention to this phase of                     
              product development.  The research will examine the sources of                 
              market and technological data employed in this phase, as well as               
              the success with which product definition (which typically                     
              concludes with the development of functional specifications for a              
              new product) is integrated with the design of a new product.  The              
              management of product definition and its integration with design,              
              as well as the extent and nature of the databases and design                   
              tools used in the process, will then be related to product                     
              performance (measured in terms of return on investment, market                 
              share, break-even time, and other indexes).                                    
                   Following the collection of product histories and detailed                
              characterization of the product definition phases for each                     
              product, research will develop a generic framework for the                     
              conceptualization and analysis of product definition in different              
              technological and market environments.  This undertaking, as well              
              the analysis of the links between the management of product                    
              definition and design and product performance, will occupy the                 
              final stage of the project.
