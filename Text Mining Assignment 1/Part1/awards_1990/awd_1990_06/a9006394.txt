Abstract    :
                   Evidence from psychology and anthropology, together with                  
              advances in evolutionary theory, suggest an array of testable                  
              hypotheses about cross-cultural variations and similarities in                 
              standards of physical attractiveness.  This project will study                 
              criteria and consequences of physical attractiveness in the                    
              United States, among Ache Indians in Paraguay, and among urban                 
              and rural people in Brazil.  The project will test several                     
              current hypotheses about physical attractiveness: (1) There are                
              universal criteria of physical attractiveness related to age; (2)              
              the features considered attractive in a population are those                   
              closest to the mean for that population, and (3) selection may                 
              act to increase physical variability within populations via                    
              assortative mating and between populations via preference for                  
              exaggerated features.  The results of this research will help                  
              understand how standards of physical attractiveness develop and                
              the implications of this development for current human variation.
