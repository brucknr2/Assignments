Abstract    :
              This project is a collaborative study of flame assisted SiO2                   
              formation and deposition for use in the Outside Vapor                          
              Deposition (OVD) process of forming SiO2 boules for producing                  
              optical fiber.  An attractive new method, called Electrin                      
              Field Enhanced Deposition (EFED), to enhance the deposition                    
              rate of SiO2 using an electric field is a major topic of                       
              study.  The scientific goal of the research is to determine                    
              scaling laws for designing optimal flame configurations and                    
              for understanding the effect of operating parameters on the                    
              deposition process.  The methodology combines numerical and                    
              analytic modeling with experimental measurements.  Benefits of                 
              the research include an enhanced ability to predict the effect                 
              of changing operating parameters and geometry on the                           
              deposition rate and efficiency and the potential addition of a                 
              valuable new method for enhancing deposition.  Although the                    
              study focuses on the OVD process, the results should be                        
              valuable in obtaining an improved understanding of other                       
              silica deposition processes and configurations and other flame                 
              deposition processes such as silicon carbide surface hardening                 
              and titanium dioxide paint production.
