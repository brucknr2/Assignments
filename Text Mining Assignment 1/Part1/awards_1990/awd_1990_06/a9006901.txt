Abstract    :
              Michael Kellman is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                   
              and Computational Chemistry Program to investigate the dynamics                
              of highly excited vibrational states of small molecules.  These                
              studies are important in furthering our understanding of laser                 
              excitation of gas phase molecular species.  Kellman has also                   
              developed new analytical methods which will help to assign the                 
              complex spectra of molecules in highly excited vibrational                     
              states.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Kellman's research is divided into three major efforts:  1) The                
              development of new visualization techniques which are useful in                
              the semiclassical interpretation of experimental spectra; 2)                   
              The analysis of spectral patterns and signatures of phase                      
              structures which are present in complex spectra; and 3) An                     
              extended study of multidimensional phase space dynamics which                  
              will be used to search for the existence of pathways for                       
              controlled excitation of enhanced reactivity.
