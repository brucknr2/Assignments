Abstract    :
                   At the present time, many sheet metal products such as                    
              beverage cans are made from blanks cut out of sheet metal.                     
              Several processing steps are required to produce this sheet metal              
              from the metal.  Previous research conducted at the Colorado                   
              State University using a die and punch set has shown that it is                
              feasible to cast thin blanks directly from the melt.  This method              
              could potentially eliminate the costs related to sheet metal                   
              manufacturing.  However, further research is required to increase              
              the speed of blank casting to the level needed to be cost                      
              effective.  The requested research equipment will enable blank                 
              casting at higher speeds.  In addition, mechanical and                         
              microstructural properties of blanks cast at high speeds would be              
              investigated for further improvement in processing.
