Abstract    :
              This Grant for Exploratory Research is in the general area of                  
              analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of mass                   
              spectrometry.  Professor Peter Williams of Arizona State                       
              University will study the production of molecular ion species                  
              from laser volatilization of frozen aqueous matrices of DNA.                   
              The goal is to minimize the fragmentation of the DNA and                       
              preserve the molecular weight distribution of the biological                   
              molecule.  The development of a suitable means to use mass                     
              spectrometry to sequence biological molecules will result.                     
                                                                                             
              Via the use of a novel energy deposition mechanism, both the                   
              absorptivity and the phase transformation thermodynamics of the                
              matrix are used to preserve structure.  The construction of a                  
              high resolution flight tube for time of flight mass                            
              spectrometry will allow immediate understanding of the role of                 
              laser energy deposition parameters on the minimization of                      
              fragmentation.
