Abstract    :
                   Experimental investigations are carried out directed to                   
              demonstrating that positive gain may be achieved in a uranium Nd-              
              like soft x-ray laser.  A successful demonstration could lead to               
              realization of an x-ray laser at 70 A, which would be an                       
              important new tool in photobiology, x-ray crystallography,                     
              materials research, and x-ray laser assisted processing.
