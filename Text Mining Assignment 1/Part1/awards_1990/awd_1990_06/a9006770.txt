Abstract    :
                   Recent studies have made progress in determining how, when,               
              and to what extent zooplankton, especially calanoid copepods, use              
              taste to discriminate between food particles which differ in                   
              nutritional quality.  The first goal of this proposal is to                    
              develop mechanistic models of algal consumption which integrate                
              the effects of taste and size selective feeding.  The second goal              
              is to use Diaptomus and Daphnia as models for testing the                      
              implications of contrasting feeding modes for grazer-                          
              phytoplankton interactions and zooplankton competition.                        
                   These basic problems will be attacked using field and                     
              laboratory experiments representing a range of time scales and                 
              degrees of experimental control.  Food selection experiments will              
              focus on a new question: concentration-variable selection and                  
              ingestion of large, difficult-to-handle phytoplankton by                       
              behaviorally flexible grazers.  Both short and long-term grazer                
              manipulation will be used to compare and contrast the impacts of               
              grazing by Diaptomus and Daphnia on natural phytoplankton                      
              assemblages.  The possibility of positive interactions through                 
              complementary feeding niches ("indirect mutualism"), a                         
              potentially important stabilizing factor in zooplankton                        
              communities, will be tested for the first time through growth and              
              competition experiments with Diaptomus and Daphnia.//
