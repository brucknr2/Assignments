Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award will support the planning activities for the                   
              development of the Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics Initiative                 
              of the NSF Global Geoscience Program and the U.S. Global Change                
              Program for a period of two years.  This initiative will                       
              address the role of physical ocean processes in the variability                
              of populations of animals in the world's oceans and thereby                    
              assess the potential influences of changing global climate on                  
              animal abundance, distribution and production.  Support will be                
              used for workshops on technology conceptualization, theory and                 
              model international development and coordination of GLOBEC                     
              research; and for publications of the initiative.
