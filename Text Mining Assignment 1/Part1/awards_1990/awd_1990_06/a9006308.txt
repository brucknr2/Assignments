Abstract    :
                   This project deals with a selection of theoretical and                    
              numerical aspects for certain classes of parabolic partial                     
              differential equations.  Determination of surface temperature and              
              heat flux from a finite set of interior temperature                            
              measurements, stable under noisy data will be investigated.                    
              Theoretical and numerical analysis of methods involving                        
              eigenfunction expansions of initial data and Whittaker Cardinal                
              expansions of initial and boundary data will be studied.  In this              
              part of the work, the investigator will employ more standard                   
              regularization techniques for recovering the Fourier coefficients              
              of initial data.  However, the stability of the numerical                      
              inversion based on Whittaker Cardinal expansions is novel.  In                 
              this approach, the problem of choosing a regularizing parameter                
              as in standard  approaches no longer exists.  However, the                     
              "regularizing" necessary for this method takes the form of an                  
              appropriate choice of the number of spatial sensors and the                    
              sampling time, both of  which have been completely determined in               
              recent work for special cases.  A further regularization is                    
              obtained by a suitable apriori restriction of the class of                     
              initial data appropriate to Sinc Expansions.
