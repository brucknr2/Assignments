Abstract    :
                   This research is in the area of group representation theory.              
              The principal investigator will develop an algebraic harmonic                  
              analysis to transfer the representation theory of semisimple                   
              groups to the representation theory of Hecke algebras.                         
                   The central problem to be considered in this project is the               
              Lusztig conjecture which states that certain invariants attached               
              to an algebraic group can be calculated from polynomials.  This                
              is a difficult and central problem in group theory.  It also has               
              implications in other areas of mathematics.
