Abstract    :
              This Engineering Research Equipment award will permit the                      
              purchase of a laser and related equipment for use in an                        
              ongoing research program in turbulent mixing layers and their                  
              modification by the compressibility due to high Mach numbers.                  
              The other is focused on low speed flows and seeks to further                   
              resolve their underlying spatial and temporal organized                        
              geometrical structures.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Both areas will provide data necessary in the development of                   
              improved models to predict the behavior of turbulent flows in                  
              a variety of mechanical, chemical, and thermal systems.
