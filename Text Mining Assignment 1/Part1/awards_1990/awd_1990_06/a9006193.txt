Abstract    :
              The purpose of this continued research effort is to develop a                  
              animation (simulation) technique for construction site layout and              
              operations optimization.  A experimental 3-D graphics tool will be             
              developed for use in assessing the value of computer animation in              
              construction site activities; that is, quantitative reporting of               
              user activities and resource utilization.  Such reporting                      
              capability will make possible the scientific evaluation of computer            
              animation functionality.  It would also act as an educational tool             
              that could be used for pedagogical purposes as well as to identify             
              future construction site research problems.
