Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant is in the areas of engineering and analytical                       
              chemistry and in the subarea of chromatography.  Professor                     
              Lochmuller will study the design and application of a                          
              continuous, open-channel, isoelectric focusing system that                     
              will separate ampholytes of broad size scale using thermally                   
              produced pH gradients.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This research will aim to develop both batch and continuous                    
              isoelectric focusing systems whose separating capabilities                     
              will arise from thermally produced pH gradients.  The long-                    
              term impact of this research will be in the development of                     
              simple, preparative isoelectric focusing instruments, as                       
              opposed to existing analytical instruments, that are capable                   
              of resolving and efficiently separating both large proteins                    
              and whole cells.
