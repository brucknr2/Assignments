Abstract    :
                   On western sides of ocean basins are strong boundary layers               
              which transport water and heat poleward and equatorward.  Many                 
              conceptual models have been developed to understand these                      
              processes.  This effort will focus on simplified models of the                 
              boundary layer and include topographic and inertial effects.   As              
              a related issue, dispersion of properties will be investigated.                
              They are dependent on the level of turbulence which is controlled              
              by instabilities of the boundary flow.
