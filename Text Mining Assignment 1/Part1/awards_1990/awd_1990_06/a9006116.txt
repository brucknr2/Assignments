Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in algebraic geometry of                 
              Professors Henry Pinkham, Robert Friedman, and David Bayer of                  
              Columbia University. Drs. Pinkham and Bayer intend to mount a                  
              computational and theoretical attack on one of the most resistant              
              problems of modern mathematics, the Jacobian Conjecture. Dr.                   
              Friedman's project involves an ongoing investigation into the                  
              structure of moduli spaces of stable vector bundles on an                      
              algebraic surface.                                                             
                   Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern                   
              mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in                
              the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that               
              could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely                
              polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only                  
              from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is                
              finding application in those fields as well as in physics,                     
              theoretical computer science, and robotics.
