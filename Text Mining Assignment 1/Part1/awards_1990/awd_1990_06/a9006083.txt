Abstract    :
                   Comparative studies form a major part of modern biology.                  
              Typically, several species are compared with regard to two or                  
              more traits, such as brain size and body size, limb length and                 
              running speed, or dentition and diet.  Significant associations                
              between traits generally are inferred by applying standard                     
              statistical tests.  Unfortunately, standard tests are not                      
              appropriate for comparative studies.  This is so because species               
              do not represent statistically independent data points.                        
                   Recently, several methodologies have been proposed which                  
              take the non-independence of species values into account and                   
              hence allow appropriate statistical tests for evolutionary                     
              relationships between continuous traits.  These methods make                   
              explicit use of the known evolutionary (phylogenetic)                          
              relationships among species.  The proposed research compares the               
              statistical efficacy of several such methods by determining how                
              well they perform in the analysis of computer-simulated data with              
              known properties.
