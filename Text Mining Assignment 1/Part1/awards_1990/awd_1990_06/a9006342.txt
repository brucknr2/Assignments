Abstract    :
                   Dr. Daniel Young will be studying the fire-colored beetles                
              of the genus Pseudopyrochroa.  This is a diverse group whose                   
              species-level taxonomy and evolution are poorly understood.  Dr.               
              Young will be studying museum collections, and amassing a unique               
              database concerning larval and adult traits.  These data will                  
              lead to significant advances in our understanding of their                     
              evolutionary and biogeographic history.                                        
                   Basic "alpha-level" studies such as this one are the                      
              essential first steps in understanding the biodiversity of an                  
              organismal group.  Without such fundamental research, subsequent               
              studies of physiology, behavior, ecology, and evolution cannot                 
              proceed.  This study will be a significant contribution to our                 
              understanding of the beetles, which are the most diverse living                
              group on earth.
