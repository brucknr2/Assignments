Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The focus of this proposal is the experimental examination of                  
              lipid exchange rates between 'gel- and 'fluid-like' lipid                      
              clusters in membranes using model membrane systems.                            
              Theoretical modeling of lipid dynamics suggest that long range                 
              thermodynamic fluctuations of lipid chain conformations are                    
              responsible for several important membrane phenomena such as                   
              enhanced passive transport of sodium ion through the bilayer                   
              at the lipid 'melt' temperature and increased two-dimensional                  
              lateral diffusion rates.  However little direct experimental                   
              evidence of lipid structural fluctuations is available.                        
              Submicrosecond lipid reorientational processes which exists in                 
              the bilayer may be studied using polarized fluorescence                        
              measurements.  The fluorescence 'time-window' can be extended                  
              to span this critical submicrosecond region, by using                          
              fluorescence probes with lifetimes on the order of several                     
              hundreds of nanoseconds to detect submicrosecond acyl-chain                    
              motions.  This extended submicrosecond time window, which has                  
              not previously been explored, may provide the key to                           
              understanding important lipid membrane mediated events e.g.ion                 
              transport, fusion and membrane signaling.
