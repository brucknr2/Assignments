Abstract    :
              The equipment to be purchased is a 300 kip capacity                            
              tension testing machine with accompanying equipment for                        
              data recording and acquisition.  The primary use of the                        
              testing machine will be for determining the tension                            
              properties (yield stress and strain, strain hardening                          
              strain, ultimate strength, etc.) of reinforcing bars used                      
              in experimental research projects.  The tension testing                        
              machine will also be used to test tension coupons from                         
              rolled steel sections and tests of prestressing strands.                       
              The range of projects which will make use of this machine                      
              include tests of reinforced concrete frame elements,                           
              connections and subassemblies; tests of steel bracing                          
              elements used for either braced steel frames or as                             
              strengthening elements for nonductile concrete frames; and                     
              tests of precast prestressed concrete frame and bridge                         
              elements.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This equipment will provide for experimental testing which                     
              will advance the knowledge base of earthquake engineering.
