Abstract    :
              The proposed project compromises an experimental and                           
              theoretical study of the plasma preparation of fine powders                    
              suitable for the processing of ceramics.  The effects of                       
              cooling rates and reactant concentrations on particle                          
              nucleation and growth will be investigated.  A special                         
              apparatus will be used to conduct experiments in which several                 
              substances are nucleated from the gas phase.  On-line particle                 
              size and number density measurements will be performed.                        
              Discrete-based models and moment models will be developed for                  
              the nucleation rate of liquid and solid particles.                             
                                                                                             
              The proposed research will advance the theory of particle                      
              production in plasma reactors, and the predictions of powder                   
              quality as a function of the processing parameters can be used                 
              to optimize their design.
