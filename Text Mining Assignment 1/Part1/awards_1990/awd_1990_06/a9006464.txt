Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will investigate three aspects of              
              statistical inference for time series models:  iterative methods               
              of estimation for incomplete dependent data, non-linear time                   
              series analysis, forecasting with a possibly misspecified model.               
              The non-linear time series analysis represents a continuation of               
              the investigator's work on a flexible class of threshold                       
              autoregressive models, where the relationship between stability                
              and ergodicity of some time series models will be investigated.                
              The work on estimation for incomplete dependent data will                      
              involve algorithm development.                                                 
                   The principal investigator is working on various problems in              
              time series analysis.  Time series analysis is used to model                   
              situations were data are sequential and dependent.  Current                    
              interest is to develope a class of models that account for non-                
              linearities in real data.  Another area of investigation will                  
              involve situations were data are incomplete.  This again                       
              represents a situation that can occur in real data.
