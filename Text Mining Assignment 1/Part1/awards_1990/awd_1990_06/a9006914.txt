Abstract    :
                   The area of coating is of very high economic importance to                
              this country and the need to increase the scientific knowledge base            
              through research in this field is well known.  Although coatings               
              technology is evolving from an art to a science, much of today's               
              coatings development is still done by empirical methods.  The                  
              coating technologist relies less on firmly based scientific                    
              principles and more on his/her own judgement and/or data base of               
              information of actual performance of coatings in the field.  The               
              data base may be large and sophisticated, but it is empirical.                 
              Empirical methods have yielded slow, steady progress but                       
              breakthroughs and innovations have been rare.  Given the                       
              competitiveness of the world market, and the pressures to find                 
              pollution free coatings, a center directed toward scientific                   
              studies of coating is highly desirable.  The establishment of a                
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for                   
              Coatings Research is an ideal part of the solution of the problem.             
              Eastern Michigan University proposes to form an I/UCRC for Coatings            
              Research to attack the limits of coating technology.                           
                   This award initiates an I/UCRC on Coatings Research at Eastern            
              Michigan University.  The initial research will focus in the areas             
              of VOC reduction, corrosion protection, cross-linking, film                    
              mechanical properties and water-borne coatings.  The Coatings                  
              Research Center has excellent research instrumentation and                     
              facilities, provided by grants from the State of Michigan of almost            
              $1,000,000.                                                                    
                   Eight companies and the State of Michigan have agreed to                  
              provide $30,000 per year to support this research.                             
                   The Program Manager recommends that Eastern Michigan be                   
              awarded $50,000 per year for a five year continuing grant.                     
                   Near the end of each 12 month period the program manager                  
              and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review            
              the progress of the center on a number of criteria, including the              
              following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                    
              interaction and collaboration is developing; (2)  The extent to                
              which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                 
              robust research program is developing.  If the review is                       
              satisfactory, the program manager will recommend support of the                
              next period of this continuing grant.
