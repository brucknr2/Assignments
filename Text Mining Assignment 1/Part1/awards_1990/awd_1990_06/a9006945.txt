Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will continue his research on                  
              several topics in the dynamics of continua.  In particular, he                 
              will study continuum and kinetic theories of material motion                   
              undergoing phase transitions, initial value problems for the                   
              Riemann problem for systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, and               
              distributed-parameter control systems.  The tools used will be                 
              various techniques from the qualitative theory of partial                      
              differential equations and from nonlinear analysis.                            
              Many natural phenomena involve the transition of a material from               
              one phase to another.  As an example, think of what happens to                 
              the ice cubes in your drink.  The principal investigator will                  
              apply modern methods of nonlinear analysis to study the dynamical              
              behavior of materials undergoing phase transitions and also ways               
              to control the instabilities that often result when materials are              
              stressed.
