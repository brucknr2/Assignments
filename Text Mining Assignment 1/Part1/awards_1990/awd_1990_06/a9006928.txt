Abstract    :
                   This project will partially support the research visits of                
              U.S. scholars in the mathematical sciences to the Institut des                 
              Hautes Etudes Scientifiques (IHES) in Bures-sur-Yvette, France.                
              This international institute is comparable to the Institute for                
              Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey and, in addition to                    
              support from the National Science Foundation, is supported in                  
              part by science agencies in a number of other countries.                       
                   Areas of research at the IHES include algebraic geometry and              
              number theory, group representations and invariants, harmonic                  
              analysis, convex sets and analysis, geometry and topology,                     
              discrete groups in relation with algebra, differential geometry,               
              dynamical systems, and ergodic theory, and general relativity and              
              cosmology.
