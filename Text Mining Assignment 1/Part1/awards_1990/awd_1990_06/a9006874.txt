Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal addresses the adsorption at S-L interface on oxides,             
              in the presence of appropriate liquids, by Infrared (IR) and UV-               
              Visible (UV-Vis) Total Attenuated Reflection spectroscopy.                     
              Particular emphasis will be placed on identification of the species            
              and conditions present at such interfaces.  It is planned to                   
              examine how  a) the reactivity of adsorbed species may be different            
              in the interfacial region, due to excess concentration, steric                 
              constraints, and anisotropic polarity; and b) how changes in                   
              conformation, tautomerization, oligomerization, or ionization                  
              equilibria will affect kinetics.
