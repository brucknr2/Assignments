Abstract    :
                   Cellular automata are useful paradigms for representing and               
              analyzing spatial patterns and dynamics.  And they have                        
              potential for investigating relationships between spatial                      
              processes and patterns at various scales and levels of                         
              organization in ecology.  Various grid-cell schema have been                   
              applied in ecological research (e.g. succession, landscapes,                   
              biogeography), but generally lack the theoretical formalism of                 
              cellular automata.  Cellular automata may be particularly useful               
              for understanding how ecological complexity can arise from                     
              relatively simple local interactions.  Dr. Rykiel proposes to:                 
              (1) evaluate available cellular automata tools (especially the                 
              CAM-6 computer board), (2) investigate potential applications of               
              cellular automata in various areas of ecology, and (3) test                    
              cellular automata models with primary succession data for lupin                
              (Lupinus lepidus) at Mount St. Helens.  This research is an                    
              attempt to apply a new, untested approach to traditional areas of              
              ecological research.
