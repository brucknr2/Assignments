Abstract    :
              The requested high intensity rotating anode x-ray                              
              generator will be used in conjunction with existing x-                         
              ray diffraction instrumentation at the University of                           
              Wisconsin-Madison to study the effect of material                              
              processing on the defect structure in semiconductors                           
              such as CdTe, GaAs, and silicon.  Three research                               
              programs that will utilize this x-ray source are:                              
              (1) The magnitude and origin of surface polish damage                          
              in GaAs (2) The effect of Bridgman crystal growth on the                       
              defect structures in bulk II-VI semiconductors (3) The                         
              evolution of surface and subsurface damage during the                          
              reactive ion etching of silicon and GaAs.
