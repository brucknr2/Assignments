Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The conference proposed will bring together most of the                   
              world's leading experts on the locus coereleus to summarize and                
              disseminate the major research accomplishments in this area of                 
              research.  The conference is important and it is the first time                
              that such a comprehensive conference on this topic has been put                
              together.  It may become a landmark in the field of motor systems              
              and central noradrenergic innervation research.
