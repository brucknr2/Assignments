Abstract    :
              Parallel  algorithms will be developed, on a Intel                             
              iPPSC-D5 Hypercube, for the finite element                                     
              numerical solution of free-boundary seepage                                    
              problems using unstructured meshes and for the                                 
              determination of the load balance and communication                            
              structure among the processors.  The goal will be to                           
              develop load balancing strategies which will assign                            
              tasks among the processors to optimize the overall                             
              computational efficiency.  Several domain splitting                            
              techniques will be used and evaluated including a                              
              relatively recent one developed by Italian researchers                         
              at the University of Pavia.  Furthermore, scale up                             
              performance experiments will be performed on                                   
              various systems both at University California Santa                            
              Barbara as well as at the University of Pavia.  The                            
              knowledge and tools developed will provide                                     
              techniques for the efficient solution of both free-                            
              boundary problems as well as the use of finite-                                
              element schemes.
