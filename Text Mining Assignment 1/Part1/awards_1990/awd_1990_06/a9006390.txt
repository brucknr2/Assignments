Abstract    :
                   Research is concerned with the role of statistical design,                
              modeling, and analysis in quality engineering.  Because                        
              industrial experimentation is usually expensive, emphasis is                   
              given to techniques and strategies which minimize experimental                 
              effort, and maximize information gained from analysis of results.              
              Central topics are: reduction of variation; designing products                 
              robust to transmitted variation and to environmental variation;                
              modeling control processes to achieve better understanding of the              
              roles and possible conflicts between statistical process control               
              and automatic process control; developing bases for choosing                   
              standards and; data-based prediction of possible future upsets.
