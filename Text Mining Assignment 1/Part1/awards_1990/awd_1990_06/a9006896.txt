Abstract    :
                   Surveys of genetic variation in natural populations of                    
              marine organisms, particularly bivalves, have revealed a curious               
              paradox:  many genes show a deficiency of heterozygotes compared               
              to frequencies expected under population genetic theory, yet at                
              the same time heterozygous individuals appear to enjoy enhanced                
              growth and survival.  The reasons for this situation can only be               
              understood by controlled laboratory experiments.                               
                   In this project, over a hundred families of the coot clam,                
              Mulinia lateralis, will be produced and reared in the laboratory.              
              By comparing the genotypes of the parents and offspring in each                
              family for a series of genes, the investigators will be able to                
              determine the origin(s) of the numerical deficiency  and enhanced              
              fitness of heterozygote.  One potential source is spontaneous                  
              chromosomal aberrations (aneuploidy) of the same type that cause               
              a large proportion of birth defects in humans.  If this proves to              
              be the case, marine bivalves could become valuable model systems               
              for the study of aneuploidy.  Alternatively, if the fitness                    
              differences are attributable to biochemical differences in the                 
              gene products, this finding will further aid our understanding of              
              the evolutionary significance of genetic variation in natural                  
              populations.
