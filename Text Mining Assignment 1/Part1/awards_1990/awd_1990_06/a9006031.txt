Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to gain a better                         
              understanding of the application of quantum mechanics to the                   
              entire universe.  In particular, what does quantum mechanics                   
              imply for the size and shape of the universe, for the                          
              properties of small wormholes which may connect otherwise                      
              disconnected large regions of spacetime, for the process of                    
              black-hole formation and evaporation, and for the arrow of                     
              time?  The methods used to attack these questions will be,                     
              among others, a theoretical study of complex classical                         
              solutions of Einstein's equations as a basis for a                             
              semiclassical quantum analysis, a construction of model                        
              universe and wormhole wavefunctions and density matrices based                 
              on these classical solutions and on other mathematical                         
              techniques, and an analysis of the entropy of conditional                      
              density matrices and how it changes as the condition                           
              representing time is changed.  The project will have the                       
              significance of advancing our scientific knowledge of the unity                
              of nature as a single quantum mechanical universe.
