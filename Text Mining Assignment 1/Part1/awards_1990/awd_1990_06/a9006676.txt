Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research will be carried out in electromagnetic nuclear                        
              physics at the CEBAF laboratory.  The principal focus will                     
              be on instrumentation development for an experiment to                         
              study the photodisintegration of the deuteron at high                          
              energies.  Signatures for the presence and effect of quark                     
              degrees of freedom are sought in this study.  The CEBAF                        
              High Momentum Spectrometer will be used for proton                             
              detection; and the detector package, specifically the                          
              drift chambers, will be the Hampton University group's                         
              contribution to the large collaboration formed to carry                        
              out the experiment.
