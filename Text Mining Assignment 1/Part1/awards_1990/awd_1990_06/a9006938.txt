Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research award will purchase a portable micro-               
              computer, printer, and supplies to aid the research of an                      
              anthropology graduate student in Jamaica.  The student's research              
              is also supported by a Wenner-Gren and a Fulbright award.  The                 
              project is to analyze the interactions between men and women in a              
              relatively new "Family Court" run by the Jamaican government to                
              assure child support.  Using participant observation, analysis of              
              court records and detailed case studies, interviews and cognitive              
              tests, and birth registration data, the student will analyze how               
              this recent legal structure is affecting gender relations.  The                
              project will study how the definition of "father" is changing in               
              response to these new laws, and whether the changing legal                     
              definition of out-of-wedlock infants has affected the felt                     
              responsibilities of men and women towards marriage and children.               
                                                                                             
              The increase in children born out of wedlock is dramatic in many               
              countries in the world.  Increased understanding of how legal                  
              structures affect young people's values and behavior will help                 
              planners cope with these changing social patterns.
