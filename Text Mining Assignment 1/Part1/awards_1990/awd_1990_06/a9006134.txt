Abstract    :
                   Nonlinear nonautonomous differential equations have                       
              attracted the attention of many mathematicians and mathematical                
              scientists.  The description and modeling of physical phenomena                
              frequently involve such equations.  Progress has not been easy                 
              but topological and variational methods have been relatively                   
              successful in yielding existence and multiplicity information                  
              regarding boundary value problems and periodic solutions.                      
              However, progress has been much slower in our understanding of                 
              the dynamics of such systems. Many classes of these problems have              
              a rather sparse literature, perhaps due to the fact that the                   
              topological degree and variational methods usually yield little                
              or no information on dynamics.  The proposed research will                     
              develop a unified approach to these difficulties through the                   
              application of homotopy index theory and analytical methods to                 
              parameter dependent skew product flows associated with the                     
              nonautonomous differential equations,as well as topological                    
              degree, semigroup methods, and monotone iterative techniques.                  
              Continuation methods for asymptotic stability, existence of                    
              bounded solutions and other dynamical questions will be                        
              developed.
