Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Crassulacean Acid Metabolism is an intriguing photosynthetic pathway           
              that interacts with a number of environmental factors including water          
              stress.  The general objective of this proposal is to understand the           
              compartmentation and regulation of mitochondrial malic acid metabolism         
              in succulent plants with Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM).                   
              Specifically, regulation of malic acid metabolism in mitochondria              
              during acidification and deacidification will be examined using in vivo        
              tracer flux analysis and in vitro studies of mitochondrial metabolism.         
              On-line methods for monitoring 18O fractionation will be developed to          
              determine the importance of the alternative respiration pathway for            
              malate fluxes during the CAM process.                                          
                                                                                             
              This research will improve understanding of the physiological                  
              regulation of CAM metabolism, a biochemical pathway that apparently            
              helps certain plant species respond to environmental stress.  The              
              results will also be applicable to other physiological processes in            
              which malic acid plays a key role such as generation of osmotic                
              pressure during stomatal opening and ionic balance during nutrient             
              uptake and incorporation.  Finally this research will develop direct           
              measurements of alternative pathway respiration, a key physiological           
              response thought to provide plants with flexibility in the face of             
              environmental fluctuation.
