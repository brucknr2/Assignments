Abstract    :
              This project supports the procurement of equipment needed                      
              to enhance research on material and structural damping                         
              research.  The goal is to improve the understanding of the                     
              phenomenon of passive damping, one of the most poorly                          
              understood characteristics of structural behavior.  The                        
              primary research projects address the development of finite                    
              element analysis techniques for modeling frequency                             
              dependent dynamic behavior and high damping structural                         
              materials, and techniques for measuring damping of                             
              individual structural elements at very low frequencies.                        
              There is the potential for using the equipment on related                      
              projects as well.  The equipment comprises an experiment                       
              control computer, intelligent instruments, non interfering                     
              force and motion transducers, and laboratory apparatus for                     
              studying precision structural dynamic behavior and its                         
              dependence on temperature, frequency, amplitude, and                           
              ambient pressure.
