Abstract    :
                   Dr. Robert Baker, at Texas Tech University, is undertaking a              
              multi-faceted study of a hybrid zone between two chromosomal                   
              races or subspecies of the white-footed deer mouse, Peromyscus                 
              leucopis, focused on hybrid dysgenesis. Preliminary data indicate              
              that variation in DNA content and frequency of chromosomal                     
              aberrations is heightened in the hybrid zone. A goal of the                    
              research is to determine the genetic basis of this dysgenesis.                 
              This will be accomplished by controlled genetic crosses in the                 
              laboratory and the comparison of measures of dysgenesis between                
              the progeny of these crosses and measures made in naturally                    
              occurring populations. The distribution of two DNA sequences, K18              
              and mys will also be examined in parental and hybrid animals. Mys              
              is a retrovirus-like transposable element and k18 is a satellite               
              DNA associated with heterochromatic regions of chromosomes. Dr.                
              Baker hypothesizes a relationship between DNA content variation,               
              chromosomal aberrations, and changes in the genomic                            
              distributions of mys and k18 sequences, all resulting from hybrid              
              dysgenesis. This study will provide insight to the genetic                     
              changes that occur as new species are formed.
