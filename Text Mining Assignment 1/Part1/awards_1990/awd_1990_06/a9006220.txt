Abstract    :
                   This research involves the efficient and accurate numerical               
              solution of inverse problems by means of the construction of                   
              improved potential functions and the application of wavelets.                  
              In an inverse problem one tries to reconstruct an equation from                
              information about its solutions, and this leads to difficult                   
              problems in numerical linear algebra, since for a large system                 
              the reconstruction must be done on a computer.                                 
                   It may seem strange but very often one has solutions to a                 
              problem without knowing exactly what the problem is itself.                    
              Think of the case where your doctor takes X-rays of you during an              
              examination in order to find out if anything is amiss.  The data               
              from the X-rays are essentially like the solutions, whereas the                
              problem in this case might be an unknown malady.  Your doctor                  
              tries to determine what particular condition ?equation! is                     
              producing the data ?solutions!. In much the same spirit the                    
              principal investigator will study numerical techniques for                     
              determining the equations that are producing certain types of                  
              solutions.
