Abstract    :
              A scanning tunneling microscope facility will be established                   
              to study (1) the formation of smooth ultrathin metal films,                    
              (2) nanometer scale direct writing, and (3) restructuring on                   
              metal surfaces during catalysis.  The facility will be used                    
              for a series of research projects on nanometer diameter metal                  
              clusters, cluster-beam-deposition process, chemical vapor                      
              deposition, and production of ultrathin films.                                 
                                                                                             
              The project has important technological applications in the                    
              fabrication of microelectronics, high quality optical mirrors                  
              and high density digital memories.
