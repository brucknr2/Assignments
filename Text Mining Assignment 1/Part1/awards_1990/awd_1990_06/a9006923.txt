Abstract    :
              This workshop will identify AI knowledge representation                        
              technology which is ready for standardization.  It will further                
              initiate the development of standards for the areas deemed                     
              appropriate.  For areas which presently are considered untargeted              
              for standardization, attempts will be undertaken to define the                 
              remaining problems and issues that need solution to meet a                     
              minimum level of consistency that will allow standardization.                  
              The overall goal is to enhance the effective use of related                    
              software by the entire research and commerical community.
