Abstract    :
              The principal investigators, in collaboration with Alan Zindler                
              at Columbia University, will attempt to develop a quartz                       
              geochronometer and geothermometer.  He will do so by examining                 
              the number of Schottky-Frenkel defects in natural quartz using                 
              electron spin resonance spectroscopy, then determining the age of              
              the quartz via improved uranium-thorium dating techniques,                     
              thereby establishing the rate of accumulation of the defects.                  
              Through annealing experiments a study also will be made of the                 
              thermal stabilities and mean lives of the defects; this in turn                
              could provide a basis for a geologically useful geochronometer.                
              Since quartz is a common minerals, development of this tool could              
              have wide application, and would be particularly useful for rocks              
              in which other methods cannot be applied.  The understanding of                
              defects in quartz also will benefit the semiconductor industry.
