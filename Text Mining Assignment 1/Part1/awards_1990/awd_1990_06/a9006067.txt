Abstract    :
                   The maintenance of male plants and plants possessing both                 
              male and female reproductive organs in a single species has been               
              termed androdioecy.  However, several plant scientists have                    
              suggested that it is theoretically very difficult for this                     
              reproductive system to exist in nature.  In fact, not one                      
              androdioecious species had been documented prior to current work.              
              Dr. Rieseberg and his colleagues have recently demonstrated that               
              the plant species Datisca glomerata is androdioecious and propose              
              the determine how this reproductive system originated and how it               
              is being maintained.                                                           
                   Because Datisca glomerata is the only plant species known to              
              be androdioecious, it will provide a model system for studies in               
              the field of plant biology.  Basic scientific questions can be                 
              addressed using this model system:  1)  how do different                       
              reproductive systems in plants evolve and how are they                         
              maintained?  2)  how can one reproductive system be changed to                 
              another?  and 3)  what is the genetic or environmental basis for               
              this  change?                                                                  
                   These questions are important for basic plant ecologists,                 
              but are also relevant to breeders trying to improve existing crop              
              plants or trying to develop new agriculturally  important plants.              
              For example, a species that has both male and female plants is                 
              quite inefficient as a crop plant because only 50% of the plants               
              will bear fruit.  Understanding reproductive system evolution is               
              also important for the maintenance of biodiversity.  Changes in                
              reproductive system can alter species stability and potentially                
              lead to their extinction.
