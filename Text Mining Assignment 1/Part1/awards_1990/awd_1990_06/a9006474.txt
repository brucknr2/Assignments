Abstract    :
                   Orchids constitute the largest family of monocots, with an                
              estimated 20,000 species arranged in ca. 700 genera.  Growing                  
              worldwide, most commonly in the tropics, they are renowned for                 
              the color and variety of their flowers and the intricacy of their              
              pollinating mechanisms with insects and birds.  Less well                      
              appreciated is the diversity of vegetative structures among                    
              orchids (roots, stems, and leaves), making possible their growth               
              in a wide range of habitats, often quite specialized, including                
              epiphytes upon other woody plants, subterranean forms, bulbs,                  
              vines, and shrubs.  Dr. William Stern of the University of                     
              Florida is surveying the vegetative diversity of orchids to                    
              compile the first encyclopedic account of root, stem, and leaf                 
              anatomy of representatives of all 700 genera of the world's                    
              orchids.                                                                       
                   Working with colleagues in Florida and at the Kew Botanic                 
              Gardens in England, Dr. Stern will have access to living and                   
              preserved materials of all recognized orchid genera.  Microscopic              
              examination of slide preparations will allow standard comparisons              
              across all the genera.  In turn, comparative study will                        
              facilitate an evaluation of the range of environmental                         
              modifications found in orchid structures, and allow                            
              discrimination between homologous structures (those with a common              
              genetic and developmental basis) from analogous structures                     
              (those that look similar in mature form but develop along                      
              different pathways).  This first comprehensive survey of orchid                
              vegetative anatomy will enhance further systematic, ecological,                
              and morphological study of these fascinating plants.
