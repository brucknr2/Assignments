Abstract    :
              Two on-going research projects; (1) Computer Simulation                        
              of hyperthermic Cancer Therapy and (2) Hydrodynamic                            
              Simulations of Continental Shelf Oceanography share a                          
              common need for high performance graphics                                      
              workstations - both require the construction, display, and                     
              the manipulation of complex geometrical models for                             
              three-dimensional finite element analysis.  The limitations                    
              imposed by conventional two-dimensional projections of                         
              three-dimensional objects necessitates that graphical                          
              processing occur in real-time in order to verify data input                    
              and analyze data output.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The hyperthermia research involves the construction of                         
              three-dimensional anatomical models of the human body                          
              as computational domains which are used to analyze                             
              understand and define adequate thermal dose delivery.                          
              The hydrodynamic numerical studies focuses on selected                         
              oceanographic processes such as tides and currents and                         
              their effects on temperature profiles, nutrient                                
              distributions as well as other environmental factors.                          
              Detailed geometrical representations of the complex                            
              waterways, e.g. Gulf of Maine, Alboran Sea, etc., are                          
              necessary for accurate simulations.                                            
                                                                                             
              Despite the distinctively different phenomenon involved                        
              both research projects share the feature that the fine                         
              geometrical details have a major influence on the                              
              computed results.  The action provides partial support                         
              for the purchase of a Silicon-Graphics IRIS graphics                           
              workstation which will be networked with the existing                          
              computational resources within the Numerical Methods                           
              Laboratory of the Thayer School.
