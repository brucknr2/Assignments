Abstract    :
                   A principal aim of the proposal work is to understand the                 
              evolution of interactions between a herbivorous insect and                     
              several of its host plants.  Although it is generally accepted                 
              that insects evolve in response to selection pressures mediated                
              by plants, the role of insects attack as a cause of plant                      
              evolution is controversial.  The P.I.'s propose to initiate a                  
              preliminary investigation of this role, using the butterfly                    
              Euphydryas editha, in which geographical variation of diet is                  
              already well documented.                                                       
                   Studies of interpopulation variation of plant acceptability               
              will quantify the contribution of plant variation to the observed              
              geographical variation of insect diet.  Correlations between                   
              attack rates and acceptability may suggest hypotheses about the                
              nature and extent of plant evolutionary responses to insect                    
              attack.                                                                        
                   Within a plant population that shows variation of                         
              acceptability the investigators will estimate the correlation                  
              between acceptability and fitness in the presence and absence of               
              insects.  If there studies are successful, an experiment that                  
              simulates the evolutionary effects of insect attack by applying                
              artificial selection to plant acceptability will be attempted.
