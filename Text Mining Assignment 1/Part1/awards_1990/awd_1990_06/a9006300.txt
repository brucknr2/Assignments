Abstract    :
              This project concerns the design and analysis of parallel algorithms           
              on extended models of parallel computers.  Abstract machines that              
              accurately reflect architectural and operating system mechanisms of            
              parallel computers need to be developed, and their impact on the               
              design and the performance of parallel algorithms analyzed.  Features          
              to be modeled include hierarchical storage structures, parallel I/O            
              subsystem organizations, and synchronization mechanisms.                       
                                                                                             
              An appropriate paradigm addressing these issues is based on using              
              partitioning algorithms with coarse-grained parallelism.  This                 
              paradigm distinguishes between algorithmic and architecture related            
              overheads, is amenable to quantitative analysis, and provides a                
              framework for scaling solutions to fine-grained systems, as well as            
              across models from shared-memory to loosely-coupled, distributed-              
              memory systems.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The project involves a systematic investigation of the paradigm, by            
              appropriate modeling of parallel architectures, parallel algorithm             
              design and analysis on these extended models, and validation on actual         
              and simulated parallel machines.
