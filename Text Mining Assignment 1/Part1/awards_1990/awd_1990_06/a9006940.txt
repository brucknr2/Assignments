Abstract    :
              This proposal is concerned with ultralow temperature studies of                
              heavy electron superconductors (HFS) and sound propagation in                  
              superfluid helium-three.  In HFS they propose a number of                      
              measurements to further characterize the anisotropic                           
              superconducting states.  They will study the penetration and                   
              absorption of electromagnetic waves and search for contributions               
              of order-parameter collective modes.  They will correlate these                
              mesurements with ultrasound absorption studies on the same                     
              samples.  Using uniaxial stress as the symmetry breaking field                 
              they will search for multiple superconducting phases that can                  
              arise in an anisotropic superconductor.  These phases will be                  
              characterized by ultrasound, lower and upper critical field, and               
              thermal expansion measurements.  They will also investigate the                
              effects of impurities and disorder on the anisotropic phases.  In              
              superfluid helium-three they propose constructing various                      
              inhomogeneous states and study the propagation of zero-sound                   
              through them.
