Abstract    :
                   Pillay intends to investigate (1)  The spectrum problem for               
              uncountable theories, in particular, for uncountable                           
              unidimensional theories, (2)  some problems in "applied"                       
              stability theory, specifically, Zilber's conjecture for                        
              algebraically closed fields, the construction of new strongly                  
              minimal groups, and superstable differential fields, (3)  groups               
              definable over o-minimal structures.                                           
                   These problems all belong to a branch of the foundation of                
              mathematics known as "model theory", which treats such issues as               
              the consistency of axiom systems (the existence of models) and                 
              categoricity (the uniqueness of models).
