Abstract    :
                   The general area of this research is on quark models and                  
              hadronic and nuclear dynamics.  The specific topics for                        
              investigation are (1) proton-antiproton annihilation into two-                 
              meson channels, (2) the low energy theorem and its apparent                    
              break down in the photoproduction of neutral pions, (3) flavor                 
              symmetry properties of hadrons probed by external currents, (4)                
              chiral symmetry in nuclei, and (5) astrophysical applications                  
              of neutrino-nucleus reactions.
