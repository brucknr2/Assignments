Abstract    :
                   Wasps of the genus Trichogramma are parasites of the eggs of              
              other insects and are among the most widely used agents for                    
              biological control.  Despite their popularity as control agents,               
              the systematics of the North American species of Trichogramma is               
              rudimentary, hampering their most efficient use.                               
                   This project will provide continuing funding to determine                 
              species definitions, species diversity, geographic and host                    
              distributions, habitat associations and within-species character               
              variation of approximately 50 North American Trichogramma                      
              species.  The research will result in detailed species                         
              treatments; a key to species; a summary of morphological, host,                
              distribution, and reproductive data; and a phylogenetic                        
              classification of the genus.
