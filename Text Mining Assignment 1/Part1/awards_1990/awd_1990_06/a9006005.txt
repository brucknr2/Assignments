Abstract    :
                   This research addresses issues important to the study of                  
              theoretical and computational methods of obtaining solutions to                
              nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws when shock waves are                    
              present.  The main objective of the research is to understand                  
              nonlinear waves and their interactions in physical processes, and              
              in numerical methods that simulate these processes.  Topics                    
              include a study of the stability of wave patterns and the                      
              stability of numerical methods in systems exhibiting nonlinear                 
              resonance due to coincidence of wave speeds; a program for                     
              constructing a general theory of resonant wave interactions in                 
              inhomogeneous systems or conservation laws (including systems                  
              that arise in transonic gas dynamical flow in variable diameter                
              pipelines); and the study of gravity waves in general relativity               
              from the point of view of nonlinear waves.                                     
                   The project is in the area of applied mathematics dealing                 
              with the study of shock waves.  The results of this research                   
              impinge upon the fields of nonlinear partial differential                      
              equations, functional analysis, geometry, numerical analysis,                  
              scientific computing, and mathematical physics.
