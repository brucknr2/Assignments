Abstract    :
              Matching funds are provided for the acquisition of a                           
              scanning tunneling microscope for use in tribological                          
              studies.  The phenomenon of immediate interest is the                          
              initial stage of wear of thin film magnetic disks with                         
              metallic or oxide coatings.
