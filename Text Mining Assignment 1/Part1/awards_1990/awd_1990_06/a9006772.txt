Abstract    :
                   Population dynamics are determined by the demographic                     
              summation of individual reproductive success.  Reproductive                    
              success (that is, fitness) is measured by the representation of                
              descendants in the next generation.  Many offspring disperse;                  
              therefore, the reproductive success of an individual cannot be                 
              known without determining the survivorship and reproductive                    
              output of their dispersing offspring.  The investigator will                   
              continue a 28-year study of age, sex, social behavior,                         
              reproductive output, pattern of space-use, social organization,                
              and survivorship over the lifetime of males and females from                   
              four colonies of yellow bellied marmots.  In addition to                       
              collecting the basic demographic data necessary for continuity of              
              this longitudinal study, Dr. Armitage will be analyzing data                   
              collected over the lifetime of the research.                                   
                    Many rodent populations require control.  Control measures               
              are ineffective if those animals that are killed or removed are                
              quickly replaced by immigrants.  Because yellow-bellied marmots                
              frequently are agricultural pests, knowledge of the fate of                    
              dispersers will contribute to the preparation of effective                     
              control measures.
