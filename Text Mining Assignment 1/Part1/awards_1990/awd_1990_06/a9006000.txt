Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the research of a cultural anthropologist                  
              studying the historical background and political consequences of               
              change in the highlands of Papua New Guinea.  The project will                 
              compare two areas differing in their experience with economic                  
              development: Mount Hagen and Lake Kopiago.  The study will                     
              examine the impact on group violence of the recent introduction                
              of guns (replacing spears and bows and arrows), as well as the                 
              recent emergence of young group leaders called "hero-criminals".               
              Police records will be examined for patterns of disputes and                   
              violence, and intensive interviews will document the growing                   
              uncertainty about expectations of other people's actions.                      
                                                                                             
              This research will add a valuable example to the roster of cases               
              on the violent effects of economic development on tribal people.               
              It is important to understand the local causes of violence in                  
              order to understand the patterns of violent reaction to                        
              development occurring in the world, so that political leaders can              
              design programs to ameliorate these troubles.
