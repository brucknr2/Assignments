Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed work is a detailed experimental                  
              investigation of the transition between a particulate bed                      
              without aeration and a fully fluidized bed.  Measurements of                   
              bed expansion, gas pressure drop, and axial bulk density                       
              profiles are planned.  The results will be used to identify                    
              plastic yield limits, reversible stresses in particle                          
              assembly, the role of interaction between particles and solid                  
              bounding walls.  Different particulate materials will be used                  
              in experiments.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The results should provide an improved understanding of the                    
              fluidization mechanism, reference data for modeling, and basic                 
              correlations necessary to estimate the performance of gas-                     
              particle transport systems.
