Abstract    :
              Professor David Chandler is supported by a grant from The                      
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his                
              research on the statistical mechanical treatment of dynamics                   
              and structure in liquids.  This research will contribute                       
              significantly to our physical understanding of liquid structure                
              at the molecular level, and provide a fundamental molecular                    
              level description of chemical reactions in solution.                           
                                                                                             
              The main thrust of Chandler's research is in the area of                       
              chemical dynamics and quantum processes in liquids.                            
              Specifically, he plans to develop extensions and applications                  
              of techniques for performing time dependent quantum Monte Carlo                
              calculations on liquid systems.  He also plans to develop new                  
              treatments for electronic states in liquids and for metal                      
              insulator transitions in liquids.  The reference interaction                   
              site model (RISM) developed in Chandler's research group will                  
              be extended to the treatment of solvation dynamics, and a new                  
              dynamical functional integral approach for treating                            
              vitrification and glass transition will also be developed.
