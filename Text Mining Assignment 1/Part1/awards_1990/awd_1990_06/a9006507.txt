Abstract    :
                   Despite numerous theoretical studies on evolution in                      
              heterogeneous environments and empirical studies  of genotype-                 
              environment interactions, patterns of variation in the selective               
              environment have been largely ignored by evolutionary biologists.              
              Theoretical studies have shown that the results of natural                     
              selection in heterogeneous environments depend critically on the               
              spatial and temporal scale of heterogeneity in the selective                   
              environment.  The selective environment is define by changes rank              
              order of fitness among genotypes (genotype-environment                         
              interactions).  The investigators will examine spatial and                     
              temporal heterogeneity of selection in an oldfield population of               
              Erigeron annuus, using three replicated asexual genotypes as                   
              "photometers"  to measure environmental heterogeneity.                         
              Seedlings of the  three genotypes will be planted in a sample                  
              grid and monitored for survivorship and fecundity. Areas of                    
              positive spatial autocorrelation of relative fitness will define               
              the selective patch, and this will be compared to variation in                 
              the physical environment.  This research will result in the first              
              map of the selective landscape and will show temporal changes in               
              the selective surface during succession.
