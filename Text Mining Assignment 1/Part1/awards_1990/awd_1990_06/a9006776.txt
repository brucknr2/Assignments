Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              focus on several issues within the framework of the standard                   
              gauge theory of particle interactions.  The problem of the                     
              strange quark and gluon contents of the nucleon will be                        
              studied.  In particular, the physical origin and phenomeno-                    
              logical consequences of 'anomalies' (the quantum violation of                  
              classical conservation laws) which are related to these                        
              contents will be examined.                                                     
                   This work has wide implications for our understanding of                  
              the theory of the strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics,                 
              and for our understanding of the nucleon.
