Abstract    :
                  The focus of this research is on the semiconductor industry.               
              Two firms and a consulting institute will collaborate with the                 
              university research team to:  (1) perform field studies and                    
              participate in product design activities to obtain specifics of                
              data requirements and knowledge acquisition information, to gain               
              insights into opportunities and issues and to develop input for a              
              computer-integrated enterprise prototype; (2) address data                     
              integration and distribution design issues that are unique to                  
              computer-integrated engineering environments and incorporate expert            
              systems/artificial intelligence, facilitating the on-going                     
              improvement of the system; and (3) evaluate the effect of this                 
              system on organizational structure as it impacts the ultimate                  
              profitability of the firm through quality, cost and time to create             
              and deliver a product.                                                         
                 Research could have direct impact on structuring organizational             
              knowledge for effective design and produce advances in data                    
              integration and delivery.
