Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will continue his research in two              
              areas of spectral geometry.  The first involves isospectral three              
              dimensional manifolds with curvature assumptions but no                        
              restriction on conformal class.  In the second project he will                 
              develop a trace formula and Selberg zeta function for arbitrary                
              geometrically finite discrete groups whose fundamental regions                 
              have infinite hyperbolic volume.                                               
                   The principal investigator will extend his theories of                    
              isospectral manifolds which are not necessarily isometric.  In                 
              two dimensions, isospectral manifolds are surfaces which sound                 
              alike when struck.  In higher dimensions, examples are known of                
              hypersurfaces which sound alike but which are not isometric; that              
              is, they do not have identical shapes.
