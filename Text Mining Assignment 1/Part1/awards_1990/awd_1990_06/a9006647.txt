Abstract    :
                   The vast majority of all plants have seeds modified for                   
              dispersal, movement away from the parent plant.  The pattern of                
              seed dispersal has the potential to affect both the survival of                
              individual plants and characteristics of plant populations.                    
              Since plants are immobile once rooted, the quality of the site                 
              into which a plant is dispersed as a seed has a major effect on                
              its survival.  Patterns of seed dispersal also affect the spatial              
              arrangement of genetically related individuals.  This spatial                  
              genetic structure has important consequences for the plant                     
              population.                                                                    
                   The investigators wil document the effects of seed dispersal              
              on plant fate and population genetic structure by following the                
              movement and subsequent survival of seeds in natural populations,              
              using the dispersal of seeds of the native wildflower, Trillium                
              grandiflorum, by ants as a model system.  Seeds will be marked                 
              with a radio label that will allow them to be relocated after                  
              dispersal by ants or other animals.  The survival and growth of                
              plants resulting from dispersed and undispersed seeds will be                  
              followed for 3 years.  The genetic identity of plants will be                  
              determined using electrophoresis.  In order to document the role               
              of dispersal in the development of spatial genetic structure, the              
              genetic structure of the study population will be determined at                
              four stages of the plant life cycle:  undispersed seeds,                       
              dispersed seeds, seedlings, and adult plants.                                  
                   The results of this study will be of a value to conservation              
              biologists  involved in the preservation or restoration of                     
              plants in their natural habitats.  An understanding of the                     
              effects of seed dispersal on plant survival is critical to such                
              efforts.  This study will also explore the importance of seed                  
              dispersal by animals in the development of population genetic                  
              structure and in the maintenance of population genetic diversity,              
              two factors that may be important in the long-term conservation                
              of viable populations.
