Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a proposal for funding for a fluorometer that                          
              measures of samples over a range of wavelengths from the                       
              visible through the mid infrared.  This instrument would                       
              complement existing absorption spectrometers.  The addition                    
              of this instrument would enhance the optical property                          
              measurement facilities and ensure the complete                                 
              characterization of materials fabricated in a department                       
              that already has an excellent record for the measurement of                    
              physical and chemical properties of ceramic materials.  The                    
              instrument requested would enable the measurement of                           
              luminescence of materials out to a wavelength of 16 on a                       
              variety of sample geometries and sizes at temperatures down                    
              to 77K.  In particular, it would enhance the optical fibre                     
              fabrication program currently being developed at the New                       
              York State College of Ceramics by allowing comprehensive                       
              defect amd dopant analyses.
