Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During the past decade advances in molecular biology,                          
              particularly recombinant DNA and molecular cloning                             
              technologies, have had dramatic and wide-reaching effects                      
              on many fields of biological research.  Several members of                     
              the faculty at CSULA have been using these powerful                            
              methods to gain important new insights into biological                         
              structures and regulation of biological processes.  Active                     
              research programs exploring the regulation of neuroactive                      
              peptide production and release, the expression of actin                        
              genes during development, the regulation of membrane                           
              development during the sporulation cycle of Bacillus                           
              subtilis, the structural definition of viral protein genes                     
              in mutant Sendai viruses in order to establish the                             
              molecular basis of their biological properties, defining                       
              the molecular signals for directing the orientation of                         
              viral budding in eukaryotic cells, studies of sub-cellular                     
              organization in higher plants, mechanisms of uniparental                       
              inheritance of mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA in                            
              Chlamydomonas, and studies of mechanisms regulating the                        
              expression of phosphate starvation-induction of gene                           
              expression in higher plants all depend heavily on the                          
              availability of the fundamental infrastructure of a well-                      
              equipped recombinant DNA research facility at CSULA.  The                      
              current facility, largely funded by our currently awarded                      
              RIMI grant, located at this urban university with its                          
              large and diverse minority enrollment, is providing a                          
              center of research excellence that promotes training for                       
              minority students and will be a focus for related work at                      
              the many neighboring State University Campuses.  This                          
              application requests continued support for this multi-user                     
              research facility, particularly for expanding our capacity                     
              to carry out diverse types of tissue culture, and for the                      
              individual research programs described above.
