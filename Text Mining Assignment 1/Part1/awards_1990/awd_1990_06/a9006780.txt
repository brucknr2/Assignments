Abstract    :
              Several projects, including numerical studies in heat transfer                 
              phenomena, bifurcating flows, novel breathing cooling devices,                 
              and coupled radiative transfer and combustion in compartment                   
              fires, will be aided through the acquisition of computer                       
              graphics equipment.  The equipment, including a high-end                       
              workstation to process high resolution imagery and a laser                     
              printer for high resolution graphics, will help researchers to                 
              understand, process and make efficient use of the voluminous                   
              digital data associated with computational and experimental                    
              studies.
