Abstract    :
                   Prof. Christodoulou will pursue rigorous mathematical                     
              studies of interest to gravitational research.  A new proof of                 
              the global nonlinear stability of the vacuum (Minkowski space)                 
              will be given which avoids the use of maximal hypersurfaces.                   
              The concepts of local mass and angular momentum in general                     
              relativity will be investigated.  The structure of                             
              singularities in spherically symmetric gravitational collapse                  
              will be analyzed.  This should lead to understanding the good                  
              behavior of solutions of the spherically symmetric Einstein                    
              equations in the past of the apparent horizon.  The proof of a                 
              theorem describing the formation of black holes and                            
              singularities for the general Einstein equations will be                       
              attempted.
