Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor William G. Moulton of                        
              Florida State University in a research collaboration with                      
              Professors Nevill Clark and Alejandro Saenz of the University                  
              of Costa Rica.  The goal of their research is to study flux                    
              pinning and vortex dynamics in high Tc superconductors.  A                     
              Hall microprobe will be used to observe fluxoid motion driven                  
              by both force and thermal gradients.  Studies will be made on                  
              thin films, produced at Florida State, of pinning forces and                   
              vortex behavior as a function of magnetic field and tempera-                   
              ture.  The effect of the flux lattice and flux melting phases                  
              and the microstructure of the films on the flux lattice and                    
              pinning also will be studied.  It is hoped that further                        
              evidence of 2 to 3D transitions can be observed.                               
                                                                                             
              By providing expert personnel and facilities in a project of                   
              mutual interest that contributes to the scientific development                 
              of Costa Rica, this project fulfills the objectives of the                     
              Science in Developing Countries Program.
