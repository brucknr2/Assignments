Abstract    :
                   The effects of quantum fluctuations on nonlinear dynamical                
              processes are studied.  These include the quantum manifestation                
              of the fractal dissociation boundary of a driven spin system,                  
              the localized states of hydrogen and resonance fluorescence in                 
              a three-level atom.  The relationship between quantum and                      
              classical mechanics is investigated using semiclassical and                    
              quantum mechanics, the Husimi and generalized Husimi                           
              representation and by varying a fluctuation parameter.                         
              Finally, the mechanism underlying the classical and "quantum                   
              fractal" boundary and lifetime distributions in studied using                  
              Cantor sets in phase space.
