Abstract    :
              This project consists of three parts: asymptotic probabilities of              
              sentences about finite models, random resource allocation graphs, and          
              definability of sets of finite models.                                         
                                                                                             
              In the first part, the general type of problem is: given a class of            
              finite models and a sentence appropriate to them, estimate the                 
              probability that the sentence holds, for large models in the class.            
              Also, for randomly evolving finite models, determine the expected              
              waiting time until the sentence holds.  Various classes of models and          
              probability distributions will be investigated.                                
                                                                                             
              In the second part, a resource allocation graph is a structure that            
              models the state of a multiprogramming computer system.  As processes          
              request and release resources, the resource allocation graph evolves           
              stochastically.  The expectations of the following random variables            
              will be studied:  the waiting time until deadlock, the number of               
              unblocked processes, and the size of the first cycle when deadlock             
              occurs.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The third part is an investigation of whether certain sets of finite           
              models cannot be defined by monadic existential sentences with at most         
              one alternation in the first-order part of their prenex normal form            
              prefix.  This would have implications for nonlinear lower time bounds.
