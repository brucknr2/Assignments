Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will work on applications of the               
              wavelet transform and neural network models to density and                     
              regression estimates.  This topic treats one of the fundamental                
              problems in mathematical statistics.  It has important                         
              applications to pattern recognition, prediction, and expert                    
              systems designs.  The investigator will bring to these problems                
              knowledge from mathematical physics.  In addition, the                         
              investigator will work with undergraduate students on aspects of               
              this topic.  In particular, the undergraduates will be                         
              introduced to these topics via data analysis.
