Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research                            
              project between Dr. Robert Ettema of the University of                         
              Iowa and Dr. O. Starosolszky of the Research Center for                        
              Water Resources is to examine the mechanics of flow and                        
              sediment transport in ice-covered rivers.  The researchers                     
              will employ laboratory and field studies as well as                            
              mathematical modeling.  They intend to draw upon field                         
              studies in Hungary at four cross sections of the Danube                        
              and Tisza Rivers as a means of obtaining case-study field                      
              data for evaluating similar water-resources developments                       
              involving U.S. ice-covered rivers.  The mathematical                           
              models will directly couple flow, bedform geometry and                         
              sediment transport processes.  Results should                                  
              significantly improve our ability to use computational                         
              hydraulics as an engineering methodology and tool for                          
              effectively simulating flow through ice-covered alluvial                       
              channels.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project in fluid, particulate and hydraulic system                        
              engineering fulfills the program objective of advancing                        
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the United States and Hungary to combine complementary                         
              efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual                             
              interest and competence in the field of basic scientific                       
              research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and                            
              mutuality of benefit.
