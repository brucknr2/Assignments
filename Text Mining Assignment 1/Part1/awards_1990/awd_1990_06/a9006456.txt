Abstract    :
              This Engineering Research Equipment award will permit the purchase             
              of various pieces of video equipment to be utilized in a research              
              program focused on interfacial phenomena in multiphase flows and               
              in materials processing.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Two thrust areas are the interaction of bubbles and fluid                      
              interfaces, where experiments are to be carried out to complement              
              existing numerical modeling, and direct observations of the spin-              
              casting process where theoretical predictions are also available               
              but in conflict with indirect experimental observations.
