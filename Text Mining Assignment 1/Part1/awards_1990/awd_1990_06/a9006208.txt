Abstract    :
                   Dr. McKitrick at the University of Michigan will study                    
              evolutionary relationships within a large group of birds that                  
              includes the sandpipers, stilts, plovers, gulls, terns and auks                
              (Order Charadriiformes).  This group is of great interest from an              
              evolutionary perspective because its members, while presumably                 
              closely related, show a wide variety of adaptations for life in                
              and around water and are consequently a very diverse assemblage.               
              Many of these adaptations have involved internal as well as                    
              external anatomical changes.  This has led to spirited debate                  
              among biologists about the significance of certain anatomical                  
              similarities and differences among these birds:  do the                        
              similarities reflect close genealogical relationship or are they               
              merely independent occurrences that have evolved in response to                
              similar environmental conditions?  This proposal will address                  
              such questions using data from the hindlimb musculature and from               
              the anatomy of the vocal apparatus.  The study will yield                      
              hypotheses about genealogical relationships within the group, as               
              well as about how the internal anatomy has evolved.  The study                 
              will also result in a large body of descriptive data that will be              
              of great use in other comparative studies about evolutionary                   
              trends in vertebrate anatomy.
