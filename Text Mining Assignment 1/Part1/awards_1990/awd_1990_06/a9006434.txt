Abstract    :
              An alternative method of coping with situations in which                       
              conventional explosives cannot be used for rock blastings, is the              
              use of highly expansive cements and mortars.  This study will                  
              identify the appropriate method or methods of testing for the                  
              physical properties of expansive cements.  The testings procedure              
              selected will be used to measure the expansive stresses generated              
              by some typical expansive cements.
