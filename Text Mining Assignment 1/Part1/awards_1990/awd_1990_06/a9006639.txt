Abstract    :
              In the usual methods of muscle stimulation muscle motor                        
              units are activated from large to small, which is reverse                      
              to the order of recruitment during physiological                               
              stimulation.  The proposed work is to further explore a                        
              novel technique for electrical muscle stimulation that                         
              maintains the physiological order of recruitment.  The                         
              method relies on high frequency collision block produced                       
              by a cuff electrode.  The project is to determine the                          
              characteristics of muscle under a variety of conditions                        
              using this new method of stimulation; the intent is to                         
              improve the control of muscle contraction.  If                                 
              successful, the project may contribute a new technique to                      
              rehabilitating paralyzed individuals.
