Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research investigates localized etching phenomena which                   
              occur in metals and nonmetals.  The program explores the factors               
              that determine where etch pits initiate and how they grow.  For                
              instance, in aluminum and some other metals etch pits can exhibit              
              oxide passivation at their sidewalls; this leads to etching of                 
              deep micron-sized cavities with constant sidewall widths.  Sites               
              of pitting are correlated with surface composition profiles                    
              determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy.                       
              Important variables that are controlled through systematic                     
              processing include dislocation substructure, impurity                          
              segregation, and vacancy concentration.  The model system                      
              selected for these studies is aluminum etched in chloride                      
              solutions.  The ultimate goal is to use the information on etch                
              pit initiation gained from this research to preprogram specific                
              patterns of etch pitting on metal surfaces.
