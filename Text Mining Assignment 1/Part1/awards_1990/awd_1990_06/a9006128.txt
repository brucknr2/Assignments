Abstract    :
              A major objective of this meeting is to bring together the leaders of          
              the more traditional communications and networking community with the          
              electro-optics and device community.  These two communities have               
              little or no collaborative tradition but do have a rapidly growing             
              need for each others expertise.  This need was explicitly identified           
              in a recent official report of the National Science Foundation.  That          
              report, entitled "NSF Panel Report on the Interface Between Optical            
              Devices and Systems," which convened on May 22, 1989, explored ways            
              and means to enhance the interaction between these two groups.                 
              Briefly, the panel concluded that the split between device fabrication         
              and theoretical system researchers was too extreme and that team or            
              group efforts and projects by members of both communities must be              
              fostered and encouraged.  The panel report concludes that the NSF has          
              a crucial role to play in enhancement of the system/device interface.          
                                                                                             
              In summary, the Optical Multiple Access Networks meeting will provide          
              an excellent opportunity for optical systems and device to become more         
              familiar with each others discipline, to meet key individuals, to help         
              identify critical emerging technologies, and to provide the collective         
              personal, and professional foundation needed to encourage future group         
              and team efforts.
