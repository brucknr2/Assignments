Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is to study robust control                                        
              strategies which are uncertainty tolerant.                                     
              The objective is to develop practical civil                                    
              structural control technology for seismic                                      
              resistant applications.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The project will consist of the following                                      
              tasks: (1) study of robust feedback loop                                       
              control design in the frequency domain, (2)                                    
              study of nonlinear design issues, (3) study                                    
              of control-structure interaction such as time                                  
              delays, and (4) experimental verification of                                   
              control strategies.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The research would contribute to the                                           
              development and implementation of robust                                       
              structural control strategies for earthquake                                   
              hazard mitigation.
