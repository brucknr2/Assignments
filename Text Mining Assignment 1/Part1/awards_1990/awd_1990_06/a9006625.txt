Abstract    :
                   Glossopteris is a fossil plant group distributed widely                   
              among the southern continents.  Paleobotanists have studied the                
              remains of this plant genus in detail, but have never brought                  
              together the disparate observations of leaves, seeds, and wood                 
              anatomy.  Dr. Kathleen Pigg has located mineralized specimens                  
              wherein different parts of individual plants have been preserved               
              in association.  Careful study of these fossils may illuminate                 
              the anatomy of the Glossopteris plant as a whole.                              
                   Reconstructing the anatomy of Glossopteris species will have              
              wide impact.  In addition to clarifying the confused taxonomy and              
              classification of disassociated plant parts, this research will                
              document the nature of stem-leaf connections, and the vein                     
              systems of individual leaves.  These anatomical features are                   
              critical to our understanding of this important plant group, and               
              will offer a new window into its place in the evolution of                     
              gymnosperms and the origin of flowering plants.
