Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will conduct research concerning               
              percolation theory, the random cluster model, and their relation               
              to Ising and Potts models, mainly in two dimensions.  Results to               
              be sought concern (1) the formation of large rings of dual bonds               
              in the random cluster model, which correspond to droplets of one               
              phase immersed in another in a special construction of the Ising               
              or Potts model; (2) the curve describing the typical shape of                  
              these rings, and its relation to properties of the function                    
              giving exponential rates of decay of correlations along rays                   
              emanating in various directions from the origin; and (3)                       
              percolation in half spaces.                                                    
                   The principal investigator is working in the field of                     
              percolation theory and self avoiding random walk theory.  The                  
              problems he will study are motivated by physical considerations.               
              For example, percolation theory was motivated by the flow of a                 
              liquid through a porous material.  Self avoiding random walks                  
              are used to model chemical polymers.
