Abstract    :
              Dr. Schurr plans to study the rapid deformational Brownian                     
              motions of particular DNAs, DNA/Ligand complexes, and                          
              filamentous viruses by modern optical techniques, namely time-                 
              resolved fluorescence polarization anisotropy, transient                       
              photodichroism and dynamic light scattering.  Most of the                      
              studies are focussed on studying the effects of temperature,                   
              salt concentrations and base composition on the dynamics of DNA                
              in the presence of Small molecules that bind to DNA, e.g.,                     
              ethidium chloroquine and methylene blue.  Some specific                        
              examples of these studies are:  1) to assess the local                         
              motions of intercalated ethidium as a function of temperature                  
              and viscosity;  2) to investigate the relative populations of                  
              different kinds of dye binding sites as a function of                          
              temperature, salt concentration and base composition;  3) to                   
              determine whether the structural transition induced in DNA by                  
              chloroquine at low salt concentration is local or long-range                   
              and to study its dependence on salt concentration;  4) to                      
              construct DNAs that are oligomers of the wild-type and mutant                  
              operators, to measure their twisting and bending                               
              rigidities, and to examine the effect of saturation binding                    
              on their tertiary structure;  5) to examine the effect of                      
              crystallization solvent on the twisting and bending rigidities                 
              of DNA; and  6) to measure the dynamic bending rigidities of                   
              filamentous viruses with similar radii but different internal                  
              structures.
