Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves three related areas of research on ant                   
              systematics.  (1) Species-level revisionary work will continue on              
              the subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae, a pantropical group with more                  
              than 300 species, many of which are involved in mutualistic                    
              interactions with plants.  (2) The evolution of ant-plant                      
              mutualisms will be examined by phylogenetic and comparative                    
              biological studies of pseudomyrmecine lineages associated with                 
              domatia-bearing plants.  (3) The phylogenetic relationships among              
              the ant subfamilies will be investigated by a comprehensive                    
              survey of character variation (in all castes) and a detailed                   
              cladistic analysis.  The proposed taxonomic and phylogenetic                   
              studies of pseudomyrmecine ants will improve our understanding of              
              an important group of tropical ants, and contribute insight into               
              the origin and maintenance of ant-plant symbioses.  A well-                    
              corroborated phylogeny of the ant subfamilies will provide a                   
              valuable framework for comparative studies of ant biology.
