Abstract    :
                   Evidence to date suggests that exotic invariant continua                  
              play a determining role in many dynamical systems.  Kennedy will               
              continue investigating how these continua arise in dynamical                   
              systems and what role they play.  Part of this research involves               
              teaming up with various researchers from dynamics in the hopes                 
              that the combined expertise from dynamics and continuum topology               
              will have a better chance to solve the problems involved.
