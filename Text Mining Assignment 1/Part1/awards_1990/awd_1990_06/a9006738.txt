Abstract    :
                   The outcome of many high order processes in ecology depends               
              on the way in which the abundance and distribution of plants                   
              affects the eating rate of plants by animals.  However,                        
              mechanistic models describing the operation of the functional                  
              response of herbivores have failed to emerge apart from those                  
              developed for predators.  The P.I. offer new models describing                 
              the effects of spatial and morphological characteristics of                    
              plants on the intake rate of plant tissue by vertebrate                        
              herbivores.  Their models depart from the Type II  response                    
              represented in Holling's disc equation by assuming that searching              
              for food and processing it are complementary rather than                       
              exclusive activities.  Their hypothesize that the parameters in                
              our models should follow allometric relationships for linear and               
              surface dimensions of animals.  The P.I.'s conduct a randomized                
              complete block experiment with a factorial layout to test the                  
              predictions of our models and to describe the allometric scaling               
              that governs their behavior.  Factors in the experiment will                   
              include animal body size, as well as plant bite size and biomass.              
              The investigator will observe responses to these treatments in                 
              vertebrate herbivores ranging in mass over five orders of                      
              magnitude.  The results will serve as a foundation for future                  
              development of a comprehensive model of feeding behavior in these              
              animals.
