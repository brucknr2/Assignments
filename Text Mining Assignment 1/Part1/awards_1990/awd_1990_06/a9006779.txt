Abstract    :
                   This research will improve understanding of the dynamics of               
              tree death replacement in old-growth forests.  Specific goals are              
              to investigate the species-and size-specific growth and death                  
              rates of canopy trees, gap characteristics associated with canopy              
              tree death, vegetation development in gaps, and the dynamics of                
              dead trees.                                                                    
                   These goals will be met by resampling canopy trees and gap                
              vegetation originally sampled in old-growth forests of the                     
              southern Appalachians.                                                         
                   The combinations of data sets on growth and mortality will                
              allow turnover in the forests to be studied to a degree                        
              impossible elsewhere.  These forests are the best example in the               
              eastern United States of forests likely  to be in long-term                    
              equilibrium in terms of species composition and ecosystem                      
              properties.  They will serve as a valuable control for                         
              interpreting changes in other eastern forests; e.g., determining               
              whether human activity or changing climate is causing more or                  
              different changes than usual.  This study also will demonstrate                
              how different aspects of species life histories (e.g., canopy                  
              longevity versus gap-capturing ability) can result in their                    
              coexistence in diverse forests.  Findings from the analysis will               
              contribute directly to the knowledge base needed to predict the                
              effects of global change.
