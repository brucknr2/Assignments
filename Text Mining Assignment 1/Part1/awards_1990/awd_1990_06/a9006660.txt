Abstract    :
                   Among families of flowering plants, the grass family                      
              (Poaceae) is one of the most conspicuous elements of world                     
              vegetation, and economically the most important.  The grass                    
              family is classified taxonomically into six morphologically                    
              distinct subfamilies, among them the Pooideae, which includes the              
              majority of grasses of the world's cool temperate regions.                     
              Phylogenetic or evolutionary relationships remain obscure among                
              the 650 or so genera of the Poaceae, including the 150 or so of                
              subfamily Pooideae, in part because of the reduced and                         
              streamlined nature of grass vegetative and reproductive parts.                 
                   Dr. Jerrold Davis of Cornell University is studying the                   
              phylogenetic relationships of selected members of the Pooideae                 
              with specific attention to two of its major subgroupings, the                  
              tribe Poeae (including fescues, bluegrasses, and wheats) and the               
              tribe Aveneae (including oats).  Both morphological and molecular              
              data are being collected, the latter from intensive analyses of                
              nucleotide mutations in the chloroplast DNA of representative                  
              grass samples.  Comparisons between morphological and molecular                
              patterns of diversification are being made, and congruent                      
              patterns are being used to clarify evolutionary trends within the              
              grass family and determine pathways of migration and geographical              
              distribution.
