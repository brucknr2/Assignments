Abstract    :
              In this project ("Structure and Rearrangement of Carbocations.                 
              The Isotopic Perturbation Method") in the Organic Dynamics                     
              Program, Professor Martin Saunders of the Chemistry Department                 
              at Yale University will continue studies on the development and                
              applications of the isotopic perturbation method.  The focus of                
              this project will be the investigation of the fundamental                      
              properties of reactive carbocations.                                           
                                                                                             
              This project will be focussed on the extension of the isotopic                 
              perturbation method to study the cooperative effects of                        
              multiple deuteration which produces equilibrium isotope effects                
              that  are nonlinear functions of the number of deuterium atoms.                
              Experimental evidence will be obtained  from investigations of                 
              the angular dependence of the isotope effects in rapid                         
              processes which include rotation around single bonds that                      
              varies dihedral angles between carbocation orbitals and                        
              carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon bonds.  Ab initio quantum                    
              mechanical calculations will be performed to predict the                       
              energies and structures of carbocations and to predict                         
              equilibrium isotope effects which will be compared with the                    
              experimental results.
