Abstract    :
                   This project will study general optimization and control                  
              problems with nonsmooth data and develop effective methods for                 
              the analysis and the solution of such problems based on their                  
              approximation by problems of a simpler nature.  Using                          
              approximation methods, tools of nonconvex analysis connected with              
              the concepts of generalized differentials, normals, and conjugate              
              mappings will be developed.  Various applications of these                     
              methods will be made to sensitivity analysis, controllability,                 
              stability, optimality conditions, and other aspects of                         
              optimization and control in numerous problems.  Finite difference              
              approximations for continuous-time optimal control systems with                
              constraints will be analyzed.  Application to modeling in                      
              engineering and related areas are expected.
