Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award is for a minority postdoctoral fellowship to be                
              conducted at the University of California, Irvine.  The research               
              will identify potential mechanisms by which peripherally acting                
              agents affect brain processes involved in modulating memory                    
              storage.  This research holds great promise to advance our                     
              understanding of the way that our bodies prepare our brains to                 
              learn information that may have survival value.  This                          
              postdoctoral fellowship will allow a bright young minority                     
              student to expand his experience in neuroscience.
