Abstract    :
              The Fourth International Workshop on Plant Mitochondria                        
              continues a series of informal and interactive gatherings for                  
              researchers in the fields of plant mitochondrial genetics,                     
              biochemistry, physiology and molecular biology.  This Workshop                 
              is the only forum for a large number of researchers in the field               
              to interact.  The format requires that all attendees present                   
              either a poster and/or a short talk, thus maximizing their                     
              degree of participation.  The specific objectives of the                       
              Workshop are to provide an informal atmosphere for the exchange                
              of ideas and current data, to facilitate and encourage the                     
              establishment and continuation of existing scientific                          
              collaborations, and to hold concurrent workshops on specialized                
              topics and thus to identify critical research objectives in the                
              understanding of mitochondrial function and biogenesis.  The                   
              Workshop will be at Cornell University, where there is active                  
              research in plant organelle molecular biology, biochemistry and                
              transformation.  Several significant advances have occurred                    
              since the last Workshop, including the discovery of RNA editing                
              in plant mitochondria, mitochondrial transformation and the                    
              complete sequence analysis of a plant mitochondrial genome.                    
              The upcoming Workshop promises to be the most scientifically                   
              stimulating to date, and has already attracted widespread                      
              interest including inquiries or accepted invitations from nearly               
              100 scientists from 15 countries.
