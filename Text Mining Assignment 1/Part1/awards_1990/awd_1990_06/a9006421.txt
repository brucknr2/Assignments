Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two projects, one to analyze heat transfer from a surface with                 
                                                                                             
              a low superheat via a spray cooling method, and the second to                  
              measure soot particle size and dynamics in diffusion flames,                   
              will be strengthened by the addition of a Phase Doppler                        
              Particle Analyzer (PD PA).  The PDPA is capable of measuring                   
              simultaneously the particle size, one velocity component,                      
              number density, particle volume flux and flow rate in a liquid                 
                                                                                             
              spray or in a diffusion flame.  This equipment should improve                  
              the quantitative understanding of heat transfer, and                           
              specifically critical heat flux, in spray cooling, and of soot                 
                                                                                             
              formation and diffusion flame structures.
