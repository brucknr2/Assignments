Abstract    :
              This research equipment award is made to partially support the                 
              purchase of a laser extensometer which will be used to examine                 
              mixed-mode crack initiation and propagation along bimaterial                   
              interfaces.  Prior work has established that the nature of the                 
              material interfaces dramatically changes the toughness of bond.
