Abstract    :
              This is a proposal on the acquisition of a material testing system             
              for the Advanced Civil Engineering Materials Research Laboratory               
              at the University of Michigan.  The Testing System for Advanced                
              Materials consists of a MTS 55 KIP load frame, a 22 KIP                        
              actuator,load cells service manifold, servovalve, Micro Console,               
              strain and load Controller, stroke controller, Micro Profiler with             
              RS232 interface, 1.5 GPM hydraulic power supply, alignment fixture,            
              automated control and data acquisition system hardware and software            
              hydraulically operated side entry grips, collet grips, axial                   
              extensometer and clip gage. The system is configured for testing               
              of brittle, high modulus samples, etc, in quasi-static monotonic               
              to cyclic fatigue loads.
