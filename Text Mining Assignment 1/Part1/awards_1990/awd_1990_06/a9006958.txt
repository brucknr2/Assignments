Abstract    :
              This program, to be carried out by one of the world's leading                  
              theoretical astrophysicists, seeks to break new ground in the study            
              of large-scale cosmic structure, and of the infall of matter onto              
              compact objects.  It will do this by implementing modern grid-based            
              hydrocodes, to be adapted from successful aerodynamic codes.                   
              Previous work in cosmological modeling has been based primarily on             
              sophisticated N-body codes, which, while adequate for studying dark            
              matter, are less well adapted to observable gaseous matter.  True              
              hydrodynamic computational methods will be developed, which can                
              treat shocks and radiative processes, and permit the direct                    
              calculation of X-ray emission, fluctuations in the cosmic                      
              background radiation, and other phenomena not accessible from the              
              N-body approach.
