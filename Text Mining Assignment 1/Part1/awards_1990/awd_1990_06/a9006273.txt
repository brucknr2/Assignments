Abstract    :
                   There are several broad goals of the proposed research.  The              
              first is to produce a molecular phylogeny of 18 superfamilies of               
              the more advanced groups of moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera)                
              and of various groups (families and subfamilies) within two of                 
              the most conspicuous and widely studied superfamilies, true                    
              butterflies and noctuoid moths.  Second, by assessing the nature               
              and rate of evolution of mitochondrial and nuclear genes the                   
              research will contribute to the fields of molecular biology and                
              evolution.  This research is of fundamental importance not only                
              because it will contribute new insights into the systematics of                
              Lepidoptera, but because it will provide a framework for                       
              inferences about evolution, biogeography, and speciation.                      
                   To resolve phylogenetic relationships at higher taxonomic                 
              levels in Lepidoptera, a molecular viewpoint is required because               
              of the paucity of morphological structures that define groups.                 
              For example, butterflies have undergone a tremendous amount of                 
              adaptive radiation but exhibit few unique biological                           
              characteristics that link them with any particular moth group.                 
              At least six moth groups have been proposed to be butterfly                    
              ancestors.  A molecular phylogeny should resolve these unanswered              
              questions about the origin of butterflies.
