Abstract    :
              This research is on compiled simulation of IC designs.  Topics                 
              explored are: (1) purely compiled methods for unit-delay and multi-            
              delay simulation, (2) event-driven compiled simulation for multi-              
              delay and nominal-delay simulation, and (3) hierarchal incremental             
              compilation to reduce recompilation time.  Existing techniques for             
              purely compiled unit-delay simulation are being and extended to                
              handle cyclic circuits.  These techniques are also being used as               
              a basis for creating a purely compiled multi-delay simulator.                  
              Techniques for zero-delay, event-driven, compiles simulation are               
              being adapted to multi-delay and nominal-delay simulation.                     
              Finally, techniques for hierarchical compiled simulation are being             
              extended to handle cyclic circuits, and are being adapted to                   
              perform compile-time partitioning of sub-circuits.
