Abstract    :
                   Two separate methods for the study of dynamical properties                
              of fluid-flows will develop in the context of specific problems.               
              In part I, the quasi-periodic and chaotic motions of vortex                    
              systems with a large number of particles  and unrestricted                     
              vorticity will be considered.  These vortex systems include the                
              point-vortex model, and desingularized versions such as the                    
              vortex blob model.  A combinatorial approach that for the first                
              time will enable the study of dynamical problems that are                      
              relevant  vortex methods and particle methods in general to be                 
              used.  This approach will overcome the severe restriction on the               
              size of perturbations in Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory, which                 
              has hitherto limited its applications to problems with few                     
              degrees of freedom.                                                            
                   In part II, periodic and chaotic motions of stokes spheres                
              in sedimentation theory will be studied.  Near-equilibrium                     
              dynamics of identical sedimenting particles will emphasized.                   
              Equivariant version of the Melnikov theory will be attempted.
