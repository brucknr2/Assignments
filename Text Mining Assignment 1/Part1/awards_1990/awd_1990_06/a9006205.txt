Abstract    :
                   Partial support is provided for the North East Set Theory                 
              Seminar.  NESTS was formed in the fall of 1981.  It meets monthly              
              during the academic year at Smith College. Four one-hour talks                 
              are scheduled each meeting.  The seminar is organized by set                   
              theorists on faculties throughout the region. While the focus of               
              the seminar is set theory, lectures have been presented related                
              to set theory in other fields, both in and outside of                          
              mathematical logic.  Numerous graduate students and occasional                 
              foreign visitors to one of the region's institutions also                      
              participate.
