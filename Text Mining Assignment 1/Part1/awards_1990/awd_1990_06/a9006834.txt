Abstract    :
                   This study will expand and refine a molecular method for                  
              identification of ectomycorrhizal fungi.  The method is based on               
              amplification of DNA with the polymerase chain reaction coupled                
              with oligonucleotide hybridization assays of the resulting                     
              productd.  The sensitivity of the method enables fungal symbionts              
              from individual mycorrhizal rootlets to be identified to a                     
              variety of taxonomic levels (e.g., order to strain) and tree                   
              hosts to be identified simultaneously.  This method will be used               
              to examine several ecologically significant host-symbiont                      
              interactions; mycorrhizal parasitism, fungal symbiont sharing and              
              host specificity and competitive interactions among selected                   
              species.  These studies will provide the necessary foundation for              
              later testing of theories of fungal succession and mycorrhizal                 
              community structure, phenomena that are highly significant in                  
              virtually all terrestrial habitats.
