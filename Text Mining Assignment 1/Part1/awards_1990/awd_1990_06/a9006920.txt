Abstract    :
              This grant supports Organization of the topical meeting on Integrated          
              Optics, Monterey, CA, July 30 - Aug. 1, 1990.  This topical meeting            
              will highlight the area of Optoelectronic Integrated Circuits (OEICs),         
              which are circuits that monolithically integrate optical and                   
              electronic components on a single semiconductor chip.  OEICs represent         
              a device technology which has the potential to make a major impact in          
              future telecommunications and computing systems requirements.  There           
              are major challenges in materials growth and device fabrication that           
              are presented by the integration of very different devices on a single         
              chip.  The Japanese have made significant advances in this technology,         
              particulary because of the strengths of their leading industrial firms         
              active in optoelectronics, whereas in the United States the efforts            
              have been very fragmented.  The goal of this topical meeting is to             
              bring together researchers and students working on OEICs, from                 
              industry, government labs, and academia, to discuss the latest                 
              developments in the field, to assess the potential of the technology           
              and the problems related to fabrication, and to stimulate the creation         
              of collaborative efforts.  The meeting will focus on materials and             
              fabrication issues as well as systems applications.
