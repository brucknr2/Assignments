Abstract    :
                   In mammals generally, and in meadow voles in particular,                  
              males tend to move greater distances than females between their                
              place of birth and the location of their initial breeding                      
              attempt.  Considerable controversy exists over the cause or                    
              causes of this pattern of movement known as male-biased natal                  
              dispersal.  One explanation, the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis,              
              states that the sexes move different distances to avoid mating                 
              with close relatives because of the potentially deleterious                    
              effects of inbreeding.  A second possibility, the competition-                 
              for-mates hypothesis, suggests that competition among males for                
              mates causes male-biased dispersal.                                            
                   This study proposes to experimentally examine these 2                     
              hypotheses.  Laboratory-reared meadow voles will be released into              
              small, uniform patches of grassland habitat, and their dispersal               
              from these patches will be monitored.  Sibling groups will be                  
              released into some plots and non-sibling groups into other plots.              
              These groups will consist of either 3 males and 1 female or 3                  
              females and 1 male.  Greater dispersal from patches containing                 
              siblings will support inbreeding avoidance as a cause of                       
              dispersal patterns in mammals, whereas dispersal from patches                  
              with male-biased sex ratios will suggest competition for mates is              
              important.  This proposed study is one of the first to test                    
              experimentally these 2 hypotheses.  It should provide valuable                 
              information concerning why male mammals tend to disperse greater               
              distance than females.
