Abstract    :
              A high power,auto-scanning, ring dye laser system is proposed                  
              for accurate sizing of micro-particles (1 to 50 microns) by                    
              means of wavelength dependent resonance spectra.  Measurements                 
              are performed on a single particle levitated in an electrical                  
              field.  The particle is illuminated.  Accuracy on the order of                 
              1 Angstrom is expected.  Besides the particle size, one can                    
              determine forces on particles in temperature and density                       
              gradients, evaporation and condensation rates, nucleation                      
              rates, and collection efficiencies.                                            
                                                                                             
              Measurement of micro-particle properties is important to many                  
              research area, such as manufacturing (superconductors,                         
              semiconductors, chemicals), weather (fog, mist, ozone, nuclear                 
              winter) and pollution control (smog, acid rain, radon).
