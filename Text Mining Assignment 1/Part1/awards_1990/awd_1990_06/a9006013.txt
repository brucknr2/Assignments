Abstract    :
              The Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.                
              David J. Hart of the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State                     
              University.  Dr. Hart is a pioneer in the development of                       
              intermolecular free radical addition reactions for use in                      
              organic synthesis.                                                             
                                                                                             
              In the current project, stannyl ethers of benzopinacols will be                
              investigated as sources of tin radicals which, in turn, will                   
              mediate conjugate and azomethine addition reactions.  The study                
              of beta-stannylboranes as reagents for coupling alkyl halides,                 
              alkyl selenides, nitroalkanes and xanthates to electron                        
              deficient alkenes will also be undertaken.  Another objective                  
              of the research will be to investigate the stereochemical                      
              course of the intermolecular reactions of alpha-carboalkoxy,                   
              alpha-alkoxy and alpha-acylamino radicals.  Substrates for the                 
              reactions of these radicals will include trialkyltin hydrides,                 
              allylstannanes and electron deficient alkenes.  The results of                 
              the studies will be compared to the related alkylations of                     
              ester enolates and carbonyl addition reactions.
