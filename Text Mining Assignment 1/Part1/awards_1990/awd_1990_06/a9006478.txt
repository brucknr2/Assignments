Abstract    :
                   This RUI project is aimed at better understanding the                     
              composition, dynamics, and energetics of the upper atmosphere                  
              through measurements and analysis of the extremely faint                       
              nighttime airglow emissions. Four wavelengths of light arising                 
              from different upper atmospheric processes are chosen to obtain                
              information from four different heights in the upper atmosphere.               
              The institution has an eight channel zenith photometer (for the                
              four wavelengths and background reference), and an intensified                 
              all-sky camera suitable for imaging the airglow in each of four                
              selected wavelengths. Special emphasis will be given to                        
              collaborative projects in the CEDAR program to give the                        
              undergraduate students involved a realistic research experience                
              and exposure to a broad range of scientists and scientific                     
              activity. In addition, improvement of a local observing site will              
              make possible regular observational programs by undergraduates.
