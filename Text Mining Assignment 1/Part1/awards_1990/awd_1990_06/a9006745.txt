Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project provides resources to procure equipment to                        
              enhance research in the active control of vibrations and                       
              normal mode localization.  Specifically, the research                          
              entails (1) understanding the phenomenon of mode                               
              localization in both periodic and non periodic structures,                     
              (2) active control of structural vibrations based on mode                      
              localization, and (3) the experimental validation of a                         
              recently developed frequency domain design.  The equipment                     
              will be used to instrument two experimental facilities                         
              associated with this research.  One facility is a long                         
              compliant truss structure dedicated to normal mode                             
              localization studies in periodic structures, and the other                     
              is a simply supported thin flexible beam for localization                      
              studies in non periodic structures.  The equipment                             
              comprises a portable digital storage oscilloscope,                             
              brushless DC torque motors, power supplies and amplifiers                      
              for the torque motors, a non contacting displacement                           
              measuring system, and modal analysis equipment.
