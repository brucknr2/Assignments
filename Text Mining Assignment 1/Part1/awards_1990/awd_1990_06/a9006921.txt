Abstract    :
              This project provides continuing support for an experimental and               
              theoretical investigation designed to study various nonlinear effects          
              that can be found in plasmas and other media.  Particular emphasis             
              will be placed on soliton excitation and propagation in laboratory             
              plasmas and the self-similar behavior of a dense plasma as it expands          
              into an underdense plasma.  Possible applications of plasmas in the            
              area of plasma deposition of insulation coatings on metal surfaces and         
              plasma burning of metals and of solitons in the area of communication          
              will be examined.
