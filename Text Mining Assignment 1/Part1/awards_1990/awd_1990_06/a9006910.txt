Abstract    :
              The dynamic analysis of large                                                  
              complex structures either by direct                                            
              integration or by modal                                                        
              superposition is often prohibitive                                             
              due to cost.  Recently mixed                                                   
              integration and modal synthesis                                                
              techniques have been proposed to                                               
              more efficiently perform the                                                   
              dynamics analysis and to reduce the                                            
              computational cost.  These                                                     
              developments are at an early stage                                             
              and substantial work still to be                                               
              done, most notably in the                                                      
              implementation of various                                                      
              theoretical schemes to exploit the                                             
              vector and parallel processing

              systems.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This research project deals with                                               
              the implementation of finite                                                   
              element mesh partitioning, the use                                             
              of independent operations in each                                              
              partition, and the determination of                                            
              the response of the complete

              operations.  Only direct                                                       
              integration will be employed, since                                            
              these are more readily applicable                                              
              to nonlinear problems.  A Newton-

              will be study in detail and                                                    
              implemented on vector and parallel
