Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award describes an investigation into dye             
              laser and diode laser amplifiers for ultrashort pulses such as those           
              emitted from mode-locked dye lasers and gain switched diode lasers.            
              The goal in this end, this start-up program will be governed by                
              careful experiments and detailed theoretical modelling.  Of particular         
              interest will be issues of maximizing total gain and efficiency,               
              polarization dependences, gain switching dynamics in media with mixed          
              line broadening, and very high repetition rate amplification.  From a          
              practical standpoint the study of dye lasers and diode lasers has              
              impact on applications in photonics and ultrafast nonlinear optics.
