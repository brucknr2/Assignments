Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigator has generated four monoclonal antibodies that                 
              bind to basement membranes in peripheral nerve and cardiac and                 
              skeletal muscle, but do not recognize any epitopes in the central              
              nervous system.  These antibodies interfere with neurite growth                
              in vitro.  The location of these determinants and their                        
              functional activity suggest that these antibodies recognize                    
              constituents important for allowing successful axonal                          
              regeneration in the peripheral nervous system.  The PC1C5 antigen              
              is of particular interest since this antibody does not bind to                 
              the Schwann cell basement membrane in sections of sciatic nerves               
              from homozygous dystrophic mice (dy/dy); all other antibodies                  
              tested (34 in total) do stain Schwann cell basement membranes in               
              dy/dy mice.  The objectives of the research are to: 1) test the                
              PC1C5 antigen for its ability to promote neurite outgrowth; 2)                 
              obtain partial amino acid sequence for this antigen and look for               
              homology to other previously characterized proteins; 3) screen                 
              cDNA expression libraries with the four antibodies or with                     
              synthetic oligonucleotide probes based on the sequences obtained               
              in objective 2; 4) compare the molecular differences between                   
              PC1C5 antigens synthesized by Schwann cells and muscle cells; 5)               
              screen libraries from various normal and dy/dy tissues with                    
              probes obtained from expression libraries in objective 3; and 6)               
              generate Schwann cell lines from normal and dy/dy mice in an                   
              attempt to provide an in vitro model for the dystrophic mutation.
