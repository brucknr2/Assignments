Abstract    :
                   With this award the principal investigator will continue his              
              numerical analysis of scalar hyperbolic equations in one space                 
              dimension, in order to derive improved error bounds and to extend              
              his techniques to systems of such equations in higher space                    
              dimensions.  In particular, he will employ Besov space                         
              approximation theory to develop an improved regularity theory for              
              scalar conservation laws that is applicable to moving mesh                     
              numerical methods.  He will also attempt to extend moving mesh                 
              finite element methods to systems of equations by providing a                  
              theoretical justification for some practical moving mesh                       
              algorithms in current use.  There are many methods available                   
              today for the numerical solution of a single partial differential              
              equation in one space variable, but only a precious few of these               
              methods can be used to solve systems of such equations in more                 
              than one space variable.  One reason for this is that many                     
              methods lack a solid theoretical foundation.  With this award the              
              principal investigator will continue developing theoretical                    
              justifications for certain numerical schemes in the hope that                  
              better schemes for higher-dimensional systems can be found.
