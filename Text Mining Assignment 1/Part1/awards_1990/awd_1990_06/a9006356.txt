Abstract    :
                   The genus Mimosa is a diverse group of tropical and sub-                  
              tropical plants.  Dr. Rupert Barneby has finished the first                    
              complete systematic monograph on the genus since 1875.  The New                
              York Botanical Garden proposes to publish this monograph in its                
              Memoir Series.  Dr. Barneby's monograph will bring together                    
              several generations' knowledge of this diverse tropical plant                  
              group.  Much of Barneby's research has been supported by National              
              Science Foundation.                                                            
                   The proposed publication will be used world-wide as the                   
              authoritative treatment of an important plant genus.  Ecologists,              
              horticulturists, systematic botanists, and investigators in                    
              diverse other fields will benefit from this monograph.                         
              Publication in the Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden                    
              Memoirs will ensure a wide readership, and will catalyze further               
              research.
