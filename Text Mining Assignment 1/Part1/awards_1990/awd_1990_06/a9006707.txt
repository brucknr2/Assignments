Abstract    :
              The grant is for a high resolution                                             
              contact mask aligner for use in                                                
              fabricating binary phase diffractive                                           
              optical elements.  the instrument                                              
              will greatly expand the on-going                                               
              research efforts to: 1) improve                                                
              basic knowledge of binary phase                                                
              grating performance, 2) apply them                                             
              in optical interconnect systems, and                                           
              3) design and test diffractive                                                 
              elements for use in magneto-optic                                              
              data storage head assemblies.  The                                             
              requested mask aligner will extend                                             
              mask alignment resolution capability                                           
              to less than 0.4 micrometers, and is                                           
              necessary for making the complex                                               
              elements needed for the above                                                  
              applications.  Successful                                                      
              demonstration of binary phase micro-                                           
              optical components will have a major                                           
              impact on the performance and                                                  
              realization of these systems.  In                                              
              addition to supporting these                                                   
              specific research projects, the                                                
              equipment will be used to train                                                
              students to fabricate binary phase                                             
              gratings.  This would satisfy a                                                
              growing educational need expressed
