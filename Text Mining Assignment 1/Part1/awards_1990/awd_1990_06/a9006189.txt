Abstract    :
              Two-phase disordered media are most frequently encountered in                  
              modern technological applications of the physical and chemical                 
                                                                                             
              sciences.  A common example of such media is heterogeneous                     
              mixtures consisting of a fluid phase dispersed in a solid                      
              porous medium.  The mission of the proposed research is to                     
              study thermal instability phenomena associated with buoyancy-                  
              driven convection in two classes of fully-saturated systems:                   
              (i) porous media saturated with pure fluids, and (ii) porous                   
              media saturated with binary fluids.  We propose a rigorous                     
              analytical and experimental program to investigate pattern                     
              formation during natural convection in large aspect ratio                      
              enclosures filled with porous media.  Our primary objectives                   
              are:  (1) the delineation of the various stability domains for                 
                                                                                             
              the convective flows and an exploration of the convective                      
              states after the onset of secondary instabilities, (2) the                     
              development of novel experimental techniques, including non-                   
              invasive magnetic resonance imaging, for high precision                        
              measurements and determining the flow patterns in porous                       
              media, and (3) the validation of macroscopic governing                         
              equations for natural convection in porous media.
