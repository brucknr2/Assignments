Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Etching of GaAs and other compound semiconductors is                           
              performed with wet chemical techniques.  Wet chemical etching                  
              present several limitations, and therefore the P.I.'s wish                     
              to acquire a reactive ion etching (RIE) system.  RIE                           
              provides highly anisotropic etching due to kinetically                         
              assisted chemical processes.  This anisotropic etching will                    
              allow definition of smaller geometries than are currently                      
              possible with wet chemical etching capabilities due to a                       
              reduction in undercutting of masking patterns.  With proper                    
              conditions, lateral etch rates close to zero can be                            
              obtained with RIE.  This is particularly important for                         
              processing GaAs because unlike silicon, GaAs has no liquid                     
              etchants which will result in little or no undercutting of                     
              the masking pattern.  Another advantage of RIE is the                          
              ability to selectively etch layers.  This is due to the                        
              high selectivity of the etchants used.  Howevern even when                     
              this etchant selectivity is not possible, one can still                        
              selectively remove layers with RIE due to the easy                             
              incorporation of end point detection.  End point detection                     
              is the monitoring by spectrometric methods of one or more                      
              of the reactants or effluent to determine when a layer has                     
              been removed.
