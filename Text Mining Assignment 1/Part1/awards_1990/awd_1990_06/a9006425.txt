Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study will examine the potential that an array of molecules               
              with inducing properties involved in bacterial infection of plants             
              exists, and seeks to determine the chemistry, specificity, and                 
              roles of these molecules in plant-bacterial interactions.  The                 
              focus will be identification of signal compounds, the physiological            
              roles of inducers in the plant that produces them, and to a limited            
              extent, the receptors for these inducers.  It is expected that such            
              studies at detailed chemical and biological levels will lead to a              
              fuller understanding of events connected with establishment of, or             
              resistance to, bacterial infections in a variety of plants, and be             
              of value in broadening the spectrum of plants that can be                      
              transformed by bacteria such as those in the genus Agrobacterium.              
                                                                                             
              How plants, and the bacteria able to infect them, communicate with             
              each other at the molecular level to determine susceptibility or               
              resistance to infection is a prime focus of this study.  A fuller              
              understanding of these events may lead to the ability to transform             
              plant systems that are now recalcitrant to such genetic change.
