Abstract    :
              The objective in this research project is to investigate, (a) the              
              fundamental dynamics of the atmosphere as they relate to the                   
              production and maintenance of large-scale variability on time                  
              scales of several weeks to a season, (b) low frequency                         
              variability using daily rainfall and rawinsondes observations,                 
              and ship reports of surface wind vectors, and (c) the                          
              predictability of a coupled ocean-atmosphere model and its                     
              sensitivity to some of the simplifications and physical                        
              specifications made in developing it.                                          
                                                                                             
              This is an important project since it will help to provide a                   
              basis for future development of a model that simulates both                    
              mid-latitude and tropical coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions.
