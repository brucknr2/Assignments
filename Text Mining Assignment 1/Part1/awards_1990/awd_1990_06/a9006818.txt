Abstract    :
              This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will aid the principal               
              investigators work in millimeter wave (MMW) research.  This work is            
              supported by NSF in two major areas:  MMW device and circuit analysis          
              and design, and MMW remote sensing of geophysical media.  In the               
              remote sensing area, the major objective is the development of basic           
              information of the MMW propagation and scattering in random and                
              inhomogeneous media including snow, vegetation, and ground.                    
              Experimental studies have been conducted using the truck mounted MMW           
              radars.  Based on experimental data, theoretical models for snow,              
              vegetation, and trees have been developed.  However, to understand the         
              fundamental process of MMW interaction with random media, controlled           
              experiments need to be conducted, but efforts have been limited by a           
              lack of suitable MMW system.  In their study of MMW devices and                
              circuits, the principal investigators have developed a number of               
              computer codes which perform a very accurate analysis of a wide                
              variety of planar circuit elements.  These programs will be                    
              incorporated into a user friendly CAD package.  In addition, MMW               
              circuits will be fabricated and tested in order to check our                   
              analytical models.  The proposed MMW measurement and design system             
              should enhance the ability to conduct experiments and develop new              
              theoretical models.
