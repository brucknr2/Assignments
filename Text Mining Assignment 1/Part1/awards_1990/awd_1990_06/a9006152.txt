Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its receptor triggers a            
              series of cellular events that culminate in cell division.                     
              Phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at various sites has been observed         
              after exposure of cultured cells to EGF and other growth factors.  The         
              major site of phosphorylation of the EGF receptor is threonine 669             
              Thr669).  Recently, a novel growth factor-stimulated threonine-protein         
              kinase, responsible for the phosphorylation of Thr669 has been purified        
              in Dr. Roger J. Davis' laboratory.  The research plan proposes the             
              large-scale purification of "T669 protein kinase," the isolation and           
              cloning of its gene, and the development of antibodies against it, in          
              order to investigate the mechanism of activation of the novel kinase by        
              growth factors and its possible role in the transduction of mitogenic          
              signals.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              We will generate polyclonal antibodies to the kinase by injecting              
              purified enzyme into rabbits or chickens, and monoclonal antibodies by         
              injecting mice.  The antibodies will be used together with molecular           
              biology techniques in assays designed to investigate the mechanism by          
              which growth factors activate "T669 protein kinase" in signal                  
              transduction for mitogens.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The isolation of characterization of this novel growth factor-                 
              stimulated kinase could be very important for the elucidation of signal        
              transduction mechanisms for growth factors.  The regulation of kinases         
              activities has been realized to be a key process in growth control.
