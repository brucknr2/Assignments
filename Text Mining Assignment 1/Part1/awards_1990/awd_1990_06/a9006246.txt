Abstract    :
                   This grant will support the work of Notre Dame University                 
              Professor Ani Aprahamian, who will investigate the energy and                  
              lifetimes of levels in deformed nuclei produced in the fission                 
              of 235U Her analysis will center on the possible applicability                 
              of supersymmetry concepts in the description of multi-phonon                   
              vibrational modes in the neutron-rich nuclei being studied.                    
              The research will make use of the Notre Dame tandem                            
              accelerator, the ATLAS linear accelerator at Argonne National                  
              Laboratory, and the research reactor at Brookhaven National                    
              Laboratory.
