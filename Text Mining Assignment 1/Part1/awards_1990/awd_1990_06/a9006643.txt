Abstract    :
                   The black pineleaf scale insect (Nuculaspis californica                   
              Coleman) is a parasite of western yellow pine (Pinus ponderosa                 
              Lawson.  The insects are shortlived relative to their host and                 
              largely sedentary, and their populations are subdivided and                    
              genetically differentiated over extraordinarily short distances                
              in association with both individual host trees, and different                  
              branches within a single pine (Alstad and Corbin, in press).                   
              Three different kinds of evidence resulting from recent research               
              (Alstad and Edmunds 1989, Alstad and Corbin in press, and Alstad               
              unpublished) compromise our earlier view (Edmunds and Alstad                   
              1978, 1981; Alstad and Edmunds 1983a, 1983b) that scale                        
              population structure reflects adaptation of the scale demes to                 
              intrinsic, genotypic characteristics of individual host trees.                 
              The proposed research will test a new hypothesis about the                     
              mechanistic causes of local differentiation in black pineleaf                  
              scale insects infesting ponderosa pine: that scale adaptation                  
              results from selection related to extrinsic phenotypic traits                  
              which (a) are the product of interactions between the pine                     
              genotype and its environment, and (b) vary both within and                     
              between trees.  These opposing hypotheses represent major themes               
              in the literature of plant/herbivore interactions; they are of                 
              basic interest to evolutionary ecologists and have clear and                   
              important implications for forest management.
