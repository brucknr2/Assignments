Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Committee on Hearing, Bioacoustics & Biomechanics (CHABA)  is              
              a standing committee of the National Research Council of the                   
              National Academy of Sciences, which is supported by                            
              contributions from several federal agencies.  It provides                      
              analysis and advice to those sponsoring agencies, on issues                    
              involving the audition and speech, including questions of                      
              physiological and physical acoustics, neurophysiology,                         
              psychophysics, perception, engineering and equipment, hearing                  
              aids, speech comprehension, and environmental effects on                       
              hearing.  The committee of twelve members helps select and                     
              define activities of several working groups dealing with                       
              specific topics of concern to the sponsors.  Results of this                   
              work are published in reports available to scientists, the                     
              public, and to industry, and have impact on many areas of                      
              auditory science.
