Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                       A Molecular Phylogeny of the Dinoflagellates                          
                                                                                             
                  Dinoflagellates are unicellular photosynthetic eukaryotes                 
              that have unique features, including nuclear organization and                  
              chemistry,  that separate them from any other eukaryotic group.                
              This Postdoctoral Fellowship project uses standard molecular                   
              biology techniques to determine and compare sequences of small                 
              subunit ribosomal RNAs from a selected assemblage of                           
              dinoflagellates  to place them individually within their group,                
              and as a group among all eukaryotes.
