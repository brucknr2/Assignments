Abstract    :
              This project will provide support to the University of Maryland,               
              Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (UM-CEES) for                   
              renovation of docking and shore-based ship support facilities at               
              the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory in Solomons, MD in                        
              preparation for the transfer of operations of the research vessel              
              RIDGELY WARFIELD from the Johns Hopkins University, Chesapeake                 
              Bay Institute to UM-CEES.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The Johns Hopkins University has announced the closing of its                  
              Chesapeake Bay Institute in December 1991.  The R/V RIDGELY                    
              WARFIELD, a 106 foot shallow draft catamaran, has been operated                
              by the Chesapeake Bay Institute since it was built with National               
              Science Foundation funds in 1967.  The relocation of the R/V                   
              RIDGELY WARFIELD at the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory,                      
              Solomons Island, MD will provide a new, mid-Bay, central site on               
              the western shore from which to launch scientific investigations.              
                                                                                             
              CEES, the environmental sciences research arm of the University                
              of Maryland System, is a multi-laboratory institution with                     
              internationally recognized expertise in oceanography and                       
              estuarine ecology.  CEES and other institutions of the University              
              of Maryland System have been major users of the RIDGELY WARFIELD.              
                                                                                             
              The director of the project is Dr. Douglas G. Capone, Professor,               
              Chesapeake Biological Laboratory.  Oversight of ship operations                
              will be the cooperative responsibility of a newly formed                       
              Chesapeake Region Oceanographic Consortium composed of the                     
              University of Maryland Center for Environmental and Estuarine
