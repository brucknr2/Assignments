Abstract    :
                   This research will contribute to the theory of insect-plant               
              interactions by examining patterns of insect attack in host plant              
              hybrid zones.  Communities of gall-forming wasps and leaf-mining               
              moths will be examined in 15 oak hybrid zones in Mexico and the                
              Southwestern United States.  Densities of insects on hybrid trees              
              will be compared to those on non-hybrid trees.  The research will              
              elucidate factors that influence insect attack in plant hybrid                 
              zones.  Factors to be examined include:  geographic structure of               
              hybrid zones, taxonomic relationships between parental oak                     
              species, and morphological relationships between parental oak                  
              species.  Mechanistic hypotheses will be formulated that explain               
              differences in insect attack between hybrid and non-hybrid                     
              plants.  Important insights will be gained into how insect faunas              
              accrue on host plants.  These ideas will contribute to                         
              understanding whether hybrid zones act as a sink for herbivores,               
              an important issue in plant-herbivore interaction theory.  From                
              an applied perspective, results of the research will bear                      
              directly on key questions regarding the response of herbivorous                
              insects to genetically altered crop plants and hybrid zones which              
              may be near agricultural areas.
