Abstract    :
                   The Inter-Congress Committee on Tephrochronology of the                   
              International Quaternary Association will hold a field conference              
              and workshop in Wyoming in June, 1990.  This is to promote                     
              international communication, determine current status of                       
              worldwide studies, assess the impact of new developments in                    
              related fields, and promote dialogue on the role of tephra                     
              (volcanic extrusions) in solving fundamental Quaternary                        
              stratigraphic problems.  This award is to defray expenses for a                
              symposium on the relationship of these dating mechanisms to                    
              questions of hominid fossils in East Africa.  Some of the most                 
              exciting finds relating to human origins have come from East                   
              Africa and tephrostratigraphic correlations have been among the                
              most important mechanisms to fix firmly the dates of various                   
              early hominid fossils.  All the participants in the symposium                  
              have made, or are making, substantial contributions to the                     
              advancement of paleoanthropological knowledge.
