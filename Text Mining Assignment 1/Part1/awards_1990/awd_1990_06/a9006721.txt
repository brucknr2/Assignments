Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the                 
              Chemistry Division continues support to Dr. Mary                               
              Rakowski-DuBois of the Chemistry Department, University of                     
              Colorado at Boulder, for studies of carbon-carbon coupling                     
              reactions and synthesis of dinuclear compounds containing                      
              metals with vacant coordination sites.  Binuclear molybdenum                   
              compounds with sulfide and hydrosulfide bridging ligands have                  
              been synthesized and found to catalyze the oligomerization of                  
              isobutene.  Investigation of the mechanism of this reaction is                 
              planned so that the selectivity and stability of this catalyst                 
              can be compared to known catalysts for similar reactions.                      
                                                                                             
              One part of the investigation will focus on reaction surveys,                  
              stoichiometric reactions, and Extended Huckel Molecular Orbital                
              calculations to investigate the reaction mechanism.  A second                  
              part of the project will be to synthesize new compounds in                     
              which the bridging and/or terminal ligands have been altered to                
              enhance catalytic activity either by placing the substrate in                  
              proximity of the hypothetically critical bridging ligand or by                 
              increasing the likelihood that a vacant coordination site will                 
              form.
