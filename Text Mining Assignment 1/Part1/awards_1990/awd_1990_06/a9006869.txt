Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the acquisition of equipment to                          
              enhance research in the vibration analysis of linear and                       
              nonlinear systems.  The two relevant research projects                         
              address the development and verification of methods for                        
              predicting the vibration of nonlinear structures with                          
              random excitations, and the investigation and verification                     
              of computer modeling techniques for the design of                              
              electronic equipment subjected to shock and vibration.  The                    
              equipment requested comprises two computer workstations,                       
              software, and related peripherals.
