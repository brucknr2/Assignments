Abstract    :
                   Echinoderms are a phylum of invertebrates that include                    
              starfish, sea urchins and cucumbers, crinoids ("sea lilies"),                  
              sand dollars, and several extinct groups, known only from the                  
              fossil record.  One theory regards the echinoderms as the                      
              ancestral group from which vertebrates arose.  The evolutionary                
              relationships and history of diversification within the                        
              echinoderms has been the subject of research for many decades,                 
              and data from fossils, skeletal morphology, and most recently,                 
              DNA sequences have been amassed for this purpose.  These studies               
              have also attempted to place the echinoderms in the evolutionary               
              framework of other major animal groups.  Dr. Edward Ruppert is a               
              leading specialist in invertebrate developmental and comparative               
              biology, and he proposes research on the internal anatomy of                   
              echinoderms, with particular attention to the axial complex,                   
              which controls the water vascular system.                                      
                   The proposed research will have wide-ranging impact.  The                 
              new anatomical data will help to interpret the functional anatomy              
              of a diverse and worldwide group, and these data may help resolve              
              many remaining questions surrounding the group's evolution.  An                
              independent data set such as this will be compared with existing               
              data, such as the DNA sequences, opening opportunities for future              
              research on the mosaic nature of evolution among different                     
              character systems.  The results of this study will have a wide                 
              audience beyond echinoderm specialists.
