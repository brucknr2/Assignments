Abstract    :
                   This is a research program in a northern peatland ecosystem               
              to improve the understanding of surface fluxes of methane.                     
              Included in the program are the measurement and analysis of                    
              "really-integrated" methane fluxes, the characterization of                    
              pertinent environmental factors that control methane emission,                 
              and modeling to estimate annual methane emissions from major                   
              peatland types in the northern hemisphere.  Our experimental                   
              approach will utilize micrometeorological eddy correlation                     
              techniques, employing tunable diode laser spectroscopy (TDLS),                 
              for measuring surface fluxes of methane.  Conventional chamber                 
              methods will also be used to provide supporting information.
