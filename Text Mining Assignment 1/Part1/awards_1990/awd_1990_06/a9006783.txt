Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) reveals                           
              quantitative information about local bonding configuations                     
              and molecular motions in solids.  NMR of liquid samples is                     
              a well developed technology, and is used on a routine basis                    
              in chemical laboratories.  NMR of solid samples is a much                      
              newer technique.  Because or its fairly recent emergence, a                    
              great number of problems have yet to be addressed with                         
              solid state NMR.  Because of its unique capabilities, NMR                      
              holds enormous promise to help answer these problems.                          
              Funds are requested to construct an NMR spectrometer.  The                     
              system and its subcomponents are a dual channel,                               
              spectrometer double heterodyne system, with a wide bore                        
              (100mm) 4.7 Tesla magnet.  The hydrogen nucleus resonance                      
              frequency is 200 MHz.  Finally, the cost of rf components                      
              increases with frequency.  Constructing a spectrometer with                    
              a maximum frequency of 200 MHz decreases the cost relative                     
              to higher magnetic field systems without hindering the                         
              experiments we wish to perform.  In-situ NMR spectroscopy                      
              of chemical processing, hydrogen diffusion, and heat                           
              treatment of materials will require the construction of a                      
              special probe, which will contain gas tubing, heating                          
              elements, and thermocouples.  An instrument will be built                      
              for less than one-half of the cost of a commercial                             
              instrument of comparable specifications.
