Abstract    :
                   In warmer habitats, plants possessing the C4 photosynthetic               
              pathway have higher photosynthetic rates, greater potential                    
              productivity and greater competitive potential than the more                   
              common C3 species.  The vast majority of C4 plants, including the              
              economically important species such as corn and sugar cane, are                
              limited to habitats which are worm and sunny.  Since 1982,                     
              however, several species of the C4 grass Muhlenbergia have been                
              discovered in forest understory habitats at light  levels                      
              significantly lower than normal for C4 plants.                                 
                   This project investigates the photosynthetic responses of                 
              Muhlenbergia sobolifera, the most shade-tolerant C4 species                    
              known, to determine if it uses both photosynthetic pathways,                   
              either concurrently or in response to environmental cues.                      
              Because M. sobolifera is thought to have evolved regressively                  
              from the more common high-light, fully-functional C4 plants, an                
              understanding of its metabolic pathway will provide scientists                 
              valuable insight into the environmental pressures which lead to                
              the evolution of photosynthetic pathways.  In addition, this                   
              knowledge may lead to breeding approaches for producing plants                 
              with the desirable characteristic of both photosynthetic types.
