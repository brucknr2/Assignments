Abstract    :
              A new class of layered ferrimagnetic compounds consisting of                   
              ordered bimetallic layers with large spontaneous moments will be               
              synthesized.  Candidate materials include both planar macrocyclic              
              and non-macrocyclic systems.  The aim is to control magnetic                   
              parameters such as ordering temperatures, magnetic anisotropies,               
              and hysteresis curves by the choice of magnetic ions contained                 
              and the ligands that bridge them.  This award is part of the                   
              Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing Initiative, and it is              
              jointly funded by the Chemistry Division and the Division of                   
              Materials Research.
