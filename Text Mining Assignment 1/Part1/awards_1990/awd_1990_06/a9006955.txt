Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will continue an ongoing project               
              in the geometric calculus of variations and its applications.                  
              This will include an investigation into the geometric structure                
              of surfaces minimizing integrals with geometric integrands such                
              as area.  Additionally, he will study the evolution of surfaces                
              towards minimization and analyze the algorithms for their                      
              computation.  And he will begin a theoretical study of general                 
              evolution processes such as would model the growth of a crystal                
              as it freezes from its melt.  Geometric measure theory provides                
              the mathematical setting for these analyses and their                          
              applications in continuum mechanics.                                           
                   This project involves a variety of applications of geometric              
              measure theory as well as extensions of the theory itself.                     
              Crystal growth and soap films are two physical phenomena to which              
              this theory has already been applied.  The principal investigator              
              will study both the theoretical aspects of geometric measure                   
              theory and ways of developing software for its use in computer                 
              graphics.
