Abstract    :
              The functioning of the Ac transposable element in maize is                     
              controlled by its own product, transposase, that acts as a                     
              transactivating protein resulting in a steady state condition.                 
              Activation of Ac is associated with the demethylation of the                   
              promoter region.  Structurally altered, defective Ac elements                  
              that differ in the demethylation of their promoter by                          
              transposase will be employed in a study designed to determine                  
              the molecular basis for the promoter demethylation.  The second                
              part of this project involves an analysis of the long range cis                
              interaction between elements of the Ac-Ds system.  When an Ac                  
              and a Ds element are coupled on the same chromosome arms, the                  
              distal element becomes methylated and is not digested by                       
              methylase-sensitive restriction enzymes.  This effect is                       
              limited to elements coupled on the same chromosome arm, but                    
              they may be as far apart as 50 map units.  Many different double               
              and triple combinations of Ac, Ds and other marker genes will                  
              be constructed to study the nature of this long range cis                      
              interaction.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              During a period of previous NSF support, the author of this                    
              proposal has discovered that one gene can influence the                        
              behavior of another gene on the same, chromosome over much                     
              greater distances than previously imagined.  He now proposes                   
              to pursue this discovery, and attempt to elucidate the                         
              mechanism by which such long-range interactions among genes                    
              occur.
