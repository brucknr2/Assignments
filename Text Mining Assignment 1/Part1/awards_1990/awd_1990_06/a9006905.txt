Abstract    :
              This renewal aims to develop sensitive and selective chemical                  
              sensors for potential applications in environmental monitoring,                
              automated manufacturing processes and medical monitoring.  The                 
              collaborative project involves two PI's, one at the University of              
              New Mexico, and the other at Sandia National Laboratories, in an               
              effort to synthesize and characterize new thin films with                      
              molecular recognition capabilities.  Three different synthetic                 
              approaches will be explored:  (i) Zeolite-glass microcomposites;               
              (ii) thin-films with template controlled porosity; and (iii)                   
              surface crystallized channel structures.  This work is part of                 
              the Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing Initiative, and                
              it is jointly funded by the Chemistry Division and the Division                
              of Materials Research.
