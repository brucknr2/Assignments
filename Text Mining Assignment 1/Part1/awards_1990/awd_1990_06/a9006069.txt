Abstract    :
              The goals of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                   
              Organometallic Chemistry Program are to synthesize new                         
              transition metal-sulfur compounds, and to characterize these                   
              new compounds structurally and with respect to the reactivities                
              of the M-S bonds and the coordinated sulfur ligands. The                       
              important role of metal sulfur complexes in industrial and                     
              enzymatic catalysis is well-recognized.                                        
                                                                                             
              Previous studies have provided reliable and systematic methods                 
              for the synthesis of molybdenum complexes containing Mo=S bonds                
              or eta-2-bonded disulfur or tetrasulfur ligands. Analogous                     
              methods will be used to synthesize similar sulfur complexes of                 
              other early transition metals, such as Zr, Nb and Ta, and the                  
              structures and reactivities of the new complexes will be                       
              determined. The synthesis, characterization and reactivity                     
              studies of heterometallic clusters that contain various M-S                    
              functional groups will be carried out in attempts to evaluate                  
              the importance of bimetallic cooperative effects in the                        
              activation of specific molecules.
