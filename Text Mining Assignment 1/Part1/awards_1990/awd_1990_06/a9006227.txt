Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his study of the                 
              new 3-manifold invariants defined by Witten (in the context of                 
              quantum field theory) and by Reshetikhin and Turaev (in the                    
              context of representation theory of quantum groups).                           
              Applications of these invariants to central problems in low                    
              dimensional topology, including questions related to the Jones                 
              polynomial and to surgery on knots, will be investigated.  The                 
              invariants will be computed for a variety of examples, which can               
              be expected to reveal periodicity phenomena.  Machine computation              
              using Mathematica on a Macintosh IIci is feasible and will be                  
              undertaken.
