Abstract    :
                   The effect of floods on stream invertebrates has been the                 
              topic of a number of studies by stream ecologists.  Rapid re-                  
              establishment of populations following extreme floods is common                
              yet we do not understand the mechanisms responsible for this                   
              recovery.  This pilot project will begin to test the hypothesis                
              that debris dams lessen the detrimental effect of floods on                    
              stream meiofauna and that the effect of these mitigating patches               
                                                                                             
              (dam) will be greatest for those species with slowest                          
              reproductive rates.  Start up funds will be used to begin work to              
                                                                                             
              determine if faunal reproduction is rapid enough to account for                
              recovery of populations following floods.  Additional development              
                                                                                             
              time will be invested in determining if the high abundances of                 
              fauna near debris dams are linked to flood events.  This study                 
              will begin to provide data on the mechanisms determining which                 
              species of stream invertebrates persist at a given locale over                 
              time, and pave the way for longer project which will                           
              experimentally examine the interplay of dispersal, reproduction                
              and patch dynamics.
