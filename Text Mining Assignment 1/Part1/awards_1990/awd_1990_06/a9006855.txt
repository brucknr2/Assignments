Abstract    :
                   Professor Dye will investigate the problem of convergence of              
              products of linear or nonlinear projections in Hilbert space.                  
              The work would generalize von Neumann's famous result involving                
              two orthogonal projections.                                                    
                   The work involved finds application in such diverse areas as              
              the numerical solution of partial differential equations, linear               
              inequalities, mathematical programming, and image recovery to                  
              name a few.
