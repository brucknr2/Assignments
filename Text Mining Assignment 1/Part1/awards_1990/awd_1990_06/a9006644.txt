Abstract    :
                   Research will focus on variation that occurs within a                     
              species in three-dimensional branching structure of root                       
              architecture and determine the extent to which the variation is                
              genetically controlled or results from environmental factors.  In              
              the future, the relationship between root architectural traits                 
              and root function will be explored to determine the importance of              
              particular root structure to the overall performance of the                    
              plant.                                                                         
                   The study species is the herbaceous perennial Cryptantha                  
              flava (Boraginaceae) which occurs in very sandy soils throughout               
              semi-desert regions of eastern Utah and parts of adjacent states.              
              Because of the inherent difficulty of extracting roots from soil,              
              quantitative descriptions of root architecture and studies of the              
              relationship between the branching architecture of roots and root              
              function are virtually undeveloped.  Such information is basic to              
              understanding how plants capture soil nutrients and water.                     
                   Root structure should have particularly important                         
              consequences in desert systems where soil resources, rather than               
              available sunlight, limit plant growth.  The species selected is               
              amenable for these studies because the basic branching pattern of              
              its roots is easily quantified and because nearly entire roots                 
              can be extracted from the sandy soil.  Results of the study could              
              (1) help explain the distribution and performance of plant                     
              species across different soil types and (2) contribute                         
              information important to the development of crops--particularly                
              those tolerant to drought or low nutrient soils.
