Abstract    :
                   The research proposed seeks to demonstrate the feasibility                 
                                                                                            
              of testing complex, multifactorial hypotheses regarding the                    
              population dynamics and community organization of small mammals.               
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The approach is to conduct a series of fully factorial                         
              experiments in the field using penned populations.  The proposed               
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              experiments will determine if the results from earlier work, in                
                                                                                             
              which food and predation had equal and additive effects on the                 
              density of prairie voles, apply to meadow voles (a closely                     
              related species found in the same grassy habitats in central                   
              Illinois).  In addition, a third major environmental factor                    
              (interspecific competition) will be manipulated to see if factor               
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              interaction medicated by behavior influences the outcome of                    
              competition.  To accomplish these objectives and to test related
