Abstract    :
                   Flowering plants have been classified as self-incompatible                
              if they do not set seed following self-pollination, and self-                  
              compatible if they do.  Recent work shows that this fundamental                
              distinction is oversimplified.  Some plants, including the                     
              glacier lily, can produce selfed seeds if only self pollen is                  
              applied to the stigma, but will preferentially produce outcrossed              
              seeds from a mixture of self and outcross pollen.  The proposed                
              research uses genetic markers, pollen-color markers, and DNA-                  
              staining fluorescent pollen-nucleus markers.  Novel techniques                 
              for transplanting styles and for determining the genetics of                   
              aborted seeds will be combined with the markers to isolate the                 
              post-pollination stage(s) at which preferential ourcrossing is                 
              expressed following mixed pollinations.  The possible role of                  
              inbreeding effects will receive special attention.                             
                   The result should constitute the most complete investigation              
              to date of a little known, cryptic "incompatibility" process that              
              can potentially determine the level of inbreeding in a                         
              population.  Such knowledge will enrich any attempts to                        
              understand the function and evolution of plant reproductive                    
              systems, and may have practical utility in agricultural plant                  
              breeding, especially in the production of inbred lines for hybrid              
              seed production.
