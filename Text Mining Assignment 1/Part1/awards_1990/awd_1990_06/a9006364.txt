Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to define the mechanisms                     
              involved in regulation of transcription of bacteriophage Mu. Mu                
              early transcription is carried out by host function; middle                    
              transcription requires Mu functions and replication; late                      
              transcription requires the middle operon product C.  This project              
              will involve (1) isolation and analysis of phage containing                    
              middle operon mutations, (2) definition of the role of a                       
              transactivator protein Tam in activation of the middle promoter                
              Pm by cloning of the tam gene, overproduction and purification of              
              Tam protein, and characterization of its mechanism of action in                
              an in vitro transcription system and (3) determination of the                  
              role of DNA replication, overlapping transcription termination,                
              and specific DNA binding proteins (Mu repressors, transposase,                 
              and host IHF) on Pm activation by S1 nuclease and Pm-lacZ fusion               
              analysis under differing  levels of replication, termination and               
              binding proteins. The results should provide a detailed                        
              understanding of the mechanisms of transcriptional control                     
              exhibited by this novel bacteriophage, and thus should enhance                 
              our knowledge regarding this important target for cellular                     
              regulation.
