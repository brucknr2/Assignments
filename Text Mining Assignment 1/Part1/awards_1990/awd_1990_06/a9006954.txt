Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study conformal moduli and                
              the energy of incompressible flows, and the relationship between               
              circle packings and the geometry of Riemann surfaces.  The first               
              project involves an investigation into how knot types of field                 
              lines restrict arbitrary decreases in the energy.  The second                  
              project will be a continuation of earlier work on the convergence              
              of derivatives for hexagonal packing schemes.                                  
                   The principal investigator will carry out two projects in                 
              the area of geometric complex analysis.  The first involves a                  
              study of the behavior of fluid flow.  In particular, he will                   
              analyze the manner in which a flow loses energy or slows down                  
              when flow lines are knotted.  The second project involves the                  
              relationship between how a circle can be packed with smaller                   
              circles, and aspects of conformal complex analysis.
