Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to characterize the structure and               
              function of the plant vacuolar H+-ATPase.  The specific goals of               
              the project are (i) to determine the complete subunit composition              
              by further purification and immunoprecipitation; (ii) to study                 
              the subunit organization by dissociating and identifying the                   
              peripheral subunits; (iii) to deduce the primary structure and                 
              later to define the functional domains of selected subunits by                 
              cloning and sequencing the gene encoding the 16 kDa proteolipid;               
              (iv) to test the function of the 16 kDa proteolipid by                         
              reconstitution and molecular genetic methods; (v) to localize the              
              subcellular distribution of the ATPase; and (vi) to begin                      
              preliminary studies on the biosynthesis of selected ATPase                     
              subunits.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Plant cells contain a large central vacuole that occupies up to                
              80% of the cell volume.  They are important for maintaining cell               
              turgor and for the storage of ions and metabolites.  Transport                 
              processes across the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) are controlled              
              by electrochemical gradients that are determined in part by the                
              tonoplast localized vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPases) which is a                     
              proton-pumping ATPase (H+-ATPase).  The V-ATPases represent a                  
              class of ATPase that is present in the endomembrane system of all              
              eukaryotic cells.  Thus, investigations on the structure and                   
              function of the plant vacuolar ATPase has relevance to the                     
              function of the endomembrane system in all higher organisms.
