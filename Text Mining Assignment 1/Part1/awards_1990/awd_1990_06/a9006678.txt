Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study problems in                         
              Lorentzian, Riemannian, and pseudo-Riemannian geometry.  He will               
              build from his earlier work involving a Lorentzian analogue of                 
              the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem of Riemannian geometry.                  
              This work will entail an analysis of the existence of timelike                 
              lines in space-times obeying suitable curvature, causality, and                
              completeness conditions.  In another vein, he will use minimal                 
              surface theory to demonstrate the simplicity of spacial topology               
              near a black hole.  Lastly, he will investigate as to whether                  
              compact pseudo-Riemannian manifolds have closed geodesics.                     
                   The principal investigator will study several problems                    
              related to the geometry of space-time.  Einstein was the first to              
              suggest that the universe is a four-dimensional dynamic                        
              hypersurface which both restricts the movement of masses and is                
              curved by their gravity.  In this project, mathematics developed               
              for the study of more general hypersurfaces will be applied to                 
              the specific hypersurfaces which are used to model our space-                  
              time.
