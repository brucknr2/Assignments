Abstract    :
              Traditional (e.g., relational) database systems cluster data on                
              disks in order to minimize the cost of accessing information;                  
              such mechanisms are simplistic and are designed before the system              
              is put into use - and are never changed. But new applications are              
              making bigger demands on database systems. An example is aircraft              
              engineering, where multiple designers simultaneously perform                   
              ever-changing manipulations on complex integrations of electronic              
              and mechanical engineering components. This is in contrast to                  
              data processing, where highly-predictable data manipulations are               
              typically performed. This has caused data clustering to emerge as              
              a critical area demanding newer and more powerful algorithmic                  
              results. The goal of the self-adaptive clustering project is to                
              consider the wide variety of factors that come into play when one              
              considers clustering algorithms which are not constructed in                   
              advance and can adapt themselves to changing, unusual database                 
              access patterns. This will lead to the development of a theory of              
              self-adaptive clustering, which will be of great significance to               
              a wide variety of database users, in particular CAD/CAM,                       
              software, printed circuit board, and VLSI designers.  This will                
              provide a spectrum of software algorithms which will transform                 
              overly-expensive applications into cost-effective systems.
