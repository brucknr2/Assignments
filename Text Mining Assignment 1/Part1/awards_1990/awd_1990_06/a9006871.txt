Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is associated with the                                             
              Engineering Research Equipment Grants                                          
              program.  Funding is provided for the                                          
              purchase of specific equipment items; these                                    
              are for use in the cross hole seismic                                          
              technique.  The goal is to measure in situ                                     
              the damping characteristics of soils.                                          
                                                                                             
              A knowledge of the strength, stiffness and                                     
              damping properties of soils is fundamental to                                  
              earthquake hazard mitigation.  Many                                            
              techniques have been developed to measure                                      
              strength and stiffness properties, but the                                     
              measurement of damping properties in situ has                                  
              proven very difficult.  The cross hole                                         
              seismic method shows a lot of promise in this                                  
              regard.
