Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nerve cell activity depends on various ions crossing the cell                  
              membrane through channels that are sometimes very specific.                    
              These channels are formed by protein molecules in the membrane.                
              Nerve cells often have a long process, the axon which extends                  
              from the cell body known as the soma.  Often channels in the axon              
              are distributed differently from those in the soma.  This                      
              research addresses the question of how different proteins, which               
              are continuously synthesized in the soma of nerve cells, are                   
              spatially distributed.  This project will examine the molecular                
              mechanisms of sorting sodium channel proteins in nerve cells.                  
              Sodium channel proteins are synthesized in the soma, but are                   
              found in the membrane of the axon and are absent in the soma. In               
              the squid, an invertebrate, mRNA coding from rat sodium channels               
              will be injected into the soma.  As a result the cells will                    
              synthesize two different types of sodium channels making it                    
              possible to compare the spatial distribution of the two protein                
              molecules.  The part of the molecule responsible for its peculiar              
              spatial distribution can be changed by changing the coding and                 
              thus is able to be identified.  This study will advance our                    
              understanding of long-term regulation of how nerve cells                       
              function.
