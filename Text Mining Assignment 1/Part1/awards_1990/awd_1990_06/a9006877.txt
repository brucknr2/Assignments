Abstract    :
                   The taxonomic classification of the southern hemisphere                   
              plant family Proteaceae, distributed in Australia, South Africa,               
              and South America, is based largely upon morphological features                
              of the flowers and fruits.  About 67 genera and 1450 species are               
              currently recognized.  To test the classification of these plants              
              with new data, Dr. Sylvia Feuer of DePaul University is                        
              investigating the pollen structure and sculpturing of                          
              representative samples using light- and electron-microscopy.                   
              Fine details of the pollen wall surface and wall layering are                  
              being analyzed with cryosections and with transmission electron                
              microscopy, to obtain information useful in determining                        
              equivalent features for comparison among pollen from different                 
              genera.  Patterns of pollen wall structure and sculpture are                   
              expected to be similar among closely related groups of taxa, and               
              to exhibit recognizable trends of evolutionary change.                         
                   Differences among pollen grains of this family that are                   
              being described by Dr. Feuer will also allow determination of the              
              correct taxonomic association of dispersed fossil pollens.                     
              Grains thought to be from Proteaceae occur in deposits in the                  
              northern hemisphere, far outside the current geographic range of               
              the family.  Accurate determination of their taxonomic status is               
              prerequisite to resolution of the historical biogeography of                   
              these plants and to further analysis of climatic and other                     
              controls on plant distribution.
