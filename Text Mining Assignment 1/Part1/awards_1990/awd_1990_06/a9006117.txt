Abstract    :
                   The reseach involves the exploration of the implications                  
              of the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions.                  
              This investigation is particularly important as experimental                   
              particle physics moves to higher energy.  Predictions of the                   
              standard model are necessary either to confirm the foundations                 
              of the model or to aid in recognizing its limitations.                         
              Specific topics include the properties of the Higgs sector and                 
              the detectability of the Higgs boson using the effective gauge                 
              boson approximation to study W and Z boson fusion processes,                   
              unitarity effects in guage boson scattering, one-loop                          
              corrections to gauge boson scattering amplitudes, QED                          
              corrections to bound state energy levels and the effects of                    
              quantum chromodynamic corrections to the quark-antiquark short                 
              distance potential on the spectrum of heavy quarkonia.
