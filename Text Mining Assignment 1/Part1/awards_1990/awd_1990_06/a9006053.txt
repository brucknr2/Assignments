Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Lasers provide the chemist and physicist with the means of                     
              carrying out high resolution, high sensitivity experiments                     
              using most of the infrared to ultra-violet spectrum.  If laser                 
              instrumentation is combined into a central laser laboratory,                   
              the research of a group of top-notch investigators can be                      
              effectively enhanced.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The Department of Chemistry at Purdue University will use this                 
              award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to help acquire                
              modern laser instrumentation.  The areas of research that will                 
              will be enhanced by the acquisition include the following:
