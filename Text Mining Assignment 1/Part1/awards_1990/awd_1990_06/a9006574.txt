Abstract    :
                   Pagurus is a genus of shell-dwelling crustaceans, commonly                
              known as "hermit crabs".  They are diverse and abundant around                 
              the world, and they have been the subject of countless studies by              
              ecologists and population biologists.  The fact that hermit crabs              
              inhabit snail shells has probably directed the evolution of their              
              carapaces and appendages along certain narrow pathways, and this               
              phenomenon of convergence has produced a tangled taxonomy and                  
              classification for the group.  Dr. Patsy McLaughlin proposes an                
              ambitious study of the 147 described species of hermit crabs, in               
              which she will describe larval, juvenile, and adult                            
              characteristics.  Rearing protocols will provide a wealth of new               
              data on the developmental pathways of individual species.  The                 
              resulting data will form the foundation for future analyses of                 
              evolutionary relationships within this group.                                  
                   The proposed research will have a wide audience beyond the                
              community of hermit crab systematists.  Marine ecologists and                  
              zoogeographers, functional morphologists, developmental                        
              biologists, and a variety of other disciplines will use the                    
              resulting evolutionary relationships as a framework for future                 
              comparative studies.  Evolutionary biologists will appreciate                  
              this study's focus on how mechanical constraints of growth and                 
              function can channel the path of evolution.
