Abstract    :
              This meeting addresses the growing interest in using optoelectronics           
              for broadband analog applications, especially cable television                 
              distribution and microwave signal transmission.  Performance of                
              optoelectronic devices such as lasers, modulators, and detectors               
              determines the feasibility of most examples of these systems.  By              
              bringing together the technical communities representing device                
              development, equipment manufacturing and system operation, the meeting         
              will provide a unique forum for exploring the future of this field and         
              for creating a better understanding of its needs and capabilities.
