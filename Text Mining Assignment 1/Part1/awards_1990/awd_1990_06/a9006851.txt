Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research equipment award will be used to purchase advanced                
              test equipment and instrumentation for ice testing.  The physical              
              properties, deformation processes, and mechanical properties of                
              both freshwater and sear ice will be studied.  Applications include            
              arctic and antarctic operations, shipping on frozen sea and river              
              lanes, and development of safe structures subjected to ice forces.
