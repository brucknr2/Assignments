Abstract    :
                   The problems to be studied are among the kernel problems of               
              symplectic topology.  The topics include:                                      
                   Classification of contact structures and, especially,                     
              fillable contact structures on 3-manifolds; influence of the                   
              topology of a pseudoconvex (or contact type) boundary on the                   
              topology of a complex (or symplectic) manifold; classification of              
              Legendrian knots; definition and study of capacity-like                        
              symplectic invariants for contact manifolds; Smale-type theory                 
              for plurisubharmonic functions; metrical properties of the                     
              symplectomorphism group; developing the technique of filling by                
              holomorphic discs and its applications.                                        
                   It is important that these problems are at the frontier of                
              several complex variables and symplectic geometry, so both fields              
              will benefit from progress in this direction.  Profound                        
              connections to mathematical physics also lie in these areas of                 
              analysis and geometry.
