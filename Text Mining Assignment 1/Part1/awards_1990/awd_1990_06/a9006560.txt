Abstract    :
              This research focuses on data analysis and theoretical modeling of             
              solar radiation in the high latitude Southern Hemisphere using                 
              measurements obtained by NSF spectroradiometers located at Palmer              
              Station, Antarctica and Ushuaia, Argentina.  The objectives are to             
              define and quantify the physical mechanisms responsible for                    
              observed variations in surface irradiance in the ultraviolet and               
              visible regions of the spectrum, with emphasis on the former.                  
              Variations to be studied span time scales of hours, associated with            
              fluctuations in cloudiness, to several years, where changes can                
              arise from differences in local cloudiness and ozone levels from               
              one year to the next.  Special attention will focus on ultraviolet             
              radiation levels measured during the springtime ozone depletion                
              over Palmer Station and a search for any effects at the lower                  
              latitude of Ushuaia.  The results will provide a comprehensive                 
              description of the radiation environments at Palmer Station and                
              Ushuaia in the visible and biologically relevant ultraviolet                   
              portions of the spectrum.
