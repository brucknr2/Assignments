Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in algebraic combinatorics               
              of Professors Adriano Garsia and Jeffrey Remmel of the University              
              of California at San Diego. They plan to develop combinatorial                 
              algorithms for the construction of representations and their                   
              decompositions into irreducible components. Among the specific                 
              topics they will work on are: the new Macdonald polynomials and                
              their possible setting in representation theory; the structure of              
              descent algebras of Coxeter groups; and the explicit evaluation                
              of the coefficients in Schur function expansions in certain                    
              symmetric formal power series.                                                 
                   This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,               
              which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                 
              Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the               
              very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                    
              modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                
              counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                
              techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the              
              field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                 
              because of its importance in communications and information                    
              technology.
