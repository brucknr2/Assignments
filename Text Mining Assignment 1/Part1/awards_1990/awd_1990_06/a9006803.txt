Abstract    :
              In a number of cases, tuned mass dampers (TMDs) have been found to             
              be an appropriate method to suppress vibrations in buildings,                  
              floors, sports arena, and other structures.  The method is most                
              effective for structures with low damping.  Essentially, passively             
              damped oscillators are added to the structure, and tuned to                    
              maximize the damping for the modes of the coupled structure-TMD                
              system.  By ensuring that the critical modes involve strong                    
              participation of the TMD, it is possible to achieve substantial                
              amounts of damping for the coupled system, even if the mass of the             
              TMD is only a small fraction of that of the structure.                         
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to develop a general methodology for optimum tuning             
              of the TMDs.  More precisely, this methodology will yield optimum              
              values of the spring stiffnesses and damping coefficients of the               
              TMD's for given TMD masses and locations.  The effects modal                   
              interaction will be included, yet the approach is simple enough to             
              be accessible to practicing engineers.  An additional advantage of             
              the proposed method is that it only requires a very concise                    
              description of the dynamic properties of the structure.  This                  
              description can for the most part be obtained from field vibration             
              measurements.
