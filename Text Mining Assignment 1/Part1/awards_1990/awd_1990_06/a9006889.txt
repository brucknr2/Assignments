Abstract    :
              This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program will provide partial                
              travel and conference costs for approximately 40 U.S.                          
              scientists attending the XIII IUPAC Symposium on                               
              Photochemistry, to be held in Warwick, Coventry, England from                  
              July 22-28, 1990.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Challenge grants in the range of $500-$1,000 will be awarded to                
              successful applicants (to be selected by the Principal                         
              Investigator in consultation with the U.S. invited speakers and                
              U.S. members of the organizing committee for the Symposium).                   
              The selection process will emphasize efforts to invite and                     
              assist the participation of women, underrepresented minorities,                
              and younger chemists.  The IUPAC Photochemistry Symposium                      
              traditionally has a broad scope, fostering the fruitful                        
              exchange of ideas and information among scientists from the                    
              diverse areas that comprise the field of photochemistry.  Many                 
              strong international collaborations have resulted from                         
              interactions that were initiated at previous Symposia, and this                
              benefit is anticipated to continue.
