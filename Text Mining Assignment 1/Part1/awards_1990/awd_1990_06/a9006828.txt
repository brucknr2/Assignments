Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Prolactin is a hormone that is secreted by the pituitary gland.  It            
              plays an important role in reproduction, growth and development, and in        
              osmoregulation in animals.  In the teleost fish, tilapia, there are            
              two forms of prolactin both of which appear to play a central role in          
              osmoregulation.  Dr Grau will continue to characterize these forms of          
              prolactin in the teleost fish and will focus on those factors that             
              control their release from the pituitary gland.
