Abstract    :
                   Dr. Jeffrey Thomason is a leading investigator into the                   
              functional characteristics of the skull and jaw complex in                     
              mammals.  He has hypothesized that the shape of cranial bones has              
              evolved, in large part, to resist the tendency to bend when                    
              chewing forces are applied.  By measuring the biting forces                    
              exerted during chewing, and approximating the strength of the                  
              bones using engineering principles based on structural beams, Dr.              
              Thomason has been able to learn how closely the strength counters              
              the stress applied to each bone.  This study will be extended to               
              carnivores with very different body sizes, and to a sample of                  
              ungulate species.  The generality and precision of Dr. Thomason's              
              hypothesis will be tested using these results.                                 
                   The proposed research will find a wide audience among                     
              mammalogists, functional morphologists, evolutionary biologists,               
              and even medical engineers and orthopedic surgeons.  This                      
              research will expand our knowledge of the functional performance               
              of the mammal skull, and will test a fascinating proposal for how              
              evolution might be guided.
