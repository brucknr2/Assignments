Abstract    :
                   Voles are unique because of their central role in ecosystem               
              food chains, the density cycles that many populations undergo,                 
              their potential to cause human health and agricultural problems,               
              and their role as a general model of population regulation.                    
              Currently there is no explanation for the vole cycle of density                
              but there is great interest in understanding this phenomenon from              
              both the scientific and agricultural communities.                              
                   In order to test possible mechanisms of population                        
              regulation, Dr. Tamarin and his colleagues have developed a                    
              technique to determine relatedness in field animals using                      
              radioactive isotopes and electrophoresis, a protein separation                 
              technique.  Research in the past has resulted in estimates with                
              confidence in maternity but reduced confidence in paternity                    
              because these estimates relied on electrophoresis that, due to                 
              limited marker genes, did not reveal sufficient variability.                   
              Recombinant DNA techniques, now available to overcome these                    
              problems, will be used to give near certain estimates of                       
              paternity.
