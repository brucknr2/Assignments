Abstract    :
              The major area of research of this grant is wave                               
              scattering from rough surfaces with emphasis on                                
              numerical studies of rough surface scattering                                  
              models with the objective of developing a                                      
              surface scattering model that accurately predicts                              
              acoustic wave scattering, first from the ocean                                 
              surface and later from the ocean bottom.                                       
              Ultimately, what is needed is a model that will                                
              work for the most general type of boundary                                     
              condition and that can be used for                                             
              electromagnetic waves as well as acoustic and                                  
              optical waves.  This is a very difficult problem                               
              which researchers have been working on for                                     
              decades.  It is only with the recent introduction                              
              of high-speed computers and workstations that                                  
              a solution has become practicable.  In particular                              
              investigation into such problems as the detection                              
              of ship wakes and the estimation of wave height                                
              and direction will be carried out.  Co-                                        
              investigators will include a physical                                          
              oceanographer, a signal processor, a fluid                                     
              dynamicist, a fluid experimentalist, and                                       
              acoustician, a surface scattering modeler and are                              
              currently searching for a remote sensing                                       
              experimentalist and an image processor to fill                                 
              positions in the electrical engineering                                        
              department.
