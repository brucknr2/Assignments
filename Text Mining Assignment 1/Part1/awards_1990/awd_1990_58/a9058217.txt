Abstract    :
                   The PI plans research on the kinematics and dynamics of                   
              deformation in plate boundary zones, through field observations(               
              structural mapping to determine faulting histories and amount and              
              direction of motion), subsurface observations (including                       
              measurements of the stress field in various plate tectonic                     
              settings, particularly around the active plate boundaries), and                
              kinematic predictions from plate-tectonic observations.                        
                   An aspect of these studies is the test of kinematic                       
              predictions, derived from a knowledge of relative plate motions,               
              compared against the strain history observed along a particular                
              plate margin.  Such tests are potentially applicable to many                   
              plate boundaries, especially the Pacific North American Boundary               
              and the New Zealand region.  Both areas will be investigated.
