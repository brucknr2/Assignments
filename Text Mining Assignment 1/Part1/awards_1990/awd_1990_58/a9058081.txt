Abstract    :
              This research by a Presidential Young Investigator is focused                  
              on the application of a new and powerful measurement technique                 
              for turbulent flows to strengthen the linkage between                          
              experiments and numerical modeling in this area.  The focus is                 
              on coherent, organized structures.  The technique is particle                  
              imaging velocimetry, from which multi-point, multi-dimensional                 
              velocity field data can be extracted.                                          
                                                                                             
              Experimental information of this kind is badly needed to                       
              enable the development of more realistic models for complex                    
              turbulent flows involved in mixing and the separation of flow                  
              from boundaries.
