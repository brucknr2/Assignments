Abstract    :
              One of the major as yet unanswered questions with respect to                   
              synthesis and function of protein complexes in biological                      
              membranes is how these complexes assemble into functionally                    
              active entities.  To address this question with respect to                     
              photosystem II (PS II), the convenient transformation system of                
              the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is being utilized                
              to create a number of PS II mutants containing site-directed                   
              mutations.  Such mutants offer an excellent experimental system                
              to determine the role cofactors (particularly quinones and                     
              chlorophylls) play in PS II assembly and stability.  It is known               
              from other systems that the presence of chlorophyll is a                       
              requirement for stability of chlorophyll-binding proteins,                     
              whereas in higher plants synthesis of one of the chlorophyll-                  
              binding in PS II appears to depend on the availability of                      
              chlorophyll.  For this reason, mutations in presumed chlorophyll-              
              binding residues are now introduced to investigate the effects on              
              the synthesis and stability of the chlorophyll-binding proteins                
              as well as of the entire PS II complex.                                        
                                                                                             
              With the Presidential Young Investigator Award, the study of the               
              synthesis and function of photosystem II (PS II) of the                        
              photosynthetic apparatus is being significantly enhanced, thus                 
              contributing to a comprehensive insight into its involvement in                
              photosynthesis.
