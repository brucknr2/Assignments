Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With a Presidential Young Investigator award from the National                 
              Science Foundation, Dr. Peter Salovey will continue his work one               
              motion as a central organizing process in human perception,                    
              cognition, and action.  Salovey's recent work has focused on the               
              effects of mood on important human decisions:  for example, he                 
              has shown that transient mood states influenced the manner in                  
              which people interpreted and evaluated physiological sensations.               
              These evaluations had important consequences for decisions that                
              had critical implications for their physical health.  In other                 
              research, Salovey has shown how comparisons among individuals can              
              give rise to envy and jealousy, and how these emotions can be                  
              influenced by aspects of the situation that appear to have little              
              to do with them.  Salovey's work is important for several                      
              reasons.  Substantively, it heralds important new developments in              
              the study of emotions. In terms of scientific progression, the                 
              work is a departure from the more simple information processing                
              approaches, which conceptualized human decision making as little               
              different from that of a computing machine.  The new view, with                
              Salovey as one of the major proponents, sees human information                 
              processing as closely influenced by such human features as mood                
              and emotion. This is a more realistic, if more difficult,                      
              approach, which in the hands of a skilled scientist of Salovey's               
              talent, will pay enormous dividends.
