Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research addresses transducers and measurement systems                    
              using ultrasound for applications in bioengineering.  The                      
              research goal is the development of an ultrasonic                              
              measurement system with a mechanically adjustable focus,                       
              achieved by use of a waveguide.  The adjustable focus                          
              allows control of spatial resolution and penetration depth                     
              based on the physical profile of the acoustic field.  By                       
              controlling these parameters, the measurement system may be                    
              used to investigate biological systems of variable size,                       
              shape, and density.  After an initial study of waveguide                       
              materials, potential waveguides will be designed,                              
              fabricated, and coupled with transducers.  Their beam                          
              profiles will be measured and compared with predictions.                       
              Laboratory tests will be developed to demonstrate                              
              application of the system to blood flow measurement and                        
              dynamic characterization of soft tissue.
