Abstract    :
              Dai         Interconnection topology and metrics needed for laying out 
              high-speed interconnections in multi-chip modules are being  pursued.  The
              first topic is optimal design of transmission lines  for multi-chip modules
              (MCM).  These are self-damped lossy  transmission lines in a tree network,
              which propagates high-speed  signals.  Algorithms to implement a robust method
              for designing  these transmission lines are being developed.  Attention is paid
               to distortion-free signal propagation, cross-talk, switching  noise, and
              thermal resistance.  The second topic is routing of  clock signals for optimum
              system performance.  An algorithm is  being developed to construct a planer
              clock tree which can be  embedded on a single layer of metal.  Path length from
              the clock  source to each clock terminal is exactly the same.  The third  topic
              is a multiple bus network for parallel processing which  matches the MCM
              requirements of higher I/O pin count and inter-  chip routing density.  An
              algorithm with good fault tolerant  properties that leads to uniform bus load
              and processor fanout is  being developed.
