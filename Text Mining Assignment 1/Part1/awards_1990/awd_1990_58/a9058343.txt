Abstract    :
              This PYI's research is associated with the optical properties of               
              semiconductors.  His principal activity has been in the area of                
              light scattering and he was a pioneer in studying interference                 
              effects in Raman scattering.  Some of his current research                     
              involves light scattering from semiconductor heterostructure                   
              interfaces.  He is also collaborating with G. Maracas on the                   
              physics and engineering of brand offsets in strained-layer                     
              semiconductor heterojunctions.  There is also a second                         
              collaboration with H. Hochst in the growth and characterization                
              of amorphous tin-germanium alloys.  The PYI award will allow this              
              investigator to complete the installation of a sophisticated                   
              light scattering laboratory and to concentrate in opening new                  
              research areas.
