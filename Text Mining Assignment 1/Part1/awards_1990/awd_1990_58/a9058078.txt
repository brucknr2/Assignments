Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The focus of this PYI-directed research program will be on                     
              colloidal particles and the focus associated with their                        
              transport.                                                                     
              One force of fundamental interest is electrokinetic lift,                      
              which arises from the relative motion of charged bodies in                     
              electrolyte solutions.  Electrokinetic lift is significant to                  
              all particle transport processes including hydrodynamic                        
              chromatography, deep-bed filtration, suspension rheology, and                  
              the detachment of particles from surfaces during fluid flow.                   
              Given the broad applicability of this force, it is essential                   
              that one assesses the importance of electrokinetic lift in a                   
              given system.  Previous analyses of this force have focused on                 
              two bodies bearing thin, equilibrium double layers.  Such                      
              simplified models, while easy to theoretically characterize,                   
              are not technologically relevant.  For example, the analyses                   
              have shown that electrokinetic lift is more important in                       
              nonaqueous media, which are characterized by thick,                            
              nonequilibrium double layers.  The PI will initiate an in-                     
              depth analysis of this force, removing first the equilibrium                   
              double-layer restriction and, second, the thin double-layer                    
              restriction.  These theoretical studies will be coupled with                   
              experimental observation of lift.  Later, transport studies                    
              will then be extended to focus on the role of colloidal forces                 
              in the rheology of dispersions with application to coatings                    
              and films.  The results of this work will greatly enrich the                   
              fundamental understanding of the transport of colloidal                        
              particles.
