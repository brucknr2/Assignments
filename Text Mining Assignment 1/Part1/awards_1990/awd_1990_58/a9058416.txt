Abstract    :
              Animal cell culture is attractive for production of                            
              valuable proteins (e.g.,growth factors), and also                              
              provides a model system for studying responses of normal                       
              and diseased tissues.  The Principal Investigator (PI) is                      
              examining the regulation of cell growth, metabolism, and                       
              gene expression in response to selected environmental                          
              (pH, temperature, etc.) changes in well-characterized and                      
              controlled reactors.  Continuous suspension culture is                         
              used to facilitate analysis of step and pulse changes                          
              employed to probe cellular physiology mechanisms, and                          
              allows for adaption of cells to inhibitory conditions.                         
              The PI's research goals for the next five years are                            
              summarized as follows:                                                         
                -  Characterize increased antibody production by                             
                   hybridomas exposed to environmental stress (e.g. low                      
                   pH).                                                                      
                -  Evaluate the use of heat shock and/or                                     
                   glucose-regulated protein promoters to increase                           
                   productivity of recombinant animal cells.                                 
                -  Characterize cellular adaptations to changes in                           
                   oxygen partial pressure.                                                  
                -  Develop a well-characterized reactor system for                           
                   mixed cell populations.
