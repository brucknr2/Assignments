Abstract    :
              The thrust of this Presidential Young Investigator Award is to                 
              organize molecular components onto superconducting surfaces for                
              the purpose of developing superconductor-based macromolecular                  
              devices.  The initial focus will be on two areas:  (1)                         
              superconductor / molecular film junctions, using conductive                    
              molecular films such as polypyrrole and polyacetylene; and (2)                 
              optical devices prepared by coating Josephson junctions with                   
              thin-films of dyes such as metallophthalocyanines or rare earth                
              ions.
