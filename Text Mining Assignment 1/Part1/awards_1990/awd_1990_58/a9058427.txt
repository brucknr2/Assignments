Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award will support research               
              in optimal decision making under resource constraints (the theory              
              of bounded rationality) and studies of bias control for effective              
              concept induction in probabilistic domains.  A special thrust is               
              the incorporation of existing background knowledge in neural-                  
              network learning systems.  Dr. Russell will apply this work to                 
              robotic manipulator learning, path planning, and control                       
              architectures for simulated and physical robotic systems.  His                 
              research in bounded rationality and utility theory may have                    
              additional applications in other areas of decision making.
