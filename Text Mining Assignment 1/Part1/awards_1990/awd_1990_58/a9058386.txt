Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research is directed towards crystal solidification and sintering              
              research that impacts both metallic and ceramic alloy systems.                 
              A study of liquid phase infiltration techniques, applicable to                 
              advanced materials processing, is part of this effort.                         
              Sintering of powder compacts using finite element analysis                     
              focusses on sintering kinetics, grain growth during                            
              densification, and macroscopic stresses that arise during                      
              sintering and high temperature processing.  Studies of crystal                 
              growth include modeling of radiative heat transfer in the growth               
              of semitransparent crystals and surface structure formation.
