Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              PYI:Improved characterization of the mehanical properties                      
              of thin films and ion-implanted surfaces will allow                            
              optimization of the surface properties produced by these                       
              techniques, leading to improved performance of any number                      
              of optical, electronic and mechanical devices.  The goal to                    
              perform numerical simulations of the indentation process                       
              and test them with the use of our nanohardness tester, one                     
              of the few in the country.  The high precision and                             
              resolution of the nanohardness testers allows one to                           
              measure properties on much smaller scales than a                               
              microhardness tester, thus providing the capability of                         
              studying thin layers.  Large deformation finite element                        
              techniques will be used to study several effects associated                    
              with the testing of the properies of thin films and                            
              implanted layers.
