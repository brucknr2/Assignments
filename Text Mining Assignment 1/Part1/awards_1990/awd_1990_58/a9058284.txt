Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award to study floral                
              differentiation. Dr. Gasser will focus on the regulation and                   
              function of genes whose expression is confined to flowers, with                
              special emphasis on those gene with elevated expression in                     
              pistils.
