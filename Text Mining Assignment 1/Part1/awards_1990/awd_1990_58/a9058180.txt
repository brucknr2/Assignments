Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is the development of a formally verified             
              high level synthesis system for generating hardware descriptions from          
              concurrent programs.  Concurrent programs are widely used to specify           
              distributed systems such as communication networks.  However,                  
              specification is just one aspect of distributed system design.                 
              Implementing the specification requires generating hardware and                
              software components and, unfortunately, no methodology exists for              
              ensuring that this implementation is correct.                                  
                                                                                             
              The primary verification tool now used in hardware design is                   
              simulation.  Simulation cannot explore the full state space of complex         
              systems and hence does not give sufficient confidence of behavioral            
              correctness for safety critical applications.  The formal design               
              techniques developed for reasoning about concurrent programs do not            
              suffer from this "state explosion" problem; however, no existing               
              synthesis system can generate hardware from a concurrent program while         
              guaranteeing that behavioral properties are preserved.  This project           
              will develop the tools necessary to prove that a state-of-the-art high         
              level synthesis program is behavior preserving.
