Abstract    :
              The research plan is to develop a conceptual model, or framework,              
              of the information required to manage, plan, design, construct,                
              and operate a building.  This model has several development steps.             
                                                                                             
                   1.  Separate the information into that required drive to                  
                       process, and information required to describe the                     
                       product (building).  Separation will be based on the                  
                       NSF funded Integrated Building Process Model (IBPM),                  
                       current collaborative work with the NSF Engineering                   
                       Research Centers at Carnegie Mellon and Lehigh, and                   
                       industry input.                                                       
                                                                                             
                   2.  Define in detail the information required to control                  
                       and drive the process.                                                
                                                                                             
                   3.  Define the information that describes the building                    
                       product and link the function, form, economy and time                 
                       attributes of the building; at different levels of                    
                       abstraction, (e.g., building, system, floor, room and                 
                       component levels); from multiple perspectives, (e.g.,                 
                       structural, electrical); at the various stages in the                 
                       life of the facility (as defined by the process model).               
                                                                                             
                   4.  Develop a prototype data classification and coding                    
                       system to allow users to interactively access information             
                       from multiple perspectives in different forms.                        
                                                                                             
                   5.  Select a building representing a typical environment for              
                       implementation of this research, e.g., a 200,000 square               
                       foot mixed use building, and collect the information                  
                       specified by the framework or model.                                  
                                                                                             
                   6.  Test the key attributes of the prototype on the selected              
                       building by allowing the users to pose typical scenarios              
                       and queries to the prototype.  Analyse the information                
                       structure for absence and duplication of information.                 
                                                                                             
                   7.  Propose changes in information systems and processes to               
                       industrial participants.
