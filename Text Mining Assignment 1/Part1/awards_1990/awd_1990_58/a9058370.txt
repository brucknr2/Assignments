Abstract    :
              Dr. Regina Zibuck of the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse                   
              University will be supported by the Synthetic Organic Program                  
              as a Presidential Young Investigator.  Dr. Zibuck's research                   
              will focus on the total synthesis of structurally complex and                  
              biologically interesting natural products.  Equally important                  
              is the development of new methodology to address design and                    
              construction of enantiomerically pure starting materials.                      
                                                                                             
              Target molecules include podolide, the erythrophalamine                        
              alkaloids, and rubradirin, a thirteen member macrocycle.                       
              Methodology used for the rubradirin synthesis should be                        
              applicable to the preparation of many other morpholine-type                    
              natural products.
