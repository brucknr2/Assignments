Abstract    :
               Rapid prototyping is the process of quickly building and evaluating a  series
              of prototypes of a proposed system.  A computer-aided  prototyping system is a
              set of integrated tools supporting an  iterative prototyping process
              characterized by exploratory design and  extensive prototype evolution.  The
              goal of this research is to  investigate rapid prototyping of hard real-time
              systems via a  computer-aided prototyping system, which is based on a
              prototyping  language supporting the modeling of real-time systems and the
              reuse of  software components.  The research focuses on automated methods for 
              retrieving, adapting, and combining reusable components; establishing 
              feasibility of real-time constraints via scheduling algorithms;  simulating
              unavailable components via algebraic specifications;  generating translators
              and real-time schedules; constructing a  prototyping project database;
              providing design completion and error  checking facilities; and establishing a
              graphical interface for design  and debugging.
