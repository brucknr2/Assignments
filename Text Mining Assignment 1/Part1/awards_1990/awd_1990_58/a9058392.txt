Abstract    :
              Research will be carried out focusing on renewable                             
              resources and waste treatment.  The capabilities of                            
              living  systems will be explored in this context, using                        
              an integrated approach employing engineering, biological,                      
              and chemical principles.  A particular focus is                                
              fundamental understanding which could make a contribution                      
              toward the realization of applied goals.  Specific areas                       
              of interest include ethanol production from                                    
              lignocellulose, and anaerobic waste treatment and                              
              remediation.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Current and anticipated research related to ethanol                            
              production addresses metabolic control of product                              
              formation, cellulase kinetics, and bioreactor design.                          
              Thermophilic bacteria and enzymes are of particular                            
              interest.  Investigation of metabolic control will                             
              involve coupling understanding of microbial physiology                         
              and energetics with engineering approaches to                                  
              manipulating the fermentor environment in order to                             
              increase ethanol yields.  Bioreactor design for                                
              continuous fermentation of lignocellulosics at high                            
              concentrations will be pursued both experimentally and                         
              theoretically.  This will encompass consideration of                           
              plug-flow cellulose distribution, differential residence                       
              time of both cells and substrate due to substrate-broth                        
              density differences and cell-substrate adhesion                                
              phenomena, and modeling and understanding in vivo                              
              cellulose hydrolysis and fermentation.                                         
                                                                                             
              Approaches to anaerobic waste treatment and remediation                        
              will include selective inhibition of sulfate-reducing                          
              bacteria (SRB) via biochemically-based strategies.  In                         
              addition, the physiological basis for the relatively                           
              incomplete treatment often obtained by anaerobic systems,                      
              and possible solutions to this problem, will be                                
              addressed.  Finally, the use of anaerobic systems for the                      
              detoxification of hazardous wastes will be investigated,                       
              including both engineering and biological considerations.
