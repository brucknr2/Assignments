Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Full plans to continue studying animal energetics.  He wants to            
              determine whether or not the cost of locomotion is indirectly                  
              proportional to body size, if cost is independent of the number system.        
              He wants to unravel the underlying biomedical/biochemical basis by             
              looking at a diverse group of animals including ants, crabs,                   
              millipedes, lizards, birds, and mammals.                                       
                                                                                             
              Dr. Full is the first to employ miniature force plate to analyze forces        
              involved in movement patterns of tiny insects.  He will develop other          
              force plates to be applied in analyses of other animals.  This research        
              will aid in the development of general theory of animal design and             
              movement in general.
