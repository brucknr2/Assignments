Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to develop the tools by which the            
              impact of part design on manufacturing assembly can be                         
              fundamentally understood and continually improved.  To this end,               
              three objectives will be investigated:  (1) develop the physics of             
              part mating, with application to part design for flexible                      
              manufacturing assembly; (2) develop a measurement tool (dexterity)             
              which would be applied to models of the workholding and handling               
              aspects of the manufacturing process, analyze handling devices and             
              synthesize assembly systems; and (3) experimentally demonstrate                
              the usefulness of dexterity as a common measure of part feature                
              design and manufacturing assembly tasks.
