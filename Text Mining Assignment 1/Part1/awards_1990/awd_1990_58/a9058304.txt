Abstract    :
              Principal Investigator proposed to do research in the following                
              areas:                                                                         
                                                                                             
                   1.  Structural dynamic analysis of pressure vessels                       
                       (shells) to mechanical overpressures and intense                      
                       heat flux loadings, including computer modeling                       
                       of cumulative damage of shell walls due to cyclic                     
                       pressure loadings,                                                    
                                                                                             
                   2.  Mechanical and thermal stress analysis of reactor                     
                       components for fission safety,                                        
                                                                                             
                   3.  The mechanical modeling of x-ray lithography masks.
