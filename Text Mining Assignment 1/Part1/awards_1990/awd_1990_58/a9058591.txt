Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for a PYI award to an outstanding young              
              scientist interested in the development of new technologies to                 
              facilitate separation and isolation of very large DNA molecules.               
              His planned activities include the development of new methods for              
              enhancing the size resolution in separating very large DNA's, the              
              application of fluorescence light microscopy for image analysis of             
              single DNA molecules, and the study of biological functions of very            
              large DNA pieces, such as centromeres.  The ultimate goal of Dr.               
              Schwartz's research is to increase our understanding of physical               
              chemistry of biological macromolecules, which will enable molecular            
              biologists to isolate and characterize intact biological                       
              macromolecules such as genes, antibodies, and viruses.  As such,               
              the proposed research has potential for an immediate application               
              to the development of new analytical technologies as well as                   
              implications to fundamental biology.
