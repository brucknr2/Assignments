Abstract    :
                   This PYI research project in theoretical nuclear physics                  
              is aimed generally at understanding nuclear phenomena in terms                 
              of the underlying QCD field theory.  The large number of color                 
              limit of QCD will be used to investigate nuclear models, in                    
              particular, the spin content of the nucleon.  Other areas of                   
              research will study the consequences of chiral symmetry in                     
              nuclear physics, the role of field theoretical anomalies and                   
              the ideas of the color dielectric model.
