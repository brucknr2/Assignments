Abstract    :
              The focus of this research program will be the transport                       
              characteristics and device applications of heterostructured compound           
              semiconductors and intermetallics.  Two distinct intermetallic                 
              systems, the transition metal aluminides (e.g. NiA1) and the rare              
              earth monopnictides (e.g. ErAs) can be incorporated epitaxially in             
              compound semiconductor (e.g. A1GaAs) to fabricate multilayered                 
              semiconductor/metal/semiconductor heterostructures.  These novel               
              composites represent a revolutionary advancement in the materials              
              research.  They also provide the device physicists with powerful new           
              opportunities for engineering unique devices with transport properties         
              which are difficult or impossible to achieve in all-semiconductor              
              structures.  Previous work has shown that for sufficiently thin                
              layers, these semiconductor clad intermetallics exhibit two-                   
              dimensional quantum size effects in what is essentially a metallic             
              quantum well.  It has also been shown that these effects can be                
              exploited to fabricate quantum transistors operating at room                   
              temperature.  These transistors operate in a hidden-field effect               
              (HFET) mode where the electrodes are stacked in a vertical                     
              gate/drain/source structure.  The metallic drain screens (hides) the           
              gate potential from the drain-source junction yet the gate-drain field         
              modulates the energy of the resonance states in the metal which in             
              turn influences the drain-source junction tunneling current.  These            
              channelless vertical transistors can be  readily scaled down to the            
              minimum available process linewidths, and could therefore be                   
              attractive for future high density integrated circuits.
