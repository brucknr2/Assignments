Abstract    :
              Current research focuses on overcoming the                                     
              speed/sensitivity trade-off present in                                         
              semiconductor nonlinear materials and devices.                                 
              Extension of the single heterostructure Schottky                               
              barrier concept into a hybrid device is promising                              
              for development of simple to fabricate, high                                   
              sensitivity, high speed devices.  Applications                                 
              research for these devices include optical                                     
              dynamic random access memory, monolithically                                   
              integrated passive and active absorbers for                                    
              mode-locked semiconductor lasers, and spatial                                  
              light modulators.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Optoelectronic integration is a second interest                                
              area.  Deposition of optical material onto                                     
              electronic material has been achieved by Dr.                                   
              Jokerst at Georgia Tech by separating GaAs                                     
              devices from their substrate (lift-off) and                                    
              depositing the devices onto Si.  GaAs optical                                  
              and/or electrical devices can be lifted off and                                
              deposited onto any smooth material such as                                     
              glass or LiNbO3.  Current projects utilizing this                              
              technology include a 512 X 512 element optical                                 
              phase modulator for beam steering and optical                                  
              signal processing.  Solar cells created through                                
              lift-off are another project under investigation.                              
              Desirable high power to cost and power to                                      
              weight ratios exist for lifted-off solar cells since                           
              the expensive, heavy substrate is not longer                                   
              attached to the solar cell and further, can be                                 
              reused for growth.
