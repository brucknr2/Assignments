Abstract    :
              Almost all tissues are subject to physical and                                 
              environmental forces.  These tissues, in response, adapt                       
              and remodel to accommodate these forces.  Two prime                            
              examples are blood vessels and bone.  The former respond                       
              to the fluid shear and pressure of blood flow by adapting                      
              vessel diameter and undergoing wall remodelling. The latter                    
              responds to the stress, pressure and interstitial fluid                        
              flow due to mechanical loading by adapting and remodelling                     
              bone tissues.  Using cell culture techniques, the Principal                    
              Investigator's (PI)  research efforts have focussed on                         
              understanding the nature and the specific mechanisms of                        
              tissue response to physical forces.                                            
                                                                                             
              Having laid down the foundation in terms of techniques and                     
              understanding of the force-cell interactions, the PI                           
              proposes to engineer force bearing tissues such as bone and                    
              cartilage.  The overall objective is to develop several                        
              types of scaffolding materials (collagen, bioerodable                          
              polymers, and hydrogels) as the structural framework for                       
              bone and cartilage induction to be used as implants and                        
              grafts.
