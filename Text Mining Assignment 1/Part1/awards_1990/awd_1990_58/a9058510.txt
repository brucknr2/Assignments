Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator award will support the                    
              development of new instrumentation and observations dedicated to               
              the study of the intrinsic properties of quasars and the                       
              distribution of matter along the line of sight to these extremely              
              distant objects.  The Lyman-alpha "forest" of absorption lines                 
              seen in the spectra of high redshift quasars is generally                      
              ascribed to intervening pre-galactic or proto-galactic material                
              with the elemental composition of material fresh from the big                  
              bang.  By developing new, more powerful and sensitive                          
              spectrometers and using them to study this material and the                    
              quasars beyond them, this outstanding young scientist will probe               
              the physical processes occurring in the very early universe.
