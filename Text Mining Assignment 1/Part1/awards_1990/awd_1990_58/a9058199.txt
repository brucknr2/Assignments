Abstract    :
              The P.I. intends to demonstrate the integration of field geology               
              with quantitative laboratory investigations, geophysical                       
              modeling, and geochemical studies in the systematic examination                
              of Precambrian sedimentary basins.  This work will allow for the               
              deciphering of long-term continental evolution as well as the                  
              history of oceans and atmosphere, throughout most of earth                     
              history.                                                                       
              Two projects focus on the goals; the first will undertake an                   
              analysis of Proterozoic continental lithosphere trough                         
              investigations of the geometry and tectonics of foreland basins.               
              The second project will investigate the possible long-term                     
              chemical changes in the Precambrian atmosphere and oceans.  The                
              key study of this work will be a sedimentologic/geochemical                    
              analysis of Precambrian carbonate sediments and depositional                   
              systems.
