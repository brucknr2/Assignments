Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop and apply                           
              efficient methods for computing radiant energy                                 
              transfer.  The methods are being developed by                                  
              drawing on an expanding concepts and techniques                                
              from both engineering and computer science.  The                               
              ultimate goal is to develop methods which allow the                            
              simulation of radiant transfer in geometrically                                
              complex, dynamic environments.  A variety of issues                            
              are being considered.  The accuracy required in the                            
              modelling of environment geometry and material                                 
              properties is being studied.  The potential for                                
              speeding up the calculation of the effects of scattering                       
              by Monte Carlo and finite are (radiosity) methods is                           
              being explored.  The use of specialized and/or                                 
              parallel computer processors is being considered.                              
              The nature and format of output available during the                           
              solution process is also being studied.  The new                               
              computational methods are being applied to several                             
              different types of problems including the generation                           
              of photorealistic computer graphics images, the                                
              calculation of infrared signatures, and the simulation                         
              of illumination for the design of computer vision                              
              systems.
