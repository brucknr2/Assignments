Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator (PI) will continue research in                 
              the areas of integrated broadband networks, wireless information               
              networks, traffic theory, optical networks and distributed                     
              processing in a network environment.  He will set up a network                 
              research lab for concept demonstration which will include                      
              networked workstations for simulation and experimentation on                   
              protocol and multi-media applications.  The applications include               
              digital signal processing and micro-computing programming                      
              platforms; and network database and software installations.
