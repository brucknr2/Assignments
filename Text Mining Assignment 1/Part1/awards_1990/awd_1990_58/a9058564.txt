Abstract    :
              Experiments on the use of nonlinear transformations                            
              and nonlinear techniques in the Fourier domain of                              
              optical processors for optical image processing will be                        
              carried out.  Nonlinear transformation in the Fourier                          
              plane ca be very useful in a variety of applications                           
              such as pattern recognition, associative retrieval,                            
              image deconvolution, image enhancement, etc.  By                               
              introducing nonlinear transformations in the Fourier                           
              domain, image detection processed can be                                       
              significantly improved for the case of correlator based                        
              optical pattern recognition.  Various type of                                  
              architecture will be explored to implement nonlinear                           
              transformation at the Fourier plane.
