Abstract    :
              Intelligently assessing relevance is a central issue in AI.                    
              Whether in diagnosis, problem solving, or explanation, AI systems              
              must determine the information in a database that isrelevant to                
              the task.  Assessing relevance is difficult because it depends on              
              context.  This work focuses on resoning symbolically about                     
              relevance of cases or features in context in a computationally                 
              tractable way.  Integrating expanded domain theories, where such               
              theories are often ill-defined or partial, into the assessment of              
              relevance is a primary goal of the work.  The ultimate goal of                 
              this approach is to design an intelligent tutoring system that                 
              will train students to argue with cases.
