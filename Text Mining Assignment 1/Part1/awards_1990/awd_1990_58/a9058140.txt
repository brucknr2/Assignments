Abstract    :
              Many physical systems require nonsmooth mathematical                           
              models to capture their dynamical behavior accurately                          
              and easily.  The nonsmooth characteristics may arise due                       
              to specific system elements such as relays, saturation,                        
              dead zone, backlash or they may result from a                                  
              simplification in the modelling process.  In many                              
              applications, these nonsmooth nonlinearities are the                           
              major stumbling-block to model reduction, stability                            
              analysis, and control design.                                                  
              New methods will be developed to analyze and design                            
              control systems with nonsmooth dynamics.  Model                                
              reduction techniques such as singular perturbation theory                      
              will be extended to handle these types of systems.  Both                       
              the stability criteria and the control design procedures                       
              will be investigated to analyze specific nonsmooth                             
              characteristics.  The characteristics targeted will include                    
              both continuous and discontinuous nonlinearities and                           
              those found in power systems and in interconnected                             
              flexible structures.
