Abstract    :
              Eggers         The long range focus of this research is on improving the 
              performance of parallel programs.  One thrust uses compiler  technology to
              obtain better multiprocessor cache performance,  i.e., reduce the amount of
              sharing-related bus traffic.  The  initial phase of that work is the detection
              of false sharing and  measuring its impact on cache miss ratios and bus
              utilization.   Another area of investigation is measuring the amount and type
              of  program level parallelism in nonscientific parallel programs and 
              determining the levels of hardware parallelism that best execute  them.        
              The current focus of the research is in the following areas:  1.     Compiler
              reorganization of shared data;  2.     Runtime code generation; and  3.     A
              protection model for a single address space architecture.
