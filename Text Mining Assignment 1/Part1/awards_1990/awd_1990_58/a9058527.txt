Abstract    :
              Research interest will include: photoinduced                                   
              periodic structures in optical fibers, thin films                              
              and bulk media.  These periodic structures                                     
              enable efficient frequency conversion, optical                                 
              switching and dramatically altered dispersion                                  
              properties.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Frequency Conversion - The origin of efficient                                 
              second and third-harmonic generation (SHG and                                  
              THG) in optical glass fibers will be studied.                                  
              These studies will include writing gratings into                               
              optical fibers and bulk glasses with a new                                     
              holographic technique.  This technique involves                                
              exposing the outside of the fiber or bulk glass                                
              to interference fringes at the right periodicity                               
              for phasematching of either SHG or THG.  The                                   
              interference fringes will be produced by an                                    
              Excimer laser, with a wavelength of 248 nm                                     
              which is resonant with the GeO molecules in                                    
              the glass responsible for the photoinduced                                     
              periodicity.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Optical Switching - It has been shown both                                     
              theoretically and experimentally that periodic                                 
              structures can be used for optical switching.                                  
              Research into the use of the above mentioned                                   
              holographic technique to write periodic                                        
              refractive index changes into glass optical fibers                             
              to obtain switching will be carried out.  The                                  
              advantage of this method will be that arbitrary                                
              periodicities could be obtained by simply                                      
              changing the angle between the two interfering                                 
              beams and thereby allowing switching at an                                     
              arbitrary wavelength.                                                          
                                                                                             
              All-Fiber Pulsecompressor - Ultrashort optical                                 
              pulses can be obtained for wavelengths longer                                  
              than 1.3 microns in optical fibers due to                                      
              solitons.  The same type of compression can be                                 
              obtained for an arbitrary wavelength shorter                                   
              than 1.3 microns if an periodic refractive index                               
              perturbation has been written into the fiber.                                  
              The principal investigator would like to study                                 
              this further to make an alternative all-fiber                                  
              pulsecompressor for the visible and near-                                      
              infrared.
