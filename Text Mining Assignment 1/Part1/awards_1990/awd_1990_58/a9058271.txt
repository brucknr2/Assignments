Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The area of specialization for this PYI award is in separation                 
              methods used for production of recombinant proteins.                           
              Particular focus will be on protein adsorption and molecular                   
              recognition.  The research approach combines engineering with                  
              the tools of high-resolution separation methods.  The research                 
              approach combines engineering with the tools of molecular                      
              genetics and structural protein chemistry, with the aim of                     
              understanding the thermodynamic driving forces and structural                  
              basis of association equilibria.  While the work is of a                       
              fundamental nature, the understanding gained will aid the                      
              development of improved separation media and processes.  Some                  
              specific interests involve a fundamental study of the                          
              structural and thermodynamic basis for antibody affinity and                   
              ion exchange adsorption of proteins.                                           
                                                                                             
              By using the tools of directed mutagenesis and thermodynamic                   
              analysis to probe fundamental driving forces and structural                    
              determinants, one will eventually be able to understand                        
              separation processes from the most basic level.  This                          
              understanding will then be used to develop improved                            
              separations media and processes.
