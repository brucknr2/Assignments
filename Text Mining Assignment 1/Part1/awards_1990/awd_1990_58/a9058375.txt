Abstract    :
              With this Presidential Young Investigator Award from the                       
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program,                  
              Dr. Rinaldo Poli of the University of Maryland will synthesize                 
              and characterize new compounds of transition metals. The                       
              research will emphasize new compounds of molybdenum with odd                   
              numbers of electrons, with the catalytic activity of these                     
              being of especial interest.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The class of 17-electron compounds of the formula MoCpX2L2,                    
              where X=anionic ligand and L=neutral ligand such as phosphine,                 
              will be investigated. The effects of the nature of the ligands                 
              X and L on the electronic structure, bonding, redox properties                 
              and reactivity toward ligand substitution will be determined,                  
              with emphasis on derivatives where X is H, alkyl or aryl. The                  
              activation of small molecules, including carbon monoxide,                      
              dinitrogen, carbon dioxide and ethylene, by odd-electron                       
              systems will be investigated also.
