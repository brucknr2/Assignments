Abstract    :
                   The objectives of this research are to investigate and explain            
              the four basic steps of the welding of plastics and composites:                
              (1) heating and heat transfer, (2) squeeze flow, (3) intermolecular            
              diffusion, and (4) through experimentation and modeling.  The                  
              research will include:  determining the heating mechanisms and heat            
              transfer for internal and external heating methods, predicting the             
              squeeze flow of viscoelastic liquids under combined static and                 
              dynamic loadings, evaluating methods for measuring intermolecular              
              diffusion, investigating the effects of time, temperature                      
              pressure on diffusion and healing of weld interfaces, and                      
              evaluating the effects of cooling on microstructure and on residual            
              stresses and distortions.  The results of these studies will be                
              used to model new and existing welding processes like hot plate,               
              vibration, laser, infrared, resistance, induction, and others.  The            
              research will also determine the effect of process parameters on               
              weld quality, and enable development of sensors for closed-loop                
              control of these processes.  This research could lead to better,               
              faster, more reliable, and less costly manufacturing of                        
              plastic and composite structures.
