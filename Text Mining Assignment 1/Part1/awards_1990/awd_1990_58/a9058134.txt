Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award provides general                    
              research funds for Dr. Last's studies of mechanisms of gene                    
              regulation in plants and how plants regulate amino acid                        
              biosynthesis in response to environmental and developmental cues.              
              His model system for these studies is the tryptophan biosynthetic              
              pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana.  He also hopes to use some of his             
              own discoveries to develop improved methods for the genetic                    
              manipulation of this organism.
