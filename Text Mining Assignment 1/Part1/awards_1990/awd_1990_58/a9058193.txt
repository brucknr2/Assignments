Abstract    :
                   The PI intends to continue to two lines of scientific                     
              inquiry currently under investigation.  The first involves                     
              studies in ice sheet stability as a function of basal flow of a                
              deforming bed, where instability caused by marginal melting                    
              triggers ice sheet collapse.  Field and modeling work support the              
              idea of a triggering mechanism, and if correct, can also explain               
              the patterns of ice- related, sediment deposition associated with              
              glacial movement.                                                              
                   In addition the PI will continue work in the basic physics                
              of glacial ice, its transformation and implication to the broader              
              field of paleoclimatology.
