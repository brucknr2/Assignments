              H.During her five.year Presidential Young Investigator award,                  
              Dr. Root, University of Michigan, plans to continue                            
              investigating the factors affecting the distribution and                       
              abundance patterns of all birds wintering in North America.                    
              Two major studies are proposed.                                                
                                                                                             
              Initially, Dr. Root will investigate various physiological                     
              mechanisms that may cause winter ambient temperatures to shape                 
              the northern range boundaries of some birds.  Metabolic rates                  
              and various energy.storage and energy.use characteristics will                 
              be compared among several species at different sites along                     
              cross.continental, latitudinal transects.                                      
                                                                                             
              Study 2 will use the physiological information obtained in the                 
              first study to investigate the possible effect of global                       
              warming on avian biogeographical patterns.  This will involve                  
              the development of a theoretical model that addresses how the                  
              winter ranges of birds change, given a particular shift in                     
              ambient temperature.  Such a model could not only provide                      
              insight about the basic biology of North American avian                        
              communities, but also suggest management strategies for                        
              combating the negative impacts of climate change.
