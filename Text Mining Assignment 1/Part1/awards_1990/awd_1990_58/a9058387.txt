Abstract    :
              This presidential Young Investigator award encompasses three                   
              projects in the general area of ceramic and zeolite chemistry.                 
              One of these concerns mass-transport limitations in sol-gel                    
              synthesis; the rates of diffusion of small and large                           
              precursors in viscous reacting systems.  Another is the                        
              diffusion of guest molecules in zeolites and the influences                    
              thereon of zeolites structure, crystal defects and cation                      
              occupancy; both theory and experiment are applied.  The other                  
              project is a study of the chemistry and kinetic behavior of                    
              polyoxoanions, the precursors to zeolite-like materials and                    
              most ceramics; silicates, aluminates, borates, phosphates, and                 
              ferrites are studied.  A variety of techniques, both                           
              experimental and computational, are employed, with an emphasis                 
              on nuclear magnetic resonance methods.                                         
                                                                                             
              This effort is directly applicable to the synthesis and                        
              processing of zeolites, zeolite-like materials, and ceramics                   
              in general.  Some of it may also have application in polymer                   
              synthesis and processing and in processing of glasses and thin                 
              films.
