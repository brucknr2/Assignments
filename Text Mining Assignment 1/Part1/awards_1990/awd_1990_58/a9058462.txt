Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) Award - Planets and                      
              Asteroids.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Dr. Binzel will use this Presidential Young Investigator Award to              
              continue his multi-faceted observational and theoretical research              
              on the planet Pluto and asteroids in the Solar System.  For the                
              Pluto-Charon system, Dr. Binzel is attempting to derive physical               
              parameters, such as diameters, masses, and densitites, from the                
              rare geometry of the planet and its satellite.  Dr. Binzel's                   
              asteroid research involves studying the characteristics of                     
              clusters of asteroids which represent the outcome of large                     
              natural collision experiments.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Collisional processes are a significant factor in the evolution                
              of the remnant planetesimals known as asteroids.  By                           
              understanding the collisional processing that has occurred, the                
              original planetesimal population can be characterized and used to              
              constrain models for the formation of the Solar System.  The                   
              Pluto-Charon system is undergoing a once-per-century alignment                 
              which results in a series of mutual eclipses for Earth-based                   
              observers.  Careful observations of these events could lead to                 
              the derivation of physical parameters of the components of the                 
              system.  Dr. Binzel's research will address both the evolutionary              
              properties of asteroids, and precise physical properties of                    
              Pluto-Charon.
