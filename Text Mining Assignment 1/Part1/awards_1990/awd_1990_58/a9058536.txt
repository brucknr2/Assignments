Abstract    :
              Bushnell         The research is in various facets of automatic test pattern 
              generation (ATPG).  Problems being considered include:  false  timing path
              detection algorithms; reduction in memory  requirements for ATPG for very large
              state machines; neural net-  based, switch-level algorithms for ATPG; parallel
              algorithms for  ATPG; robust delay fault built-in self- testing circuits; 
              statistical delay fault simulation.  Software for algorithms is  being
              developed.  Additionally, a distributed data base retrieval  algorithm that
              operates on a network of work stations is being  explored.
