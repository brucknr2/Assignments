Abstract    :
              This is a PYI application from a new Assistant Professor                       
              of Electrical Engineering.  Dr. Hannaford received his                         
              Ph.D. from UC-Berkeley in 1985, and was employed by the                        
              JPL at Cal Tech until 1989.  He has numerous publications                      
              in the area of human motor control.  His plan is to                            
              continue his research to better understand how humans                          
              control their limbs, but he will be increasingly involved                      
              in robotics research as well.  His plan is to use the                          
              understanding of the natural motor system to design                            
              robotic manipulators.
