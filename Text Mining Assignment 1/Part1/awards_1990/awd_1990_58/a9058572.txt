Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              For this Presidential Young Investigator Award theoretical                     
              research will be conducted on quasicrystal growth and on the                   
              evolution of foams in two and three dimensions.  A quasicrystal                
              growth model will be developed within the context of a simple                  
              tiling model based on the six-vertex (ice) model of statistical                
              mechanics and its three dimensional generalization.  The effects               
              of dynamics on the evolution of foams will be studied by using a               
              simple one dimensional model.  These dynamical effects will then               
              be incorporated into more realistic models for foam evolution in               
              two and three dimensions.
