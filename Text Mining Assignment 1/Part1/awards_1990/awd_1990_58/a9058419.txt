Abstract    :
              The goal of this work is to develop a conductimetric microsensor for           
              glucose for potential application in an artificial pancreas.  The              
              sensor is to be formed by coating planar interdigitated electrodes             
              with a hydrogel that swells reversibly with water in the presence of           
              glucose.  The concomitant changes in the electrical conductivity of            
              the gel are manifest as a change in the electrical impedence of the            
              electrode structure.  The initial work involves development and                
              characterization of gels with suitable properties, followed by                 
              formulation of the gels into photomaskable forms compatible with IC            
              processing.  The project is also investigating a more sophisticated            
              sensing strategy, which uses multiple electrode geometries to attempt          
              to improve the specificity of conductimetric sensors.
