Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in Elementary Particle                       
              Physics by Dr. Barbara J. Neuhauser, a Presidential Young                      
              Investigator, San Francisco State University, CA.  The aim of                  
              the research in the development of superconducting detectors                   
              for weakly interacting non baryonic particles which may form                   
              the "dark matter" of the universe.  Since the identification of                
              dark matter particles depends upon the development of detectors                
              with a lower threshold of sensitivity than are offered by the                  
              best conventional particle detectors, the use of a new type of                 
              cryogenic detector, called a silicon crystal acoustic detector                 
              (SiCAD), has been proposed.  The research will consists in the                 
              development of extremely sensitive superconducting tunnel                      
              junction for use as phonon detector on this new detector.  The                 
              phonons are generated by the collision of an incident particle                 
              with a nucleus or electron in a cube of ultra-pure single                      
              crystal silicon cooled at very low temperature.
