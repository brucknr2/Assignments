Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to study and reduce to practice a             
              highly parallel architecture that supports emerging parallel languages         
              effectively.  It should support a variety of language disciplines,             
              including functional programming, logic programming, and CSP and               
              MultiLisp derivatives.  It should also simplify parallel execution of          
              "dusty decks" and annotated sequential programs.  It must be                   
              implemented as a replicable unit.
