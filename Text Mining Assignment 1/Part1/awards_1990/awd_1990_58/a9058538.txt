Abstract    :
              This research by a Presidential Young Investigator is focused                  
              on aerosol dynamics involved in laser-induced as well as                       
              conventional chemical vapor deposition.  The application is to                 
              ceramic superconductors.  The role of transport processes in                   
              laser-induced deposition will be examined through numerical                    
              modeling.  This will be complemented with experiments                          
              involving light scattering and electrical mobility techniques.                 
                                                                                             
              The research will enhance the ability to control processing                    
              parameters to improve and extend the properties of advanced                    
              ceramics.
