Abstract    :
              Rates of chemical reactions on metal surfaces are simulated                    
              using a dynamic Monte Carlo formalism.  The initial emphasis                   
              is on the adsorption step, with an attempt to predict the                      
              formation of islands and other nonstatistical patterns caused                  
              by adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, and on the effect of such                 
              interactions on the apparent (experimentally observable)                       
              activation energies of bimolecular reactions.  The work will                   
              be extended to thermal desorption systems as well.                             
                                                                                             
              The ability to predict to effects of index plane on the rates                  
              of various surface processes would be of great help both in                    
              the design of new selective catalysts and in the design of                     
              catalytic reactors.
