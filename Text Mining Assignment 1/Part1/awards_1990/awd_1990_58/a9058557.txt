Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this Presidential Young Investigator grant is to                   
              determine local electronic structure of defects in ceramics.  The              
              research uses scanning tunnelling microscopy with simultaneous                 
              photoexcitation to increase the free carrier concentration.                    
              Preliminary results have identified the potential to use this                  
              technique to identify structural and chemical defects in these                 
              wide band gap materials.  The observed increase and distinct                   
              variation in the conductance is a detector of photoexcitation                  
              processes, allowing optical spectroscopy to be performed with the              
              spatial resolution of scanning tunnelling microscopy.  The                     
              research is being done on silicon carbide and zinc oxide.  The                 
              effects of valence-to-conduction band excitation and defect-to-                
              conduction band excitation are being isolated.  Reflection,                    
              transmission electron microscopy and spectrophotometry are being               
              used as collaborative techniques.
