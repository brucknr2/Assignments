Abstract    :
                   Research will be carried out at the boundary between                      
              quantum field theory and mathematics.  The work will include                   
              studies of conformal field theory, lattice models which replace                
              the continuum of space by a discrete set of points, quantum                    
              groups, quantum gravity, von Neumann algebras, Teichmuller                     
              space, and other topics.  The work, to be carried out by one of                
              the new Presidential Young Investigators for 1990, is important                
              to our effort to understand gravity in the context of quantum                  
              theory and to the furthering of the growing, fruitful                          
              interaction between physics and mathematics.
