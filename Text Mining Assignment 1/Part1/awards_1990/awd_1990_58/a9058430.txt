Abstract    :
              Ramachandran         Beehive is a project that investigates the software and 
              hardware issues in the design of scalable shared memory  multiprocessors.  The
              architecture is designed to support a form  of weakly consistent memory model
              in a cache-based multiprocessor  environment.  The novel aspects of the
              architecture are reader-  initiated cache coherence, latency tolerance through
              buffered  writes, elimination of false-sharing, and efficient support for 
              synchronization via the caches.  The architectural features are  designed to be
              compatible with an interconnection network.         Research issues include: 
              Compile-time and runtime issues in  the exploration of the weak memory model
              and the architectural  features, novel simulation techniques for the evaluation
              of such  complex parallel systems, and exploration of optical  interconnects
              for such scalable architectures.
