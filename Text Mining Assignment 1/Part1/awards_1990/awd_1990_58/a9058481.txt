Abstract    :
              Dr. Gilbert Nathanson is supported by a Presidential Young                     
              Investigator Grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry                    
              Program to study atomic and molecular beam scattering from                     
              various low vapor pressure liquid substrates. Nathanson will be                
              studying the gas-liquid interface to learn, on an atomic scale,                
              about the roughness of liquid surfaces, about how various beam                 
              molecules adsorb, solvate or desorb and about the process of                   
              proton exchange on especially prepared surfaces.                               
                                                                                             
              Nathanson's scattering experiments will answer these questions                 
              by following the trajectories of the molecules as they strike                  
              the liquid surface. A highly collimated beam of atoms or                       
              molecules traveling at a selected velocity impinge on the                      
              surface and bounce off or react. The identity of the reaction                  
              product and its recoil velocity and direction are monitored by                 
              mass spectrometry. By carrying out microscopic,"single                         
              collision" experiments, Nathanson hopes to construct an                        
              intimate picture of how chemical reactions occur at the                        
              interface between gases and liquids.
