Abstract    :
              This a Presidential Young Investigator (PYI)                                   
              project which relates to electric power systems.                               
              The work deals with power system operation,                                    
              control, and efficient data processing.  The main                              
              thrust is the validation of a security assessment                              
              expert system for power system operations                                      
              control.  The system is already in prototype                                   
              form, and a detailed comparison of its                                         
              performance will be made in comparison with                                    
              human expert methods.  A second area of focus                                  
              relates to the use of the same or a similar                                    
              expert system for the purpose of corrective                                    
              strategy generation.  The function of this part of                             
              the expert system is the duplication of human                                  
              experts for the purpose of corrective strategy                                 
              dispatch of electric power systems.  Throughout                                
              the project, there will be emphasis on                                         
              man/machine interfaces and suitable paradigms                                  
              for engineering and scientific visualization of the                            
              on-line controls.
