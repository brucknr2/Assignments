Abstract    :
              Area of proposed research is in the design of composite columns,               
              where there remain fundamental questions regarding behavior and                
              detailing, particularly for slender columns and those with high                
              strength concrete.  Another potential topic involves the design and            
              behavior of steel or composite frames with concrete, masonry, or               
              composite infill walls.  This would involve research related to the            
              behavior of both individual wall elements, and entire structural               
              systems.  There are also outstanding questions stemming from                   
              Principal Investigator's previous research on composite beam-column            
              connections.  In particular, additional joint configurations should            
              be studied to develop a unified set of design guidelines having                
              more general applicability.  Finally, for these and other areas of             
              composite construction, the applicability and requirements for                 
              seismic design need to be established, particularly with regard to             
              special detailing considerations.
