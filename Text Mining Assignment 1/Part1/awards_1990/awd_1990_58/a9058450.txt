Abstract    :
              The connectionist paradigm provides the initial assumptions which              
              form the basis of this work on characterizing mechanisms of the                
              mind in terms of large networks of autonomous processing                       
              elements.  Specific aspects of this work include models of human               
              cognition, connectionist AI, and connectionist lerning algorithms              
              in an interleaved fashion.  This work focuses specifically on                  
              attention which will be studied in perception and also in higher               
              levels of cognition.
