Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              As the recipient of a prestigous Presidential Young Investigator               
              award, Dr. Bruce T. Milne, University of New Mexico, plans to                  
              test further the application of fractal geometry to modeling the               
              complex distributions and interactions of species, resources,                  
              nutrients, and habitats.                                                       
                                                                                             
              During the early part of the award, he will complete preparation               
              of a co-authored book on new applications of fractal geometry in               
              landscapes, with emphasis on:  quintessential fractal approaches               
              that are readily modified for many purposes; fractal statistical               
              testing; renormalization theory that will allow apparently                     
              different landscapes to be understood in terms of critical                     
              phenomena which regulate the flows of species, disturbances, and               
              pollutants; and diffusion in fractal environments.                             
                                                                                             
              A second effort will be creation of the first fractal-based                    
              geographic information system (GIS).  Because such a fractal-                  
              based GIS would automatically provide the scales at which                      
              multivariate relationships occur, it would be an invaluable tool               
              for detecting ecological changes occurring at various scales for               
              different phenomena.  Such a system could motivate new field                   
              sampling and remote sensing techniques to accommodate the fractal              
              nature of natural patterns, and could allow the linking of multi-              
              temporal and multi-scale studies in a single system.
