Abstract    :
              This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Program.                
              Dr. Peter T. Lansbury, who is being designated a Presidential                  
              Young Investigator which will provide him support for his                      
              research for five years.  He will use the funds to study                       
              problems of enzyme mechanism, biosynthesis and protein                         
              structure.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The research will center around developing understanding of the                
              details of the molecular interactions which govern peptide                     
              folding.  This involves the development of novel solid-phase                   
              fragment coupling methodolgy to produce large quantities of the                
              target protein.  This will then permit conformational studies                  
              and the synthesis of specifically labeled protein to simplify                  
              analysis by Fourier-transform spectroscopy and two dimensional                 
              nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  These techniques will                
              be applied to study polysaccharide protein interactions.
