Abstract    :
              Dr. David Coker is supported by a Presidential Young                           
              Investigator Grant from the Theoretical and Computational                      
              Chemistry Program to develop computationally tractable                         
              descriptions of many body potential surfaces which can                         
              accurately describe bond breakage and formation.  These                        
              theoretical potential energy surfaces are important in                         
              furthering our understanding of chemical reactions at the                      
              molecular level of detail.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Coker plans to exploit the isomorphism between the path                        
              integral formulation for the many electon exchange problem, and                
              the grand partition function describing the classical                          
              association equilibrium between cyclic polymer molecules as a                  
              method for dealing with correlated motions of molecular valence                
              electrons.  Coker proposes the use of several novel weighting                  
              techniques to circumvent the known phase problems associated                   
              with this methodology in treating antisymmetric many electron                  
              wavefunctions.  The long term goal of this research is the                     
              calculation of many body potential energy surfaces which allow                 
              the electronic distribution to vary dynamically with the                       
              nuclear motion, and therefore provide a high level of accuracy                 
              currently missing from most approches to molecular dynamic                     
              simulations of chemically reacting systems.
