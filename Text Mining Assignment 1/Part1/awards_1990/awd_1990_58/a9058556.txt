Abstract    :
              This is a PYI application from an Acting Assistant                             
              Professor of Electrical Engineering.  Dr. Nishimura                            
              received his Ph.D. from Stanford in 1985, and has been at                      
              Stanford since then.  He has numerous publications in the                      
              area of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.  His goal is                       
              to develop new ways of acquiring and processing signals                        
              in order to achieve improved imaging.  He will                                 
              concentrate on imaging flow, a vitally important area                          
              both scientifically and clinically.
