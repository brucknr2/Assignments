Abstract    :
                  The goal of this research is to develop a computer-aided design            
              system that can create hybrids of existing designs, or stated more             
              accurately, can interpolate between existing designs.  We see                  
              evidence of interpolation in many designed artifacts.  "Mountain               
              bikes,"  for example, result from an interpolation of off-road                 
              motorcycles and standard road bicycles.  While still fundamentally             
              a bicycle, motorcycle features like raised handlebars and knobby               
              tires dramatically alter the functionality.  Pedal-assisted mopeds,            
              on the other hand, are more toward the motorcycle end of the                   
              spectrum.  To create a CAD system with such capabilities, the                  
              interpolation operations will be formalized, a sufficiently limited            
              experimental design domain will be chosen, adequate                            
              representations that facilitate the operations will be determined,             
              and a system implementation will be developed.
