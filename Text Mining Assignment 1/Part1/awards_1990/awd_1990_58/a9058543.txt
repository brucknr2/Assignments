Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              To develop a deeper understanding of how cracks grow in brittle                
              materials this research examines the role of microstructural                   
              constituents in affecting crack instability.  Fracture toughness,              
              crack velocity, and high strain rate measurements are combined                 
              with systematic variations in the size, shape and distribution                 
              of microstructural constituents.  Model materials and commercial               
              materials are employed in the study with emphasis on metal-matrix              
              materials with a controlled size distribution of brittle, second-              
              phase precipitates or dispersoids.  A predictive model for                     
              fracture toughness as a function of particle strength, size and                
              distribution should result.
