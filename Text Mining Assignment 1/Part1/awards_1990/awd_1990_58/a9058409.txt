Abstract    :
              Lee         This research addresses some key requirements for the design  for
              manufacture of very small supercomputers used in intelligent  machines such as
              portable robots.  This multidisciplinary effort  is centered on developing a
              compact rapid prototyping and  manufacturing center.  Microscale laser
              lithography, flip-chip  soldering and robot controlled pick-and-place
              techniques are  being used.  Simulation studies validate the design before 
              prototyping.         Research is concentrating on the self-aligning mechanism 
              with an emphasis on the reliability of solder joints, fuzzy logic  modeling
              with focus on the process modeling and optimization, and  further improvement
              of thermosonic bonding technology.
