Abstract    :
              Dr. Craig Martens is supported by a Presidential Young                         
              Investigator Grant from the Theoretical and Computational                      
              Chemistry Program to study vibrational dynamics and energy                     
              transfer in many-body chemical systems.  Martens will develop                  
              computer simulation techniques which are important for a more                  
              fundamental molecular dynamical interpretation of chemical                     
              reactions.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Martens will apply molecular dynamics approaches to chemical                   
              systems ranging in complexity from isolated polyatomic                         
              molecules and clusters to complex condensed phases such as                     
              molecular liquids.  He will study ultrafast vibrational energy                 
              transfer and relaxation in such systems which can be strongly                  
              nonstatistical, involving special degrees of freedom and                       
              favored pathways.   Martens plans to employ a powerful new                     
              mathematical tool known as "phase space reconstruction" to                     
              extract collective modes of many-body systems from numerical                   
              experiments.  This technique will allow him to detect,                         
              characterize, and visualize relevant many-body collective                      
              coordinates.
