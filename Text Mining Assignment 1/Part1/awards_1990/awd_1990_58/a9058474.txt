Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in Elementary Particle                       
              Physics by Dr. Peter T. Timbie, a Presidential Young                           
              Investigator, Brown University.  The aim of the research is to                 
              develop and employ new types of sensitive cryogenic detectors                  
              of infrared and microwave background radiation, the relic from                 
              the Big Bang.  This radiation tells us the temperature and                     
              distribution of matter in the early phase of the universe.                     
              Both bolometer detectors cooled at very low temperature and                    
              superconducting tunnel junction will be used to build a small                  
              array for the observation of this microwave background                         
              radiation.  These detectors will also be used to detect                        
              particles that interact only weakly with matter, such as the                   
              particle which may form the "dark matter" of the universe or                   
              neutrinos.
