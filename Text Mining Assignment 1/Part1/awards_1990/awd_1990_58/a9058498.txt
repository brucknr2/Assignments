Abstract    :
              Three topics will be pursued with the aid of the Presidential                  
              Young Investigator award.  1. Nonlinear optical spectroscopy                   
              will be used to investigate the properties of solid-solid                      
              interfaces.  The sum-frequency signal generated by shining two                 
              beams of light onto a heterojunction (e.g., nickel                             
              silicide/silicon) is to be measured in order to probe the                      
              interfacial electronic structure.  2. A new technique in                       
              dynamical light scatteirng (diffusing wave spectroscopy) will be               
              employed to study particle motion and the transport of light in                
              dense colloidal suspensions.  3. Processes associated with                     
              adsorbed molecules on clean metal surfaces (e.g., cobalt and                   
              platinum), such as energy transfer, dephasing, and molecular                   
              movements, are to be investigated by ultrafast infrared                        
              spectroscopic methods.
