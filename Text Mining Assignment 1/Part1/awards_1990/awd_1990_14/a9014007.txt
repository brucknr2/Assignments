Abstract    :
                   This award enables Vassar College to connect to NSFNET through            
              a 19,200 bit per second link to NSFNET through the mid-level                   
              network NYSERNet.  Access to NSFNET provides the faculty and                   
              students with access to supercomputers, data archives, a variety of            
              network gateways, automated library catalogs, and a wide range of              
              software.  Primary applications include file transfers, electronic             
              mail communication between local and remote researchers, and remote            
              login to and use of supercomputers and other research facilities.
