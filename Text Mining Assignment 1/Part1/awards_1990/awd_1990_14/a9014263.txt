Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a two year collaborative project between                               
              Alan H. Strahler of Boston University and scientists                           
              from three institutes of the Chinese Academy of                                
              Sciences:  the Institute of Remote Sensing                                     
              Application in Beijing; the Institute of Optics and                            
              Fine Mechanics in Changchun, Jilin Province; and                               
              the Jilin Institute of Geography and its Jingyuetan                            
              Remote Sensing Experimental Site in Changchun.  The                            
              project is sponsored by NSF and the Chinese Academy                            
              of Sciences.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The proposed study will develop models that will                               
              enable remotely sensed images of forest and crop                               
              canopies to be measured and evaluated more                                     
              effectively.  The modeling activities will be                                  
              conducted in the United States and the radiometric                             
              measurements made in China at the Jingyuetan site.                             
              The net effect of the proposed research will be to                             
              test an important class of models for the interaction                          
              of plant canopies with light that emphasizes the                               
              geometric, three.dimensional nature of the canopy.                             
              The expertise and equipment available at the                                   
              Jingyuetan site provide a unique opportunity to                                
              validate these canopy models, which have been under                            
              development during the past several years.  If they                            
              prove sufficiently accurate, these models could                                
              supplement or supplant other models in ecosystem                               
              studies, agricultural monitoring activities, and                               
              remote sensing applications.
