Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is the investigation, using                
              instrumented aircraft, of the existence, structure, and                        
              evaluation of large super cooled water drops in stratus clouds                 
              which are the thought to be necessary ingredients for aircraft                 
              icing, a principle objective of the WISP experiment in Colorado.               
              In addition, selected snow bands will be investigated by the same              
              aircraft in Colorado.  The aircraft measurements will be                       
              complemented by a variety of remote sensing devices-doppler                    
              radars, microwave radiometers, profilers-operated by NOAA.
