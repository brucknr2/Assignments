Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Computational Mathematics Programs of the University                       
              of Puerto Rico in Rio Piedras and Mayaguez has had a                           
              tremendous research upsurge in recent times.  For example,                     
              the Rio Piedras Mathematics Department has moved from                          
              being in 1984 in the last position in number of                                
              publications per researcher of all the Departments of the                      
              Faculty of Natural Sciences in Rio Piedras, to being in                        
              1988 in the second position of all Science Department of                       
              the campuses of the University of Puerto Rico in such                          
              number of publication.  Also the Research Funds have                           
              increased 13 times from $100,000 for the period 1974-84 to                     
              $1,300,000 for the period 1984-1989.  Further a new BA in                      
              Computer Science has been approved by the academic senate                      
              to be included as one of the options we offer.                                 
                                                                                             
              The main objective of the present proposal is to further                       
              raise the competitive level of our Department through a                        
              program of collaborative research with highly competitive                      
              mainland researchers.  On the other hand we intend to                          
              increase minority participation in research through a                          
              local collaborative program of research with our four year                     
              colleges.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Last, the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras and                           
              Mayaguez Campus, will expand the Mathematics Graduate                          
              Program to include a joint doctorate in Computational                          
              Mathematics.  It will carry this out via a collection of                       
              coopering institutions, from the local to the national                         
              level.  With the cooperative assistance of national                            
              research institutions, this program will train faculty and                     
              professionals to serve the needs of local and national                         
              colleges and industry, and will greatly expand their                           
              growth potential in Puerto Rico along new lines.
