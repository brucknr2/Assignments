Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Bartlett will organize a very                
              timely workshop on coupled cluster theory.  The NSF funds will                 
              specifically be used to allow graduate students and                            
              postdoctorals to participate.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This workshop will be organized so as to encourage                             
              participation of chemists and physicists who work at the                       
              interface of atomic physics and quantum chemistry.  The impetus                
              for the workshop is to promote communication among the various                 
              groups who are contributing to the development of coupled                      
              cluster theory and to identify what formal and methodological                  
              developments are required in coupled cluster theory to make it                 
              more applicable to essential problems.  Among the topics to be                 
              discussed are parity violation in atoms, continuum problems,                   
              and Rydberg states.
