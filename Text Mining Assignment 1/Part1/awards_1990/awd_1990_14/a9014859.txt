Abstract    :
                   This work will generalize the "vector coherent state"                     
              theory to construct representations of arbitrary operators.                    
              Applications will be made to test the Fermion Dynamic Symmetry                 
              Model in the Actinide region of nuclei and an attempt will be                  
              made to construct the full U(n) Wigner-Racah calculus.
