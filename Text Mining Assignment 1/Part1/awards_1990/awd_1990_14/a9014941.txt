Abstract    :
              Professor William Jorgensen is supported by a grant from the                   
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              theoretical studies of organic chemical reactions both in the                  
              gas phase and in solution using a combination of quantum                       
              mechanics, statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics                        
              simulations.  The results of this theoretical research provide                 
              an important interpretation of chemical reactivity at the                      
              fundamental molecular level of understanding.                                  
                                                                                             
              Jorgensen employs ab initio molecular orbital calculations to                  
              provide energy surfaces for reactions in the gas phase and                     
              potential functions that describe solute-solvent interactions.                 
              The effect of solvation is then determined by computing the                    
              free energy surfaces in solution.  This involves Monte Carlo or                
              molecular dynamics simulations for the reacting systems plus                   
              about 300 solvent molecules in a periodic cell.  Finally, the                  
              reaction dynamics are studied by trajectory calculations that                  
              are started in the transition state regions.    These                          
              computations provide detailed information on key issues                        
              including the reaction mechanisms in the gas phase and in                      
              solution, the existence of intermediates, the origin of solvent                
              induced activation barriers, changes in solvation along                        
              reaction paths, energy redistribution during reactions, and the                
              dynamic role of the solvent in determining reaction kinetics.
