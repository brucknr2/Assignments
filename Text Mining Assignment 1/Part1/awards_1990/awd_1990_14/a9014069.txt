Abstract    :
              This award is to support rare-earth                                            
              doping of semiconductors for the                                               
              possibility of realizing novel types                                           
              of optoelectronic devices and                                                  
              sources.  The wavelength of the                                                
              rare-earth related 4f emissions                                                
              practically does not depend on the                                             
              bandgap energy of the host crystal                                             
              and is immune to temperature                                                   
              variations.  However, the gain of                                              
              the lasers is not high and the rare-                                           
              earth doping and excitation process                                            
              is not clearly understood.  We                                                 
              propose a systematic investigation                                             
              of GaAs and InP-based semiconductors                                           
              - mainly GaAs and InGaAsP - doped                                              
              during MBE by Er and by implantation                                           
              of Yb.  The experiments will include                                           
              time-resolved luminescence with both                                           
              resonant and non-resonant                                                      
              excitation, conductance and                                                    
              admittance spectroscopy to                                                     
              characterize deep levels, low and                                              
              high field transport and reflectance                                           
              measurements.  It is expected that                                             
              these experiments will improve the                                             
              basic understanding of the doping                                              
              process, changes in the material                                               
              radiative and non-radiative                                                    
              properties, and the temporal                                                   
              characteristics of the rare-earth                                              
              related transitions.  The latter are                                           
              particularly important for the                                                 
              design of high-speed pulsed lasers.                                            
              The PI also proposes the use of                                                
              rare-earth doped materials in a                                                
              couple of novel laser structures.                                              
              In the first the active medium is a                                            
              selectively doped MQW with narrow                                              
              rare-earth doped wells.  In the                                                
              second, a cascade of avalanching                                               
              carriers is made to resonate with                                              
              the rare-earth transition energy,                                              
              thereby causing a large non-                                                   
              equilibrium distribution through                                               
              collision excitation.
