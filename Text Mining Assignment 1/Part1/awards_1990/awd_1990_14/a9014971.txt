Abstract    :
              This award will support a joint U.S.-Australia workshop                        
              "The Nature of Embryonic Signals Which Influence the                           
              Maternal Endocrine System; 1-3 July 1991 in Honolulu,                          
              Hawaii. The U.S. and Australian organizers of the                              
              workshop are Dr. Fuller Bazer of the University of                             
              Florida and Dr. Robert J. Fairclough, Animal Research                          
              Institute, Werribee, Victoria, Australia. The principal                        
              objective of the workshop is to review published and                           
              unpublished results of research from 1989-1991 indicating                      
              major and important breakthroughs in understanding of                          
              the implantation process of embryos and the nature and                         
              mode of action of conceptus signals responsible for                            
              implantation and establishment of pregnancy in several                         
              mammalian species.  The major discussion will focus on                         
              early pregnancy factors, including platelet activating                         
              factor (PAF) and conceptus interferons, their mechanism(s)                     
              of action, their endocrine control and their effects                           
              during early pregnancy in both livestock and women.  It                        
              is anticipated that this knowledge will ultimately lead                        
              to new methods for reducing embryonic mortality in                             
              animal agriculture and increasing fertility in both                            
              livestock and women.  The scope of the meeting will be                         
              limited to factors affecting establishment of pregnancy                        
              during the peri-implantation period.  Because of                               
              significant activities in this area of research by                             
              scientists in Australia and the United States, the seminar                     
              will provide a forum for the exchange of published and                         
              unpublished results, as well as for establishing areas for                     
              future U.S.-Australian cooperative research.
