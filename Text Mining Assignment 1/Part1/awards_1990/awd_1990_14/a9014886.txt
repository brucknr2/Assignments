Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This renewal proposal is aimed at a structural study of suspended              
              thin-films of thermotropic liquid crystals exhibiting a variety of             
              phases intermediate between isotropic liquid and crystalline solid.            
              The transition from two- to three-dimensional behavior will be                 
              studied in films ranging in thickness from two to tens-of-thousands            
              of molecules.  The study will include an investigation of                      
              interfacial structure in microemulsions, and the transition of some            
              phases to the long range order of lyotropic liquid crystalline                 
              phases.
