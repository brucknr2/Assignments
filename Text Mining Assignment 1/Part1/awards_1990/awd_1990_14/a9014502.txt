Abstract    :
              This grant is jointly funded by the Polymer Program in the Division            
              of Materials Research and the Organic Synthesis Program in the                 
              Division of Chemistry.  Heteroarm star polymers containing x arms              
              of monomer A and n-x arms of monomer B should exhibit unusual                  
              segregation and interphase phenomena.  Living linking reactions                
              will be used to synthesize A2B2 star polymers composed of                      
              polystyrene and polydiene arms, and a new general                              
              fluorescent-labeling chemistry will be utilized to attach                      
              pyrene, anthracene, and naphthalene groups at the termini of the               
              arms.  A series of heteroarm star copolymers with well-defined                 
              structures will be used to explore their unique dynamic and                    
              equilibrium properties in the solid state, in the melt, and in                 
              solution.  The consequences of interarm interactions in isolated               
              heteroarm stars will be assessed from the rates and equilibrium for            
              macrocyclization, as deduced from excimer emission by molecules in             
              which two arms bear pyrene or naphthalene groups at their free                 
              ends.  Discrimination between the various types of interarm                    
              interactions that can occur in semidilute solution, melts, and in              
              the solid state will be determined with heteroarm stars selectively            
              labeled for the study of excimer emission or the rate of Forster               
              transfer.  The dynamics of isolated heteroarm stars, and their                 
              diffusion in concentrated solutions and melts, will be determined              
              using pulsed-gradient spin-echo NMR.
