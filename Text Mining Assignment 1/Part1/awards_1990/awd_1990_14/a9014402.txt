Abstract    :
              Rohrer         A piecewise linear circuit timing simulator that is robust  and
              efficient in the approximate transient analysis of lumped  circuits is being
              developed.  To better simulate the highly  nonlinear bipolar and biMOS
              circuits, a simulation strategy to  work with piecewise linear rather than
              piecewise constant table  approximations of nonlinear device characteristics is
              being  explored.  Inductance is being included on an equal basis with 
              capacitance.         The steady state solution computation is being made more 
              efficient by solving for its conditions explicitly, prior to  seeking the
              transient response that may attain it.  Thus, circuit  simulation is to be
              invoked only to obtain successive steady  state conditions, but not for
              intermediate transient time points.   To maintain transient simulation
              computational efficiency,  explicit integration strategies that allow the
              exploitation of  both temporal and spatial latency are being used.  To insure
              the  stability of explicit integration approximations, the computed  steady
              state conditions are being employed to limit step size.   This is intended to
              overcome the stiff systems problem.         The above strategies are being
              embodied in the SPECS  (Simulation Program for Electronic Circuits and Systems)
               software.
