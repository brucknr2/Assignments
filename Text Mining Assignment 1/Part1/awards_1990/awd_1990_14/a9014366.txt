Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The statistical mechanics and dynamics of disordered systems will              
              be investigated using analytical and numerical methods.  Three                 
              major areas will be studied:  1)  Self-avoiding walks in random                
              environments, 2) The superfluid transition for Helium in porous                
              media and 3) Random resistor and elastic networks.  These topics               
              will be investigated by a variety of modern methods of                         
              statistical mechanics; including field theory and the                          
              renormalization group, Lifshitz type arguments, and numerical                  
              simulation.  This research is directly relevant to understanding               
              current experiments in the areas of superfluids in porous glasses              
              and polymers in gels.  A second fundamental objective of this                  
              work is to advance the development of theoretical tools for the                
              study of disordered systems.
