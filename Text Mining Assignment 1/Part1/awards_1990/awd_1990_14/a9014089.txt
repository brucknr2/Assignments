Abstract    :
              Scientists from developing countries will be supported to participate in       
              scientific activities of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change         
              (IPCC) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United           
              Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).  These scientists will work with         
              colleagues from the United States and other industrialized countries           
              under the aegis of the IPCC, particularly its Working Group I, to review       
              the state of climate change with emphasis on a full-scale and                  
              scientifically valid assessment of climate change, that is, an assess-         
              ment of such change on the global scale.  This assessment is intended to       
              provide valuable input to the Second World Climate Conference later this       
              year, as well as to the development of a broad range of international          
              and national global change research programs.  Activities to be                
              supported will include scientific planning meetings and workshops.
