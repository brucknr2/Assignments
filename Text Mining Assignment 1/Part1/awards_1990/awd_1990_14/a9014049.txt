Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The proposed three year project will contribute to the                         
              long term research programs of both Hampton University                         
              (HU) and NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service, Northeast                     
              Fisheries Center (NEC), in zooplankton taxonomy and larval                     
              fish trophodynamics and to their shared commitment to                          
              increasing the participation of minorities in marine                           
              science.  Copepod developmental stages that are the                            
              preferred food of larval fish will be identified and                           
              enumerated in fine mesh (.053 mm pore size) spring                             
              zooplankton samples taken in 1980-83 in the Georges Bank                       
              and Gulf of Maine nursery areas for cod and haddock.  One                      
              HU graduate student will focus on 75 Georges Bank samples                      
              during project years one and two, and a second will                            
              utilize 91 Gulf of Maine samples during years two and                          
              three.  They and undergraduate student assistants will                         
              interact with scientists in the Plankton Ecology                               
              Investigation at the NEC Narragansett Laboratory.  The                         
              graduate students will develop masters theses that apply                       
              statistical analyses to new data from the fine mesh                            
              samples and existing data from coarse mesh samples to test                     
              hypotheses concerning the relative spatial and temporal                        
              distributions of zooplankton and ichthyoplankton in the                        
              study area.  Estimation of secondary production of copepod                     
              nauplii, employing production/biomass ratios or cohort                         
              analyses, will be attempted.  The fine mesh data will be                       
              added to the MARMAP Ecosystem Data Base at NEC, and the                        
              students will be advanced in their preparation for marine                      
              science careers.
