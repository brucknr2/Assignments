Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a U.S.-Australian workshop "Early                      
              Steps In The Flowering Process" to be held at the East-West                    
              Center, Honolulu, Hawaii on February 10-15, 1991.  The                         
              organizers are Dr. Carl McDaniel, Department of Biology,                       
              Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Dr. Rod W. King, Senior                   
              Principal Research Scientist, Commonwealth Science and                         
              Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Plant Industry,                       
              Canberra, Australia.  The workshop will bring together U.S.                    
              and Australian experts who represent the full range of                         
              research on flowering, that is, the reductionist, molecular                    
              genetic approach and the physical, whole plant approach.                       
                                                                                             
              The workshop will contribute to improved understanding of                      
              seed plants, the most important modern-day group of organisms                  
              in terms of energy capture and agriculture.  Collaborative                     
              interaction between Australian and American scientists is                      
              expected to be strengthened by exploring areas where future                    
              cooperative research may be beneficial.
