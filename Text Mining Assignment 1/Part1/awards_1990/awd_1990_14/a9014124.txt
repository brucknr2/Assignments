Abstract    :
              A new reconstitutable emulsion system was identified in                        
              laboratory, which is formed by addition of an aqueous vehicle                  
              to a finely divided solid.  The emulsion does not contain                      
              emulsifiers or other surfactant materials.  It is formed by                    
              dissolving saccharides or a hydrophilic polymer in a volatile                  
              solvent and the mixture is flash evaporated under vacuum until                 
              a dry solid is formed.  The addition of water to the dry solid                 
              forms a dispersed system having unique properties.  The new                    
              systems may be formed with strong acidic, alkaline or                          
              alcoholic solutions, is thixotropic, and the particle size                     
              decreases with time for about two weeks.  The objective of                     
              this research is to establish the thermodynamic properties of                  
              the new emulsion obtained in laboratory.  The research may                     
              lead to a new group of emulsion systems with application in                    
              pharmaceuticals, food and chemical industries.
