Abstract    :
              Within the past few years it has become increasingly                           
              common for electrical and optical systems to involve                           
              signals that vary on time scales of a few picoseconds                          
              or less, and the development of techniques which can                           
              reliably and economically produce, model, and                                  
              measure such pulses is a matter of considerable                                
              practical importance.  In spite of this activity,                              
              however, the majority of short pulse optical systems                           
              are still only partially and qualitatively understood,                         
              and the laser literature contains numerous                                     
              experimental observations which have not yet been                              
              interpreted.  The purpose of the theoretical and                               
              experimental studies in our proposed research is to                            
              develop a more rigorous understanding of the                                   
              dynamical behavior of short pulse laser systems.  The                          
              specific systems to be studied include dye lasers,                             
              which are the most common sources for picosecond                               
              pulses.  In addition, dynamical models will be                                 
              developed for the commercially important but                                   
              incompletely characterized semiconductor diode                                 
              lasers.  The increased insight resulting from this                             
              program will lead to more efficient and reliable                               
              sources of short optical pulses, means for eliminating                         
              those pulses when they are undesirable, and perhaps                            
              to pulses with characteristics that are not now                                
              available.
