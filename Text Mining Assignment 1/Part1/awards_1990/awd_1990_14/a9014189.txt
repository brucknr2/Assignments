Abstract    :
              Techniques for handling non-stationarity in signals and images have            
              been explored in different areas; wavelet analysis in applied                  
              mathematics, multi-rate filter bank techniques in digital signal               
              processing and multi-resolution analysis in computer vision.                   
              Recent developments have indicated the connection between these                
              various techniques.  A goal of this work is to make a thorough                 
              exploration of the connections between these three areas and                   
              present a unified view of existing problems, techniques and                    
              applications.  Further, design of new regular wavelets, examination            
              of associated computational structures and a study of the                      
              complexity of the wavelet transform are also pursued.  Finally,                
              design of non-separable multi-dimensional wavelets, new wavelet-               
              based-sampling methods and application to image coding are                     
              attempted.
