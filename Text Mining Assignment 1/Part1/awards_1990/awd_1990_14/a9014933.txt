Abstract    :
                   The primary goal of the proposed research is to understand                
              and quantify the sensitivity of tropospheric chemical processes                
              to dynamic and chemical processes occurring in clouds.  The PI                 
              will employ satellite derived cloud data to more accurately                    
              specify cloud properties within a comprehensive tropospheric                   
              chemistry model, conduct a series of sensitivity studies to                    
              quantify the influence of clouds on concentrations and chemical                
              production rates of various    species investigate the                         
              uncertainties in tropospheric chemical processes associated with               
              uncertainties in cloud processes, and evaluate and improve our                 
              ability to diagnose cloud cover using mesoscale meteorology data               
              assimilation systems.
