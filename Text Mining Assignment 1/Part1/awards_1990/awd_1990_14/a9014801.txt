Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Two expeditions to the Peru Continental Margin will investigate                
              biogeo chemical processes near the sediment surface.  The                      
              P.I:'s will measure the fluxes of biogenic components across                   
              the sediment-water interface linked to bacterial mat activity,                 
              organic matter diagenesis, iron redox cycling, phosphate                       
              precipitation and sedimentary denitrification.  The selected                   
              study area (11o40"S - 15oS; 50 m -600 m) exhibits high                         
              persistent upwelling, primary production and sediment organic                  
              carbon; ubiquitous microbial mats; modern phosphorites; and                    
              near-zero oxygen and "nitrate deficit" in the near-bottom water                
              column.  A smaller are (1300 sq. Km at 13o30'S), selected to                   
              study benthic processes will be box cored in a bottom-navigated                
              array to provide a detailed map for submersible operations and                 
              bottom experiments.  Fluxes will be obtained with benthic flux                 
              chambers (Landers), microelectrodes (Profilers) and mm-scale                   
              pore water profiles (box cores and Whole-Core Squeezer).  The                  
              P.I:'s will also deploy near-bottom sediment traps and current                 
              meters to determine transport velocities and directions and the                
              biogeochemical sources of particles entrained in the poleward                  
              bottom flow.  Both long- and short- term in situ experiments on                
              the seabed will test theories concerning (1) apatite nucleation                
              and solubility; (2) sediment disturbance and sediment                          
              starvation; (3) patchy distributions of laminated sediments,                   
              mats, organic carbon and pellets; and (4) Fe- and O2-redox                     
              driven phosphorus reaction.
