Abstract    :
                   The Eocene period of earth history was warmer and had lower               
              pole-to-equator thermal gradients than today. Preliminary                      
              modeling results suggest that the only way to achieve this type                
              of climate is with greater CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere                
              and with higher poleward heat transport.  Thus this interval in                
              earth history may provide important constraints on the effects of              
              future CO2 increases in the atmosphere.  This proposal requests                
              support to constrain the effects of higher CO2 and heat transport              
              on this climate using sophisticated General Circulation Model                  
              experiments and new paleoclimate data.   This research is                      
              important because it will help to isolate the effects of                       
              higher CO2 on climate, a topic which is very important for                     
              understanding the effects of fossil fuel CO2 on future climate.
