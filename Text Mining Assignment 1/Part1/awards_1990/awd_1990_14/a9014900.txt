Abstract    :
              Relativistic electron acceleration is a common characteristic of               
              many quasi-stellar objects and active galactic nuclei.                         
              Relativistic protons must be accelerated as well, but almost no                
              work has been done to investigate the limits on the abundance of               
              these particles, nor on the  consequences of their collision with              
              ambient gas.  This work, by a major partner in the University of               
              Minnesota's infrared astronomy effort, represents an exploration               
              of these questions, funded under NSF's Small Grants for                        
              Exploratory Research program.
