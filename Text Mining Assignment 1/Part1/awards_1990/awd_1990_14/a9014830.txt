Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study will investigate how people are                                     
              injured and die in earthquakes and other                                       
              disasters, how they are rescued, and how                                       
              medical care is provided to victims.  Field                                    
              research will be conducted at the site of                                      
              earthquakes and other natural disasters as                                     
              well as some technological disasters.                                          
              Particular attention will be given to                                          
              situations involving building and structural                                   
              collapse.  At each site data will be gathered                                  
              on: (1) damage to the built environment for                                    
              engineering analysis, (2) casualties, (3)                                      
              search and rescue activity, and (4) the                                        
              provision of emergency medical services.  The                                  
              results should prove useful to designers                                       
              working in areas subject to such                                               
              environmental risks as earthquakes, to                                         
              emergency medical officials confronted with                                    
              planning for mass casualties, and to                                           
              emergency managers involved in search and                                      
              rescue planning.
