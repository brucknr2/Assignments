Abstract    :
                   This work will carry out theoretical studies of electron                  
              collisions with molecular ions.  A variational method based on                 
              the complex Kohn formalism will be developed for scattering off                
              poly-atomic molecular ions, generalizing from successful work                  
              done for neutral molecules.  It will provide accurate cross                    
              sections calculations for processes which occur in low                         
              temperature plasmas.
