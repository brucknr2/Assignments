Abstract    :
              Intercellular communication is important in development.  Two genes            
              thought to be involved with cyclic AMP protein kinases in                      
              Drosophila will be studied.  Cyclic AMP is a common cell to cell               
              communicator.  The P element, an inserter and disrupter of gene                
              function, will be categorized by PCR and their effect on                       
              development studied.  Understanding how cells "know who and where              
              they are" is of fundamental importance to an understanding of the              
              genetic control of development.
