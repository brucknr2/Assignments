Abstract    :
              The 1990 International Workshop on Defect and Fault-Tolerance in               
              VLSI Systems is the 4th in a series of meetings which started with             
              the workshop in "Designing for Yield" held in Oxford in 1987.  The             
              workshop is held outside the U.S. every third year.  The 1990                  
              meeting is being held in Grenoble, France.  It is co-sponsored by              
              the IEEE Technical Committees on Fault-Tolerant Computing and on               
              VLSI and by the IFIP Working Group 10.5.  The meeting is an                    
              important forum for the dissemination of experimental data and                 
              analytical techniques for defect/fault control and tolerance for               
              the manufacture and design of VLSI/WSI systems.
