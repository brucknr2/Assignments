Abstract    :
              The quasi-permanent sea ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is a central             
              component of the northern high latitude climate system, and secular            
              changes in the concentration and thickness of the sea ice can be               
              important proxy indicators of wide-spread arctic climate                       
              variations.  While interannual differences in ice concentration and            
              extent are relatively easily documented from microwave satellite               
              imagery, variations in thickness require the analysis of direct in-            
              situ observations.  This project is an effort to analyze selected              
              sea ice draft profiles obtained with an upward looking sonar by                
              U.S. submarines while crossing the Arctic Ocean.  These data have              
              been obtained routinely since 1975, but have not yet been subjected            
              to a rigorous examination, nor have they been related to other in              
              situ and remotely sensed environmental data.  The proposed                     
              statistical techniques are expected to be sufficiently precise to              
              reveal interannual variations in the arctic ice thickness on the               
              decadal time scale, which may be an early indicator of hemispheric             
              climate change.
