Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will examine the phytoplankton population dynamics                
              at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series Station (BATS) and Station                 
              S, south of Bermuda using flow cytometric analysis. The                        
              structure of these communities influences the amount of net                    
              community production (new production) produced by the system,                  
              and thus it is important that we understand the factors that                   
              regulate them.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This work will be done as a part of the US JGOFS Time Series                   
              Study (monthly samples), and the Bermuda Biological Station's                  
              regular sampling program at Stations S (biweekly samples).                     
              Specifically, we propose to measure the abundance, light                       
              scatter properties (which reflect cell size and/or structure),                 
              and pigment autofluorescence of the following components of the                
              phytoplankton community:  the cyanobacteria - Synechococcus,                   
              prochlorophytes, eukaryotic ultraplankton, coccolithophores,                   
              pennate diatoms, cryptophytes, and the total remaining cells                   
              (except for those that are too rare to be caught in a 100 ml                   
              sample).                                                                       
                                                                                             
              These time series data sets will be interpreted in the context                 
              of the other physical, chemical, and biological parameters                     
              being measured at these stations.  They will help us:

                 structure in mid-latitude oligotrophic waters;                              
                                                                                             
              -  Determine the time scales of change in these communities;                   
                                                                                             
              -  Determine the spatial variability in population dynamics,                   
              and estimate the "island effect" at the BATS station and                       
              Station S;

              analyzed at these sites;

              -  Assess the feasibility and utility of collecting these types                
                 of data over very long time frames.
