Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is the development of a marine             
              boundary layer model, which includes turbulent exchange, radiation,            
              and teh micorphysical structure of low (stratocumulus) clouds, to              
              investigate the diurnal evolution of these clouds which form along             
              the coast of California.
