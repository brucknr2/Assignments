Abstract    :
                   The rule that every elementary particle must bear an                      
              electrical charge that is zero or an integral or rational                      
              fraction multiple of the charge e of the electron, rests solely                
              on experimental evidence.  The limits placed by experiment will                
              be extended to test this hypothesis.  Any deviation observed                   
              will require a major restructuring of theory.
