Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support for USA participants              
              in the 1990 Japan-USA Symposium on Flexible Automation.  The                   
              intent is to help defray approximately 50% of the expenses for                 
              attendance at the three-day meeting and for two days of arranged               
              tours of Japanese manufacturing firms.                                         
                   The objective of this trip is to learn about current                      
              academic and industry research in flexible automation.  This type              
              of close interaction between researchers in these two distant                  
              communities has, in the last two Symposia, proven to be quite                  
              beneficial, and with the increasing awareness of productivity                  
              problems in USA industries, such programs become more vital each               
              year.                                                                          
                   At the conclusion of the meeting, the USA organizers (a                   
              group of four to six) will travel to the National Science                      
              Foundation in the fall of 1990 to provide a one-day briefing on                
              the Symposium and related events.  Following that meeting, the                 
              group will submit a summary report.
