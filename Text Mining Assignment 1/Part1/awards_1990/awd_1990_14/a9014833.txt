Abstract    :
              This project is a continuation of a previously funded project on the           
              application of Kalman filtering to power system protective relaying.           
              The renewal addresses several different areas including the use of the         
              extended Kalman filtering (to accommodate nonlinear models), the               
              inclusion of fault security analysis, digital protection of power              
              system components with a minimum time methodology, identification of           
              the severity of system wide disturbances, and the computation                  
              (identification) of the fault location.  Included in the study are             
              series compensated lines, multi-terminal lines, high impedance faults,         
              transformer location, dynamic security assessment and evaluation, and          
              the use of vector signal processors in the implementation of the               
              Kalman filter.
