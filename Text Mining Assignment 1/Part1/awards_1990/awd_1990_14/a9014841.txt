Abstract    :
                   The ultimate objective of this research is to understand the              
              role of vertical transport of atmospheric trace gases by                       
              convective clouds.  This grant provides for the expanded analysis              
              of an extensive set of airborne observations of vertical profiles              
              of the tropospheric trace gases, nitric oxide, NOy, carbon                     
              monoxide, ozone, and non-methane hydrocarbons.
