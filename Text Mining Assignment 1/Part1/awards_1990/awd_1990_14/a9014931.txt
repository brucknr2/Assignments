Abstract    :
              This award supports the scientific exchange of personnel                       
              between the USSR Institute of Geography and the USA Ohio State                 
              University, Byrd Polar Research Center, (OSU-BPRC) for the  purpose            
              of designing a cooperative ice core paeloclimatology  research                 
              program.  The primary scientific goal for the                                  
              cooperative program is to extract high-resolution (annual) ice                 
              core records from one or two appropriate ice caps in the USSR.                 
              The chemical and physical characteristics of the atmosphere  are               
              preserved in these ice cores and contribute unique,                            
              otherwise unavailable, information about the                                   
              paleoenvironmental history of the Tibetan Plateau region,  The                 
              collaborative effort would encompass fieldwork, laboratory                     
              analyses, data reduction, synthesis, and publication.  This                    
              research is supported as a "Small Grant for Exploratory                        
              Research" (SGER) award.
