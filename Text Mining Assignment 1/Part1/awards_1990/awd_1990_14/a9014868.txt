Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to carry out an in-depth                
              analysis of multi-stage, multi-product production/inventory                    
              systems.  The research first focuses on the identification of                  
              effective manufacturing strategies and their investigation over an             
              array of performance measures.  The development of exact and                   
              approximate analytical models for these strategies and their                   
              incorporation into a queuing network based decomposition approach              
              constitutes the bulk of the effort in years two and three.                     
              Industrial collaboration is involved in all phases.                            
                   Models of production/inventory systems frequently arise in                
              design and performance studies of manufacturing systems.  Despite              
              their potential applicability, their use is not widespread.  This              
              is due mainly to the limited capability of existing tools for                  
              analyzing manufacturing systems.  The development of manufacturing             
              strategies for multi-product, multi-stage production/inventory                 
              systems should lay the groundwork for more comprehensive tools and             
              therefore greater applicability of analytical approaches to                    
              production system environments.
