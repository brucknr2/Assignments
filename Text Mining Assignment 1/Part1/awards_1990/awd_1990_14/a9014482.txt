Abstract    :
                   The problems addressed by this research project are in the                
              area of geometric topology.  Their common theme centers on                     
              automorphism groups of various kinds of spaces.  Primarily these               
              spaces are manifolds of various dimensions, but also addressed                 
              here are issues concerning more general kinds of spaces, such as               
              trees or complexes.  What kinds of groups can effectively act on               
              such spaces?  What does the space tell one about the group?  This              
              leads to focusing on the groups themselves, and how they                       
              decompose, or how they can act on other simple spaces, for                     
              example, trees.  It is worthwhile to understand the topology of                
              various possible classifying spaces for these groups, and what                 
              they look like at infinity.                                                    
                   In addition to the principal investigator, R. D. Edwards,                 
              two faculty associates, Mladen Bestvina and Geoffrey Mess, and                 
              two advanced graduate students are involved.  The work of all                  
              participants focuses on abstract spaces and the application of                 
              algebraic methods to their classification and understanding.                   
              There has been an enormous amount of activity in all of these                  
              areas in recent years, and there is much opportunity for further               
              progress.
