Abstract    :
                   This award enables Wellesley College to attach its campus-wide            
              network to NSFNET through a 56,000 bit per second line to NEARNET,             
              the New England Regional Network.  This connection allows                      
              Wellesley's researchers to login to supercomputers and other remote            
              comuters from their own networked office and lab computers so they             
              can access scientific statistical, linguistic and other specialized            
              data bases, special purpose software not available on computers at             
              Wellesley, and research library online catalogs.  These features               
              plus the high-speed file transfer capabilities of NSFNET                       
              facilitate collaboration between Wellesley faculty and their                   
              colleagues in colleges and research universities on the Internet.
