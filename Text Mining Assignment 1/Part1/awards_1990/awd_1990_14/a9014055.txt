Abstract    :
              This project will establish at Hampton University a multi-year                 
              Research Experience and Enrichment program for engineering,                    
              mathematics, and science students.  The aim is to attract                      
              students into research, train them, and channel them into graduate             
              programs at major research institutions upon graduating from college.          
              Within a period of five years, 40 students selected from the                   
              discipline areas of biological sciences, chemistry, engineering,               
              marine science, mathematics, and physics will participate in this              
              project.  Ongoing research programs at Hampton University will form            
              the framework upon which research activities for participating                 
              students will be based. The students who participate in this project           
              are provided financial support not only as incentive for pursuing              
              scientific research, but also to help reduce their financial burdens           
              and make graduate school a competitive career option after graduation.
