Abstract    :
                   The polar cap potential is a very important quantity in the               
              coupling between the solar wind and the magnetosphere.  It is a                
              quantity which gives a direct measurement of plasma flow in the                
              magnetosphere and can also be related to the energy input into                 
              this important region of the earth's geospace environment.  In                 
              the past, there have only been a few studies of the correlation                
              between the polar cap potential and the solar wind.  This grant                
              is for the following four tasks (1) assemble a large data set of               
              polar cap electric potentials from instruments on the two Dynamic              
              Explorer satellites, (2) determine how the solar wind and                      
              interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) control the polar cap                      
              potential, (3) investigate the relationship between the size of                
              the polar cap and the total potential drop, and (4) use AE                     
              indices in combination with the polar cap potential measurements               
              to find how the potential behaves during magnetospheric                        
              substorms.
