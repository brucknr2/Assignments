Abstract    :
                   This application for support for an annual series of                      
              conferences on "Controversies in Neuroscience" proposes to set up              
              debatable issues for each conference and to publish the results                
              in a journal which will publish both the main speakers' summary                
              of the issues and the discussants' comments.  If this formula is               
              succesful it will be a good format for settling issues and                     
              arriving at new directions for neuroscience.
