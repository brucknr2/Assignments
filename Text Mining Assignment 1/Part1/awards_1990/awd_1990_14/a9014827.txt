Abstract    :
              This is support for a workshop on "Advanced Motors and Drives" held            
              June 21,22, 1990 in Monterey, CA.  The workshop will be a forum for            
              university researchers to discuss the needs for work in rotating               
              electric machines and in power electronic drives.  It is expected that         
              the Electric Power Research Institute will also make a presentation of         
              their research goals and priorities.
