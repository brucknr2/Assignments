Abstract    :
              This research investigates the relation between the proportion of              
              luminous and dark matter in galaxies, and the environment of those             
              galaxies.  Both optical and 21 cm line spectra will be obtained                
              from galaxies in both relatively dense and sparse regions of space.            
              In additon to using the rotation curves thus obtained to study the             
              mass distribution in these objects, the average velocity measured              
              will be utilized to study peculiar motions of systems of relatively            
              nearby clusters of galaxies.
