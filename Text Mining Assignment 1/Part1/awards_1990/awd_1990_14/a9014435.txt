Abstract    :
              With this Minority Research Initiation Award, the Synthetic                    
              Organic Program will support the research of Dr. Augusto                       
              Rodriguez of the Department of Chemistry at Clark Atlanta                      
              University.  The objective of the work is to develop synthetic                 
              methods that will permit the isolation, characterization and                   
              study of vinyl peroxides.  Vinyl peroxides have been proposed                  
              as intermediates in several interesting reactions including the                
              chemiluminescence of luminol and the interaction of singlet                    
              oxygen with cumulenes.
