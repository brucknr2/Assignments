Abstract    :
                   This award enables John Carroll University to improve its                 
              connection to NSFNET by re-routing and upgrading its connection to             
              the mid-level network OARnet, the Ohio Academic Resources Network.             
              Improved access to NSFNET provides John Carroll faculty with                   
              increased opportunity for collaboration and use of a wide range of             
              research tools such as supercomputing and shared databases.                    
                   Because of a change in OARnet's network topology, John Carroll            
              is connecting to the SONIC (State of Ohio Network for Integrated               
              Communications) Point-of Presence tower in Cleveland.  They also               
              are changing their protocol to TCP/IP, which is used on OARnet,                
              NSFNET and the rest of the INTERNET.  To facilitate the expected               
              increased use of the network, the bandwidth of the data line from              
              the school to OARnet is being increased from 9,600 bits per second             
              to 56,000 bits per second.
