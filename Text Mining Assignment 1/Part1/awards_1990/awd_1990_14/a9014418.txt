Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project constitutes a portion of a large multi-                           
              investigator study examining the role of the entire                            
              heterotrophic community, from bacteria to large gelatinous                     
              zooplankton, in the recycling of primary production and its                    
              transport to depth in the  oligotrophic Sargasso Sea. The                      
              objectives of this specific project are to quantify the biomass                
              and consumption rates of the microzooplankton organisms in the                 
              size range of 20-200 um. A variety of methodologies will be                    
              employed. Profiling of the resident  populations will be made                  
              several times a day throughout the cruise. Different types of                  
              grazing experiments will be conducted in collaboration with                    
              other researchers on the various prey and predator groups. The                 
              project involves two major cruises to station S off Bermuda                    
              which constitutes the Atlantic time-series site for the JGOFS                  
              initiative. The cruises are scheduled for August 1989 and April                
              1990 to coincide with productivity minima and maxima,                          
              respectively. The systematic approach of this group project to                 
              describe and quantify the flux of primary production through                   
              the epipelagic food-web will provide critical data on how the                  
              composition of the zooplankton community affects the flux rate                 
              of organic material from the euphotic zone.
