Abstract    :
              The goal of this one year Small                                                
              Grant for Exploratory Research is to                                           
              explore the possibility of developing                                          
              a novel type of microwave detector,                                            
              based on quasi-one-dimensional                                                 
              conductors like TaS3 and K0.3Mo03                                              
              which exhibits metal to                                                        
              semiconductor transition around                                                
              200K.  In the low temperature phase the                                        
              compounds have nonlinear electrical                                            
              response at low electric fields due to                                         
              formation of charge density waves.                                             
              Recently, it has been discovered that                                          
              a novel type of non-linearity appears                                          
              in these compounds around liquid                                               
              helium temperatures.  The change                                               
              in the differential resistance is very                                         
              abrupt and large, and it would                                                 
              appear to offer excellent mixing

              electromagnetic waves.                                                         
              The principal investigators will                                               
              attempt to use the sharp nonlinearity                                          
              of the electrical response for the                                             
              detection of microwave signals in the                                          
              frequency range of 10GHz to                                                    
              100GHz.  They will explore the                                                 
              properties of the compounds in the                                             
              presence of combined DC and                                                    
              microwave electric fields.  If                                                 
              microwave detection proves to be                                               
              feasible, they will compare the                                                
              characteristics of these compounds                                             
              to that of established microwave                                               
              detectors.
