Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of the P3D software, a metafile storage format for                 
              general 3D models, is to provide a consistent form in which                    
              researchers can store, transmit, and exchange models resulting                 
              from their research.  The project involves creation of interfaces              
              to a number of different renderers so that images can be produced              
              on whatever hardware or software platforms are available.
