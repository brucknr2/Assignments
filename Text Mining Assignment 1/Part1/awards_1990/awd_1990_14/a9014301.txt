Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two areas which need further enhancement in the parallel computing             
              effort of the National Center for Supercomputer Applications are the           
              creation of a balanced hardware environment that will facilitate               
              greater user access and system throughput, and consulting support for          
              the migration of users to the newly acquired Connection Machine.   This        
              award will provide hardware to increase the communication bandwith, and        
              also allow a greater number of users to access the machine.  It also           
              provides for staff/consultants who can assist users.
