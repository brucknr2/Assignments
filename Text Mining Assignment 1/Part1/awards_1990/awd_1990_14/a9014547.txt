Abstract    :
                   An experimental investigation of the quantum dynamical                    
              processes for two-state atoms strongly coupled to an optical                   
              cavity is to be undertaken.  The objectives of the research are                
              to explore the spectroscopy of the atom-cavity system as a                     
              reflection of underlying quantum structure, to record the photon               
              statistics as a probe of quantum state reduction and quantum                   
              coherence for an open quantum system, to observe the response of               
              the atom-cavity system when driven by squeezed light to study                  
              fundamental modifications of radiative processes for coupling to               
              phase-sensitive reservoirs, to make measurements of quantum                    
              switching and of new quantum phase transitions for an                          
              understanding of global quantum coherence in a dissipative                     
              setting, and to generate squeezed light by the normal modes of                 
              the coupled atom-cavity system for the resolution of previous                  
              discrepancies and for spectroscopic applications.
