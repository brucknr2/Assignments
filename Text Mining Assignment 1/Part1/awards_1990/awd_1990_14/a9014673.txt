Abstract    :
              This project will provide for the additional printing and distribution         
              of a National Academy of Engineering brochure,  "Engineering and Human         
              Welfare: 10 Outstanding Achievements, 1964-1989".  Since engineering           
              is not included in the curriculum of most secondary schools, students          
              at that level have little exposure to the scope and excitement of the          
              engineering disciplines.  Extensive distribution of this brochure can          
              be a very cost-effective way of creating interest in engineering at            
              earlier age.  This, in turn, can have a positive effect toward                 
              increasing the number of students in the engineering pipeline.
