Abstract    :
                   This project will attempt to quantify the influence of                    
              temperature, precipitation, slope gradient and azimuth on the                  
              nature, rate and products of weathering of granitic rocks.  The                
              dependent variables examined are the change in modal mineralogy                
              and bulk chemistry when the parent rock disintegrates to sand-                 
              sized material, and the survivability of mineral-mineral                       
              interfaces in sand-sized rock fragments within the weathered                   
              grus.  The independent variables are mean annual precipitation,                
              mean annual temperature, temperature-weighted precipitation, and               
              the mean gradient and azimuth of the slopes on which weathering                
              takes place.                                                                   
                   Five lithologically identical plutons in diverse climatic                 
              settings have been chosen for study, which allow the pair-wise                 
              comparison of weathering settings in which four of the 5                       
              independent variables can be held constant, while the fifth                    
              attains high and low values in the two members of the pair.  The               
              analysis of interface survival encompasses stereologic analytic                
              methods that have never been applied to sedimentary petrography                
              before and a new conceptual framework for viewing the rock                     
              fragment population of sands.                                                  
                   Potential exists for the development of lithological                      
              indicators of past climatic change.
