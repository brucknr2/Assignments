Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Our research aims at a comprehensive study of analytical                       
              and numerical procedures for obtaining algorithms for                          
              solving a system of random algebraic equations, random                         
              differential equations and random integro-differential                         
              equations.  These methods will be applied to specific                          
              models in science and engineering.
