Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Advanced analytical procedures to predict                                      
              earthquake response of arch dams have been                                     
              developed based on various assumptions that                                    
              have not been verified experimentally.  While                                  
              these numerical models include the reservoir                                   
              interaction and the water compressibility                                      
              effects, they also are sensitive to reservoir                                  
              geometry and the reservoir bottom reflection                                   
              coefficient.  A cooperative research project                                   
              with Chinese researchers is proposed under                                     
              this project to: a) investigate reservoir                                      
              interaction effects on arch dams, b) conduct                                   
              field measurements on a large arch dam in                                      
              China, and c) make quantitative evaluation of                                  
              analytical procedures by comparing the                                         
              measured and calculated results.                                               
                                                                                             
              The reflection coefficient of the absorptive                                   
              reservoir bottom and the actual topography of                                  
              the reservoir, which are required as input in                                  
              analytical predictions, are to be determined                                   
              by field surveys.  Measurements will be made                                   
              to detect water compressibility and spatial                                    
              variation of ground motion near the dam-                                       
              foundation contact.  This excitation                                           
              technique is expected to produce larger                                        
              hydrodynamic pressures and better information                                  
              regarding the dynamic interaction between the                                  
              dam and its foundation than has been obtained                                  
              previously using eccentric-mass shakers.  The                                  
              measured dam response, foundation response,                                    
              and the hydrodynamic pressures will be                                         
              compared with analytical predictions using                                     
              the best current mathematical procedures to                                    
              validate the accuracy of the analytical                                        
              techniques.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The final product of the research program                                      
              will be specific testing procedures to                                         
              measure absorptive coefficient of the                                          
              reservoir bottom, measured dam-foundation and                                  
              reservoir response behavior, and the                                           
              associated analytical predictions which will                                   
              be useful for design purposes.
