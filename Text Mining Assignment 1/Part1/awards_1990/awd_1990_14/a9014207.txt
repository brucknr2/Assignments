Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Single crystal and powder X-ray crystallography is the most                    
              powerful analytical method for structure determination of                      
              solids.  In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and                     
              organometallic chemistry, single crystal X-ray diffraction is                  
              an invaluable tool to characterize molecular structure, whereas                
              powder diffraction determines purity.  The information gained                  
              from the knowledge of the intermolecular composition and                       
              structure helps to develop new reactions of potentially general                
              interest in catalysis or organic synthesis.                                    
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                   
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the Iowa State                        
              University acquire a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer and a                 
              powder diffraction system.  Among the areas of chemical                        
              research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the
