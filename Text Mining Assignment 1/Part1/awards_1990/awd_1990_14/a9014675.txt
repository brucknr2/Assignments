Abstract    :
                   Birkeland in 1908 was the first to introduce the famous                   
              terrella experiment which simulated some of the features of the                
              magnetosphere in a controlled laboratory environment.  Utilizing               
              electron beams, this first terrella experiment supported his                   
              auroral investigations.  This grant is for terrella experiments                
              of the following studies:  1) global structures of the earth's                 
              magnetotail, 2) large scale field-aligned polar currents, and 3)               
              temporal variations of fields with an emphasis on fluctuations.                
              An intense spherical dipole field will be used as a model earth.               
              A high density cold plasma injected from inside the sphere will                
              surround the model earth, simulating the ionosphere.  This model               
              earth will then be exposed to a moderate density magnetized                    
              plasma beam produced by a large plasma gun, simulating the solar               
              wind.  To achieve the proposed objectives, various computer-aided              
              diagnostics for particles, fields, currents, and waves will be                 
              used to obtain and analyze the comprehensive data.
