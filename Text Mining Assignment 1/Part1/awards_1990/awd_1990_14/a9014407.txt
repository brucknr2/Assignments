Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support for the                           
              publication of the proceedings of the 4th International                        
              Accelerator School; Hilton Head Island; South Carolina;                        
              November 7-14, 1990.  The school is jointly organized by the                   
              U.S. Particle Accelerator School, office at Fermilab and the                   
              CERN Accelerator School, headquartered at CERN; Switzerland.                   
              The school will be hosted by the Southeastern Universities                     
              Research Association, Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator                     
              Facility.  The 4th International School in the series of                       
              "Frontiers of Particle Beams," will be on the subject of "Beam                 
              Intensity Limitations," a very important concept which has to                  
              be taken into account in the design of a given particle                        
              accelerator facility.  The school provides a source of current                 
              knowledge on particle accelerators and helps build up particle                 
              accelerator expertise as well as fosters international                         
              collaboration on accelerator education.  The school is intended                
              for individuals with professional interests in accelerator                     
              physics and technology, for graduate students, for post                        
              doctoral research scientists and for those working in                          
              accelerator-based sciences.
