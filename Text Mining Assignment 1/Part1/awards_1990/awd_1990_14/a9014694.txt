Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research award will support an anthropology                  
              graduate student in the Indian Himalayas to study the socio-                   
              economic implications of male out-migration on indigenous gender               
              perceptions.  Women in the local society often manage domestic as              
              well as agricultural work since their husbands are away.                       
              Traditional views on the sexual division of labor will be                      
              analyzed.  Methods used include structured and informal                        
              interviews, censuses, cognitive analyses and time allocation                   
              studies in a context of an extensive period of participant                     
              observation.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This research is important because male labor migration occurs in              
              most regions of the world, and understanding how the absence of                
              males affects the behavior and understanding of women's places in              
              society can help us understand how to stimulate economic                       
              development in the local areas.
