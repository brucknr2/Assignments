Abstract    :
                   The "1990 Summer Study on High Energy Physics Research                    
              Directions for the Decade"  was held in Snowmass, Colorado;                    
              June 25 - July 13, 1990.  The Division of Particles and Fields                 
              of the American Physical Society organized the study and about                 
              520 participants attended.  This action will provide funds for                 
              publication of the proceedings and post conferences expenses.                  
              This study followed four highly successful summer studies held                 
              at Snowmass, Colorado, in 1982, 1984, 1986 and 1988.  The 1990                 
              summer study included physics at existing and anticipated                      
              hadron-hadron, e+e- and ep colliders; physics at fixed target                  
              energies; the physics potential of possible new facilities,                    
              such as B factories; non accelerator based physics; accelerator                
              and detector initiatives; and the physics and technical                        
              ingredients of the initial SSC experimental program.
