Abstract    :
              Professor Kleppa is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                  
              and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division                  
              and the Metallurgy, Ceramics and Electronics Materials Program                 
              of the Division of Materials Research to perform high                          
              temperature calorimetric measurements on refractory materials.                 
              This research will provide data which are critically important                 
              in the design of new high temperature composites and other high                
              temperature materials.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Professor Kleppa will study the high temperature calorimetry of                
              alloys involving transition metals which form intermetallic                    
              compounds with particular emphasis on compounds of early                       
              transition metals with late transition metals.  He will also                   
              begin a new research program involving the thermochemistry of                  
              transition metal phosphides.  The experimental technique used                  
              in obtaining these data is known as solute-solvent drop                        
              calorimetry, and Kleppa plans to extend the utility of the                     
              technique to temperatures above 1400K.
