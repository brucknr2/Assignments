Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Near threshold scattering is a very important problem in                       
              quantum collision theory.  The LFCC method, although                           
              accurate, is not applicable to all but simplest molecules                      
              (e.g. H2).  The AN theory, on the other hand, seems to                         
              breakdown near threshold.  We have devised a First-Order                       
              Non-Degenerate Adiabatic (FONDA) theory which is not as                        
              demanding as LFCC method but is more accurate than AN                          
              theory near threshold.  The FONDA theory has been applied                      
              to H2 molecule, with model and separable exchange, and the                     
              results are very encouraging.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The first phase of this proposal would be to improve the                       
              FONDA cross section for vibrational excitations of H2 near                     
              threshold by including more vibrational states of the                          
              target molecule in the construction of the K matrix.                           
              Reformulation the FONDA theory in terms of the T matrix                        
              boundary conditions will also be considered.  The second                       
              phase is to implement direct exchange in the FONDA theory.                     
              Finally in the last phase of this project, this theory                         
              will be applied to N2 molecule.
