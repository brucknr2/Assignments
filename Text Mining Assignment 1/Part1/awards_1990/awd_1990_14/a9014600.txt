Abstract    :
                   This research is devoted to an observational study of the                 
              microphysical, kinematic and electrical structure of warm-based                
              convective clouds in Central Florida as part of the convection                 
              and Precipitation/Electrification (CAPE) experiment.                           
              Investigations include multiple-Doppler synthesis of winds,                    
              polarization radar (CP-2) data, aircraft data, and a variety of                
              in-situ and surface-based electrical measurements.  Modeling                   
              studies include calculation of propagation/scattering using                    
              polarimetric measurements for a variety of hydrometeors.  Adding               
              a "radar" module to the CSU Regional Atmospheric Modeling System               
              (RAMS) is proposed based on a new microphysical module currently               
              being developed by Dr. Cotton's group.  The latter will focus on               
              identification of the "optimum" mix of polarimetric/dual-                      
              frequency radar signatures useful for cloud electrification,                   
              hydrometeor classification, and storm evolution studies.
