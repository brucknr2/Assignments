Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In response to a request from the Director of the Office                       
              of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the National                          
              Research Council (NRC) will conduct a review of the research                   
              plan for the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP),                     
              including an assessment of a number of scientific issues                       
              relating to the role of the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS)                  
              in the USGCRP. The review will be conducted under the aegis of                 
              the NRC's Committee on Global Change (CGC), with the assistance                
              of several other NRC units concerned with earth, life, and                     
              space sciences.  The review will use two closely coordinated                   
              panels of the CGC.  One will review the USGCRP as a whole, and                 
              the second will address specific issues singled out in the                     
              OSTP request relating to EOS in the context of the USGCRP.                     
              Preliminary results of the review will be transmitted to OSTP                  
              by April 1, 1990, and the final report will be transmitted by                  
              July 1, 1990.
