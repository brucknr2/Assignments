Abstract    :
              This award will support the participation of ten U.S. researchers in           
              a joint seminar on "Enhanced Thermal Contact Conductance in                    
              Microelectronics," to be held in Melbourne, Australia, March 1992.             
              Dr. T. Nejat Veziroglu, Director of the Clean Energy Research                  
              Institute, University of Miami, will chair the seminar.  Co-                   
              chairpersons will be Dr. John W. Sheffield, University of Missouri-            
              Rolla, and Dr. Arthur Williams, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria,          
              Australia.  The seminar takes place under the U.S.-Australia                   
              Cooperative Science Program.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Thermal contact conductance plays an important role in many practical          
              applications where heat transfer is a significant operational                  
              factor.  Examples are to be found in microelectronic devices, rotating         
              machinery, cryogenic fluid containers, the fuel-cladding interface             
              in nuclear fission reactors, and aircraft structural joints subject            
              to aerodynamic heating.  For cooling microelectronic devices, most             
              research has been on improving active convective systems for                   
              removing heat, such as cooling jets and through-flow.  However, new            
              technologies developed for the application of thin films offer                 
              opportunities for utilizing thermal conductance as a means of                  
              transporting heat away from "hot spots" in electronic and other                
              systems.  U.S. and Australian scientists and engineers are among               
              those doing significant research in thermal contact conductance.               
              Participants at this seminar will share their research results in              
              this field, describe various novel surface preparation techniques              
              (such as metallic vapor deposition onto contact surfaces) to                   
              optimize surface heat transfer behavior, discuss applications to               
              microelectronics and other technological areas of industrial                   
              importance, and make recommendations regarding future cooperative              
              research activities that should prove mutually beneficial.  A one-             
              volume report of the proceedings will be prepared that will give               
              broader dissemination of the information presented at the seminar.
