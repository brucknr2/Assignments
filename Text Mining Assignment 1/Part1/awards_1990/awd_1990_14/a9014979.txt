Abstract    :
              This is an award to support exploratory research on a                          
              technique to identify and quantify viral content of                            
              environmental waters.  The technique is based on                               
              artificial synthesis of nucleic acid sequences that will                       
              be used as primers for a polymerase chain reaction that                        
              amplifies the nucleic acid chain of the target virus for                       
              identification and quantification.                                             
                                                                                             
              This proposal was submitted to NSF under conditions                            
              outlined in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory                            
              Research (SGER). The proposed research addresses                               
              limitations of current approaches for determining the                          
              quality of a water supply by use of surrogate parameters                       
              rather than by search and analysis for the target itself.
