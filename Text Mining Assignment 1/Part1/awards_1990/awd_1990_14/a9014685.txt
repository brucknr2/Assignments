Abstract    :
                   This award enables Reed College to attach to NSFNET through a             
              56,000 bit per second line to the NorthWestNet mid-level network.              
              Access to NSFNET provides Reed faculty with increased opportunity              
              for collaboration and improves their access to a wide range of                 
              research tools such as supercomputing and shared databases.                    
                   Reed has established a local area network linking faculty and             
              student workstations to a variety of local services including                  
              databases, compute servers, printer servers and reference                      
              materials.  This NSFNET connection helps meet a long-term goal of              
              the College, to provide access to remote services, by extending                
              this distributed computing environment to regional and national                
              supercomputing centers, library catalogs and reference materials of            
              other institutions, and remote database servers.
