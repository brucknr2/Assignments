Abstract    :
                   This research will consist of a rigorous systematic                       
              methodology for generating the initial topology or layout of                   
              structural members based on mathematical models and physical                   
              principles.  The new method of homogenization provides a new and               
              exciting approach for addressing rigorously how structural                     
              topologies may be optimized.  This fundamental new capability                  
              offers a unified scheme for carrying concept evolution through                 
              detail layout design, using rigorous principles together with                  
              appropriate empirical knowledge, so that realistic, manufacturable             
              shapes can be obtained.
