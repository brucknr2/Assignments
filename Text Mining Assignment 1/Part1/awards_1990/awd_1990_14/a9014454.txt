Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Membrane science and technology has become a rapidly growing                   
                                                                                             
              area in the 1980's fostering the creation of membrane-specific                 
                                                                                             
              organizations in Europe, Japan, and the US.  Membranes as a                    
                                                                                             
              still emerging area has a multitude of potential applications.                 
                                                                                             
              The key areas include sensors, encapsulations, and                             
              separations, among others which are crucial to many                            
              industries.  The US participation in the Congress is,                          
              therefore, of vital national interest.  In such a fast moving                  
              area, it is important to bring together scientists and                         
              engineers in a coherent meeting which has an international                     
              point-of-view.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The International Congress on Membranes and Membrane Processes                 
                                                                                             
              (ICOM) is the premier forum for this important area.  The                      
              initial congress meeting was held in Europe in 1984 and a                      
              second in Tokyo in 1987.  The Third congress is planned for                    
                                                                                             
              Chicago, August 20-24, 1990.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This third congress is sponsored by the North American                         
              Membrane Society (NAMS).  Co-sponsors are the European Society                 
                                                                                             
              of Membrane Science and Technology and the Membrane Society of                 
                                                                                             
              Japan.  At present it is expected to have 57 technical                         
              sessions, 2 posted paper sessions, and 1 plenary lecture                       
              session.  The total number of papers to be presented will be                   
                                                                                             
              about 500, making this the largest membrane meeting ever held.
