Abstract    :
              The third Gordon Conference in the series, "Protons and                        
              Membrane Reactions", will bring together investigators                         
              concerned with proton-mediated energy transduction in a large                  
              variety of biological systems.  Emphasis will be on mechanisms                 
              of proton movement and transfer in lipid bilayers and proteins.                
              This is intended to be a work-shop style meeting with about 100                
              participants.
