Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                     
              Annmarie Surprenant of the Oregon Health Sciences University                   
              and Dr. Timothy O. Neild of Monash University, Australia. In                   
              the vascular systems of the body (blood and lymphatic) it is                   
              the smallest muscular vessels that play the greatest role in                   
              physiological regulation.  It has been extremely difficult                     
              in the past to make quantitative studies of the behavior of                    
              these vessels because they are too small to allow the                          
              attachment of mechanical devices to measure their contractions.                
              It is possible to measure their movement by computer imaging                   
              but this approach had not been exploited because of the high                   
              cost of the equipment and the lack of suitable software.                       
              Computer image processing equipment is no longer prohibitively                 
              expensive and Dr. Surprenant's research team has developed a                   
              simple but novel algorithm for the measurement of small                        
              vessel diameter in real time.  In an existing grant to Dr.                     
              Suprenant from the National Science Foundation, she is                         
              developing the software required for video-tracking of                         
              microvessels.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              In this project, U.S.-standard video, image processing and                     
              computer hardware will be brought to Dr. Neild's laboratory                    
              to determine the combination of hardware and software to use                   
              in designing new systems based on a video tracking software                    
              program to monitor the diameter of arterioles embedded in                      
              connective tissue, developed in Dr. Neild's laboratory. The                    
              overall objective of the project is to develop systems that                    
              will be compatible and available in both countries.
