Abstract    :
                This grant will fund urgently needed support through the SGER                
              program to cover analysis and interpretation of the 1988 and 1990              
              sequences of earthquakes in the Upland, California, area.  The                 
              second sequence was very rich in aftershocks and almost large                  
              enough to trigger a TIP (time of increased probability) in the                 
              Keilis-Borok earthquake prediction algorithm.  Because the Los                 
              Angeles basin is in an episode of enhanced earthquake activity                 
              since March 1986 as comparaed to the time period 1952-1985, it is              
              important to analyze these sequences in a timely manner.  Because              
              both small and large earthquakes are more likely during times of               
              increased earthquake activity, this research has some urgency                  
              interms of mitigating earthquake hazards in the urban areas of                 
              Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties.  This work has direct                 
              application to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
