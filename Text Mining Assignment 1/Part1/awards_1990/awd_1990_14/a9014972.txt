Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project provides partial support for Dr.                    
              Amiya Sen to spend three months as a guest scientist at the                    
              Institute of Plasma Research (IPR) in Ahmadabad, India.                        
              During that period he will be conducting theoretical                           
              physics and mathematical modeling research on the control                      
              of disruptions in the ADITYA Tokamak at the IPR.  The                          
              concept to be investigated is the use of active feedback of                    
              the instability leading to the disruption.  Two possible                       
              schemes will be examined, a helical coil suppressor, and a                     
              modulated neutral beam suppressor.  The Indian team, headed                    
              by Dr. A. Sen of the IPR, will design and carry out the                        
              experiments for this research which are expected to                            
              continue for a much longer period after the visit of the                       
              U.S. scientist.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This cooperative research between the U.S.                             
              scientist and his Indian counterpart should be beneficial                      
              to the two countries.  The U.S. P.I. has made a short visit                    
              to the IPR last year to discuss arrangements for the                           
              proposed research.  As a result an official invitation was                     
              issued by the IPR for him to spend his sabbatical leave                        
              there.  That invitataion has been approved by The                              
              Government of India.  This project meets the U.S.-India                        
              Cooperative Science Program criteria.
