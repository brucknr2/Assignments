Abstract    :
              The security of an electric power system is automatically and                  
              periodically evaluated every few minutes by control center computers.          
              Two main deficiencies with the present analyses are the targets of             
              this project.  The index used to measure the severity of a possible            
              disturbance is the extent of the violations for the post-contingency           
              steady state conditions.  The research in this project is to improve           
              this index by including the correctability of these violations.  The           
              present analysis assumes that the post-contingency steady state is             
              reached without dynamic instabilities.  In this work, the                      
              instabilities will be detected and corrected.  A main feature of the           
              project is the use of parallel computation to speed up these                   
              calculations -- especially the detection of the instabilities.
