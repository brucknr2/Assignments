Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this research is to perform a systematic study             
              of drawing-augmented hydrostatic extrusion for the production of               
              ultrafine wire from soft materials on an existing unit.  The                   
              program will include:  (A) Stability optimization of the 63,000                
              pound per square inch laboratory unit for augmented hydrostatic                
              extrusion of ultrafine wires; (B) Upper-bound analysis of the                  
              process including hydrodynamic lubrication effects; (C)                        
              Demonstration of unit capabilities for extruding ultrafine                     
              aluminum, aluminum-silicon, and gold wire and for cladding of                  
              ceramic super-conductor wires, including experimental studies to               
              determine the effects of reduction ratios, die angles, speed,                  
              potential lubrication/pressure media and other variables on the                
              process.                                                                       
                   The combination of both the experimental and analytical work              
              is fundamental to the program.  The analysis will improve the                  
              understanding of the process, while the experimental phase will                
              demonstrate the utility of new information and improved process                
              capability.  The complete program will provide a definition of the             
              capabilities and limitations of augmented hydrostatic extrusion for            
              the production of ultrafine wire.  This research will extend the               
              upper limits on speed and reduction through the development of the             
              understanding of the process.  This understanding will lead to the             
              development of algorithms for the control system, as well as to its            
              implementation.
