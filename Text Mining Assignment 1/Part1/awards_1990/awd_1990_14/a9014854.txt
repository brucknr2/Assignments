Abstract    :
              This tectonic evolution of West Antarctica and its                             
              relationship to East Antarctica is the most fundamental                        
              tectonic problem of the Antarctic continent.  It bears on                      
              global plate interaction, paleocirculation in the Southern                     
              Ocean, paleoenvironment, and paleobiogeography as well as                      
              being critical to the development of the continent itself.                     
                                                                                             
              The joint United States-United Kingdom West Antarctic                          
              Tectonics Project (1983-88) has shed considerable light on                     
              the tectonic evolution of the Wessell Sea Region.  This                        
              award supports a new tripartite United States-New Zealand-                     
              United Kingdom program of study in Marie Byrd Land for the                     
              years 1990-93 to complete our understanding of the tectonic                    
              evolution of Marie Byrd Land crustal block and craton, New                     
              Zealand and the Pacific Ocean basin.  This study is the                        
              major U.S. contribution to the program and involves                            
              structural, paleomagnetic, petrologic, and geochronologic                      
              investigations bearing particularly on the pre-Cenozoic                        
              development of Marie Byrd Land.
