Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the fatigue life and dynamic                     
              load supporting capacity of simple and continuous                              
              prestressed concrete girders with various size openings                        
              through the girder.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The results will be of benefit for industrial buildings                        
              supporting machinery of all types.
