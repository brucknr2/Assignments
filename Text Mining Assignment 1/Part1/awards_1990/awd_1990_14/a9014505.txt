Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The primary purpose of these initial studies is to                             
              demonstrate that total internal reflection infrared                            
              techniques are highly sensitive and useful in the study of                     
              surface adsorbed metal carbonyl compounds.  These studies                      
              will also form a background for the proposed research by                       
              aiding in the understanding of the infrared spectra of                         
              Cr(CO)6 on Al2O3 surfaces.  The interactions of Cr(CO)6                        
              with the surface and with other Cr(CO)6 molecules can be                       
              determined, and the structure of the surface adsorbed                          
              molecule can be elucidated. The investigator will spend                        
              this planning period preparing a research proposal that                        
              will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed                               
              experimental techniques, and the ability for these                             
              experiments to be carried out at a primarily                                   
              undergraduate institution. A significant portion of the                        
              time will be utilized obtaining preliminary data.  The                         
              infrared absorption spectrum of Cr(CO)6 adsorbed on Al2O3                      
              single crystal surfaces will be measured as a function of                      
              surface coverage.  These measurements will demonstrate the                     
              viability of the proposed research as well as the                              
              capability of the institution.
