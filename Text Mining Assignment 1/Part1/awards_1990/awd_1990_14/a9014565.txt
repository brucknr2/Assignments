Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to explore the macroscopic,                       
              microscopic, and molecular aspect of fracture in polymers and                  
              polymeric matrix composites.  Particular emphasis will be placed               
              on defining the synergistic effects of stress and aggressive                   
              environmental agents on mechanical properties of highly oriented,              
              ultra high strength polymeric fibers.  The bond rupture events                 
              will be monitored with Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) technique                 
              during the fiber tensile tests.  These experiments will provide                
              information on molecular changes resulting from stress/ageing,                 
              the number of chains that need to be broken to accomplish final                
              failure, and insight into the molecular mechanisms active during               
              sample failure.  The ESR technique will also be used to study                  
              failure of fiber composites.  The ESR spectra will yield                       
              information on the stress distribution and its relation to the                 
              failure of fibers in the composite.
