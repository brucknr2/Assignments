Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports a cultural anthropologist study of the                   
              social symbolic function of the carnival in southern Spain.  This              
              anti-establishment, anti-clerical, pre-Lenten festival was                     
              traditionally analyzed as a "ritual of rebellion" against the                  
              state.  The project will compare the current carnival with the                 
              PI's 1977 study of a carnival in this place.  By studying the                  
              changes as a "pre-test - post-test" design the project will                    
              attempt to see how the amelioration of the political repression                
              of the Franco regime is manifested in the current carnival.  The               
              project hypothesizes that the anti-establishment theme of earlier              
              carnivals will have declined.  Methods include participant-                    
              observation, textual analysis of songs, and in-depth interviews                
              with local poets and political officials.                                      
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the dramatic changes in                     
              European political regimes, in the direction of easing                         
              repression, have effects on people's symbolic expressions that                 
              must be understood.  This ethnographic project will provide in-                
              depth information on one case, in Spain, that will be useful in                
              interpreting similar cases in Eastern Europe.
