Abstract    :
              This award supports cooperative research between                               
              Dr. Lynne Billard of the University of Georgia and                             
              Dr. Sukumar Chakraborty of the Australian CSIRO's                              
              Division of Tropical Crops and Pastures (St. Lucia,                            
              Queensland) on the interface between statistical                               
              analysis and plant growth.  Over a period of three                             
              years, the researchers will undertake mutual short-term                        
              visits to each other's laboratories.  The focus of the                         
              research is deterministic modelling of the progress of                         
              anthracnose disease in stylosanthes, a pasture crop                            
              grown both in Australia and in many parts of the United                        
              States, especially in the South.                                               
                                                                                             
              The researchers, using data collected in Australia,                            
              will investigate multivariate and regression models                            
              concerning the disease's spread in relation to other                           
              environmental variables, especially weather, for which                         
              data have been collected.  Adapting techniques devised                         
              to study diseases in humans, they will also                                    
              investigate the stochastic process related to disease                          
              spread.  The research may lead to better management and                        
              control of this disease in legumes.
