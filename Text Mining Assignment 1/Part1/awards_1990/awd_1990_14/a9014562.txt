Abstract    :
              This project continues the investigator's research, with two distinct          
              parts.  The first part is to explore the scope of the new low degree           
              polynomial techniques in simulation of complexity classes.  These              
              methods were invented very recently, with striking results:                    
              characterizations of the power of interactive proofs and multiprover           
              interactive proofs.  The new methods do not relativize, a fact with            
              potentially far reaching consequences in structural complexity theory.         
                                                                                             
              The second part is to further develop the algorithmic machinery that           
              put basic permutation group manipulation in NC and yielded an order of         
              magnitude improvement in sequential worst case asymptotic time                 
              complexity.  A striking feature of the new methods is the depth of             
              group theory required for their analysis.  Indeed, even for                    
              rudimentary tasks such as membership testing in permutation groups, a          
              number of consequences of the classification of finite simple groups           
              have to be invoked.
