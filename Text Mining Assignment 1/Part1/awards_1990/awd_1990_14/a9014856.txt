Abstract    :
                   The Association of Computer and Information Science and                   
              Engineering Departments at Minority Institutions (ADMI) was                    
              established at the 1989 NSF/CISE Workshop in New Orleans, Louisiana.           
              Support is being provided for the continued effort of making ADMI an           
              effective instrument to further the interest of minority institutions          
              and the National Science Foundation in strengthening computer                  
              science/engineering academic and research programs and increasing the          
              number of minority students selecting CISE supported areas as                  
              faculty/research careers.  Support is being provided during this               
              formative period of ADMI for meetings of the organization's elected            
              officers and Advisory Board, and other projects until strategies are           
              developed to provide long term self-sufficiency.  Immediate support is         
              for three board meetings, the 90 Annual National ADMI meeting, and             
              three proposal writing one-day workshops to be held in Baltimore, MD           
              (Morgan State University); Houston, TX (The University of Houston);            
              and Davis, CA (DQ University).
