Abstract    :
              The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                   
              Organometallic Chemistry Program is the chemistry of transition                
              metal cluster compounds, which constitute an important class of                
              industrial catalysts. The project is expected to provide a                     
              better understanding of the way in which such clusters are                     
              assembled and of the transformations of organic molecules bound                
              to the clusters.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Two important areas of metal cluster chemistry will be                         
              addressed: ligand transformations on clusters and the synthesis                
              of new types of mixed-metal clusters.  In the former area the                  
              recent finding of ways to split the C-O bond of the CCO ligand                 
              will be exploited. The mechanism of this reaction will be                      
              studied, and the cleavage of the C-O bond will be utilized to                  
              synthesize a variety of new substituted acetylide ligands bound                
              to three-metal clusters. These ligands will permit systematic                  
              studies of the very large substituent effects on C-C cleavage                  
              reactions for substituted acetylene ligands bound to metal                     
              clusters. Cluster building reactions based on the cleavage of                  
              the C-O bond should provide a new route to clusters containing                 
              C2 moieties. In the second area of metal cluster research, the                 
              synthesis and physical characterization of new types of early-                 
              late transition metal cluster compounds will be explored.
