Abstract    :
                   This action would commit continued funding for the                        
              Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) for the period 1 November,                
              1990 through 31 October, 1993.  The funds would be used to                     
              support the operation of the CESR facility for research in                     
              elementary particle physics (and for parasitic use for                         
              synchrotron radiation research), experimental physics research                 
              by Cornell faculty and staff at CESR, improvement of the                       
              capabilities of CESR to deliver more luminosity, operation of                  
              the computing facility at CESR, provision of a support                         
              environment for collaborators, and accelerator physics research                
              and development.  The staff includes 18 faculty, 22 Research                   
              Associates, 18 graduate students and 69 Technical Support                      
              personnel.  About 20 Cornell undergraduates (plus                              
              undergraduates from collaborating institutions) are associated                 
              with the project during the course of a year.
