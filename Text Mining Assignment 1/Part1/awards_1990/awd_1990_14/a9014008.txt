Abstract    :
                   A workshop on spatial and temporal aspects of ecological                  
              scaling as they relate to exchanges of water, carbon, and energy               
              in terrestrial ecosystems will be conducted at Snowbird, Utah from             
              December 2-5, 1990.  It will focus on scaling between leaf-level               
              ecophysiological processes, the whole plant, the community, the                
              ecosystem, and the globe.  Issues of scale dominate and constrain              
              the contributions of ecophysiology to global change research.  Yet             
              it is evident that ecophysiologists, whose primary interests lie               
              in mechanistic, process-level studies, have not adequately                     
              considered linkages between their disciplines and others interested            
              in the ramifications of these processes at broader geographical and            
              longer temporal scales.  This workshop will bring together                     
              ecophysiologists, ecologists, biometeorologists, ecosystem                     
              ecologists, and remote sensing specialists interested in the                   
              challenge of scaling to meet the critical need of linking process-             
              level and global scale interests.  In content and format, this                 
              workshop will be geared toward formulating the paradigms and                   
              facilitating the contacts necessary to establish the role of                   
              ecophysiology in the emerging field of earth system science.
