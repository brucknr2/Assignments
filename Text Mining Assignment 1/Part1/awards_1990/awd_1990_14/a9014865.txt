Abstract    :
              They propose to measure the linewidth of phonons in the lattice                
              phase of electrons on the surface of liquid helium to check the                
              weak coupling theory of longitudinal phonon linewidths.  This                  
              theory predicts the linewidths to vary inversely with the phonon               
              frequency, and predicts the density and temperature dependence of              
              the linewidth.  A maximum in the linewidth is predicted at about               
              one-tenth the melting temperature.  This results from a reduction              
              in scattering at high temperatures due to the Debye-Waller                     
              factor.  The weak coupling approximation is expected to hold for               
              densities below 107/cm.  Their measurements should check the                   
              range of validity of this theory.
