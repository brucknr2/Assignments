Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The 1990 Midwest Regional Developmental Biology Conference at                  
              Purdue University will provide an opportunity for established                  
              investigators, graduate students and postdoctoral students in the              
              midwest to meet in a congenial setting to exchange ideas, both                 
              informally and by presenting their most recent findings on the                 
              platform and by means of posters. A balance will be struck in the              
              platform and poster programs between presentations by senor and                
              by junior persons. Opportunities will be provided for graduate                 
              and postdoctoral students to present their own work, often for                 
              the first time, and to observe examples of excellence for them to              
              emulate. To ensure the latter, there will be an invited keynote                
              speaker for each of the four sessions (Sherri Brown, Plant                     
              Development; Don Ready, Cell Architecture and Development; Mark                
              Muskavitch, Genomic Control of Development; and David Stocum,                  
              Regeneration and Repair), as well as a keynote address by Carol                
              Erickson, who will describe her investigations of neural crest                 
              cell migration. There also will be scheduled visits to                         
              laboratories within the Department of Biological Sciences (those               
              of Robinson, Asai, Ready, and Vanable), to enable conferees to                 
              learn first hand the approaches taken by these investigators, and              
              to see some of the major techniques used in their labs. The                    
              extensive interaction among students, faculty, and invited                     
              speakers will promote the exchange of new information and an                   
              enthusiasm for teaching and research in developmental biology.
