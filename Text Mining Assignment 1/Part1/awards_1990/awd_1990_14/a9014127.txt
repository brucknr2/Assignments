Abstract    :
              The proposed research involves the development of faster and more              
              accurate analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog data converters.              
              The converters studied are of the interpolating type, which                    
              effectively trade conversion speed for accuracy.  That is, in                  
              interpolating type converters, the use of a multibit (rather than              
              a single-bit) front end in an interpolating converter can lead to              
              a higher resolution for a given speed or a higher conversion speed             
              for a fixed resolution.  However, a multibit front-end requires an             
              analog component accuracy which cannot be achieved without                     
              complicated and expensive trimming and or randomizing techniques.              
              A novel digital self-calibration and correction technique which                
              achieves the requisite accuracy of the multibit system without any             
              trimming or randomizing, using only a simple additional digital                
              stage is being developed in this research.  The work involves an               
              architectural study of the novel system, development of the circuit            
              blocks needed and design, fabrication and testing of several fully             
              integrated converters based on the novel principle.  This new                  
              approach should lead to faster and or more accurate converters than            
              any of the currently available ones.  Such converters will lead to             
              further developments in important applications such as digital                 
              radio and television, digital audio, ISDN, radar, etc.
