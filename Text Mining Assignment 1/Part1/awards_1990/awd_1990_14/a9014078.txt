Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Organic Dynamics Program in the                  
              Chemistry Division, Professor C. David Gutsche of the Chemistry                
              Department at Texas Christion University will investigate the                  
              "Mechanism, Scope, Limitations, and Applications of                            
              Phenol-Formaldehyde Reactions".  One of the goals of this                      
              project, is to determine the mechanism by which cyclic                         
              oligomers  and other products are formed in these reactions.                   
              These studies are also of importance in enhancing an                           
              understanding of the demulsifiers used in the oil industry.                    
                                                                                             
              This project will study the mechanism of formation of cyclic                   
              oligmers from the reactions of p-alkylphenols with methanal and                
              the interconversion of cyclic octamers to cyclic tetramers.                    
              Polymeric calixarenes and calixarenes imbedded in polymeric                    
              systems containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties                   
              will be investigated.
