Abstract    :
              Professor Nibler is supported by the Experimental Physical                     
              Chemistry Program in a continuing investigation of the                         
              properties of molecular clusters probed by nonlinear optical                   
              techniques.  The work spans the size range from dimers to much                 
              larger clusters and addresses issues ranging from dimer                        
              structure and spectroscopic properties to the study of                         
              nucleation, growth, and surface and bulk properties of larger                  
              condensates.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Large clusters of molecules, such as nitrogen, oxygen,                         
              hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and acetylene, are being probed by                   
              stimulated Raman scattering and coherent antistokes Raman                      
              scattering at various distances from the source nozzle of a                    
              free jet expansion.  Both vibrational and pure rotational                      
              spectra are being produced, yielding information on the                        
              evolution of the cluster expansion and the condensation                        
              processes occuring.  Work continues on Raman probing of dimers                 
              of nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen; these are important dimers                  
              whose centers of symmetry make them inaccessible                               
              spectroscopically except through use of Raman techniques.
