Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Structures of metals are examined at the atomic level, as                      
              follows: (1) reaction rates of diffusing point defects with                    
              complexes of probe atoms and point defects are studied to                      
              determine local lattice strains in metals; (2) Lattice sites of                
              probe atoms in nanoscale metal clusters with radii less than 100               
              nm are measured to characterize how the structures of clusters                 
              depend on their size; (3) High temperature ordered alloys are                  
              examined to find equilibrium point defects and diffusion                       
              mechanisms; (4) Phase transitions and defect structures are                    
              analyzed in shape memory alloys.  Perturbed angular correlation                
              measurements and Mossbauer spectroscopy are the primary                        
              experimental tools employed in the research.
