Abstract    :
              This research will study the temperature of the solar corona and               
              the density of solar chromospheric                                             
              spicules through observations of their continuous spectra carried              
              out at the total solar eclipse of the                                          
              Sun on July 11, 1991.  Accurate determinations of the intensities              
              of certain spectral lines can lead                                             
              to an independent determination of coronal electron temperatures.              
                                                                                             
              Total solar eclipses allow one to measure the solar emission as a              
              function of altitude above the solar                                           
              limb.  From this emission it is possible to deduce the temperature             
              and the density of the                                                         
              chromosphere.  The physical conditions that are deduced will be                
              useful for improving models for                                                
              small chromospheric structures.
