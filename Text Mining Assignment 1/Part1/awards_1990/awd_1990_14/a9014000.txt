Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many regions in the United States and the Soviet Union face                    
              earthquake threats.  Historically, both countries have had a                   
              number of devastating earthquakes, most recently the December                  
              1988 Armenian earthquake and the October 1989 Loma Prieta                      
              earthquake.  Much can be learned from US and Soviet scientists                 
              and engineers involved in evaluating the consequences of such                  
              events.  Post-disaster teams have visited each other's                         
              country and much valuable information has been exchanged.                      
              The objective of this workshop, is to extend and deepen this                   
              relationship and specifically to promote long-term cooperative                 
              research in this area.  Topics to be addressed in the workshop                 
              are ground mechanics (soil-structure interaction, liquefaction,                
              ground failures, and landslides and mudslides; development                     
              of new construction materials; development and validation of                   
              mathematical models; and development of methods for strengthen-                
              ing and retrofitting existing structures.                                      
                                                                                             
              The workshop is being organized jointly by the U.S. National                   
              Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the Academy of Sciences of the                   
              U.S.S.R. (ASUSSR).  The NAS participation is being managed by                  
              the NAS/National Research Council Committee on Earthquake                      
              Engineering and the delegation will be led by committee                        
              chairman George Housner of the California Institute of                         
              Technology.  The Soviet delegation will be chaired by Dr.                      
              V.N. Strakhov, Director of the ASUSSR Institute of the                         
              Physics of the Earth.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the                    
              United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary                        
              efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest                    
              and competence in the field of basic scientific research on                    
              the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
