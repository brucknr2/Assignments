Abstract    :
              The research proposes experiments on the electronic and optical                
              properties of high temperature superconducting compounds such as               
              strontium- and zinc-doped lanthanum cuprates.  The insulating side             
              of the metal-insulator transition will be studied to ascertain the             
              precursor properties ultimately leading to superconductivity for               
              large enough values of the doping.  Experimental techniques to be              
              employed include photoconductivity and photoluminescence, Hall                 
              effect and magnetoresistance measurements.  The overall objective              
              is to better characterize the semiconductor-to-metal transition as             
              the carrier density is increased.
