Abstract    :
                   A three year pilot project will be implemented that will                  
              focus on increasing the presence of minorities in computer                     
              science.  This will be done by developing and testing an                       
              information system to enhance both the recruitment of minorities               
              for computer science graduate programs and the interaction among               
              minorities already in computer science as graduate students or as              
              professionals.  The information system will be on-line and                     
              accessible to other universities via networks.  It will contain                
              data such as students' personal data, financial support                        
              mechanisms, contact persons, description of graduate program in                
              computer science, personal data will be obtained from a select                 
              group of colleges/universities, including CIC (Committee on                    
              Institutional Cooperation plus the University of Chicago), along               
              with 10 institutions with predominantly minority students.                     
              Faculty, counselors, administrators, and students from Michigan                
              State University will serve as a pilot group for the proposed                  
              system on a vax computer system and use the database, INGRESS.                 
              Also, workshops are planned in order to obtain feedback from the               
              project participants, including outside evaluators.
