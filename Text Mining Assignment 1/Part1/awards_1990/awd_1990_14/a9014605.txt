Abstract    :
              This project continues on ongoing study of the design and analysis of          
              sequential, parallel, and distributed algorithms.  The research will           
              include both attempts to develop new general tools and techniques as           
              well as solutions of specific problems in five areas:  algorithms on           
              strings, dynamic programming, problems on dynamic graphs, competitive          
              analysis of algorithms, and problems in cryptography.
