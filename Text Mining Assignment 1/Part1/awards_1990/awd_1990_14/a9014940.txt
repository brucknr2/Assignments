Abstract    :
              Hodges         This research is on systems for instruction in and control  of IC
              (integrated circuit) manufacturing (CIM).  There are two  parts:  1.     The
              user interface.  The primary thrust is developing  graphical user interfaces
              and multimedia applications to improve  manufacturing productivity and
              training.  These include a  standard desktop interface for control, scheduling,
              analysis and  management programs.  Also being developed is an engineer's 
              notebook, and a hypermedia introduction to semiconductor  manufacturing.  2.   
               Process control and development.  Research is focused on  designing and
              prototyping object-oriented systems to support  routine manufacturing
              applications at the equipment level.         Activities include:  real-time
              monitoring, statistical  process control, fault diagnosis, the efficient
              development of  new recipes, and the economical creation of equipment models.  
              Experiments with real-time monitoring of applications on  equipment (processing
              and analytical) and equipment maintenance  are being done.  Results are being
              used to create a  photolithography workcell prototype.
