Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project initiates cooperative research                                    
              between U.S. and Taiwan researchers in the                                     
              area of structural and geotechnical dynamics.                                  
              The joint study will be focused on three major                                 
              topic areas: (1) probabilistic modeling of                                     
              dynamic forces utilizing the current data base                                 
              of earthquakes, winds, floods, slides, etc.                                    
              recorded and accumulated in both countries,                                    
              (2) intelligent buildings - an emerging                                        
              research subject of significant impact                                         
              potential to future civil engineering                                          
              practice, and (3) field testing of                                             
              geotechnical-structure systems utilizing field                                 
              experimental facilities planned for advance                                    
              dynamic testings.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The research will be conducted at the National                                 
              Taiwan University through joint workshops and                                  
              field investigation.  The effort is expected                                   
              to synthesize the current knowledge and                                        
              practices, assess the future research needs,                                   
              and develop cooperative projects between the                                   
              two countries.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This action is jointly supported by three                                      
              programs at the Engineering Directorate:  the                                  
              Structural and Building Systems Program, the                                   
              Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Program and the                                   
              Natural and Manmade Hazard Mitigation Program.
