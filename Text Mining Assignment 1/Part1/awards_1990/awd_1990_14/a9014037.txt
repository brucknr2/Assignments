Abstract    :
              This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research.  Bacterial genes               
              for poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) will be transferred from the               
              bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus into the plant Arabidopsis                     
              thaliana.  It will then be possible to determine whether or not                
              these genes can be expressed in plants, and whether or not the                 
              PHB made is stable.  If these preliminary experiments are                      
              successful further experiments would be undertaken to maximize                 
              the concentration of PHB in the plant tissues.  PHB forms a                    
              biodegradable plastic and efficient expression in plants could                 
              lead to reducing its costs to practical levels.  These                         
              experiments could also help answer the question of why plants                  
              abandoned PHB as a storage compound in favor of starch and oils.
