Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Parallel, distributed memory supercomputers have proved capable                
              of very large gravitational N-body simulations.  In order to                   
              address further questions in cosmology and the large-scale                     
              structure of the Universe, new algorithms which can model the                  
              dissipative dynamics of gas, as well as dissipationless                        
              gravitational dynamics will be needed. This project will focus on              
              developing a parallel "Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics" (SBH) code,              
              and use it in an ongoing astrophysics collaboration studying the               
              formation of large-scale structure in the universe.  The                       
              applicability of parallel computers and large N-body simulations               
              to globular cluster evolution and an alternative to SPH, based                 
              on multigrid methods, for evolving the dissipative equations of                
              motion will be considered.  Finally, the applicability of new                  
              high-level software systems to particle methods in computational               
              astrophysics will be investigated.
