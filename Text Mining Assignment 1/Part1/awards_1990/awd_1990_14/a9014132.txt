Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal requests support for the Fourth Conference on               
              the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, to be held at the Univ.               
              of California at Irvine.  The participants at this conference                  
              will examine learning-induced changes in the nervous system. The               
              keynote speakers and participants include some of best known                   
              researchers in the field of learning and memory research.  In                  
              general, the proposal is of a high quality, novel, integrative                 
              and should promote research and critical analysis of ideas in                  
              this community.
