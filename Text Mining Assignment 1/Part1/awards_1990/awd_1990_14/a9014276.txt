Abstract    :
              9014276  Ketterson  We propose a Research Training Group in the inter 
              disciplinary  study of Animal Behavior. We are a collaborative group of 
              Biologists, Psychologists, and Neuroscientists concerned that the  study of
              behavior is being hampered by overspecialization. By  training students in
              multidisciplinary approaches to common  research problems, we can show the
              benefits of combining  evolutionary thinking and the analysis of mechanism in
              the study  of behavior. The primary component of our training will be the 
              opportunity to address research problems from several  perspectives and under
              the direction of more than one mentor. Our  theme, "Choice, Transitions, and
              Constraints," reflects the  importance we attach to (1) proximate assessment of
              the immediate  environment, (2) learning and development, and (3) evolution, in
               understanding behavior.    We request support for eight graduate students and
              two  postdoctoral students. These trainees will rotate through at  least two
              laboratories. Our research programs will include (1)  the Study of
              Communication, (2) Sexual Behavior and Mate Choice,  (3) Orientation and
              Migration, (4) Learning Mechanisms, Ecology,  and Behavioral Plasticity, and
              (5) Parental Behavior and  Ontogenetic Transitions. We will establish a Center
              for Animal  Behavior at Indiana University that will provide a setting to 
              promote our objective: the focussed, interdisciplinarv  investigation of animal
              behavior.  ***
