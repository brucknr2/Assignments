Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project on "Growth of Diamond and Cubic Boron Nitride Single              
              Crystalline Films" addresses experimental and theoretical aspects              
              of epitaxial crystal growth.  The homoepitaxial growth of diamond              
              films on different crystallographic surfaces of diamond substrates             
              will be studied using electron cyclotron resonance assisted                    
              molecular beam epitaxy.  The role of atomic hydrogen in stabilizing            
              certain surface reconstructions and in removing graphitic co-                  
              deposits will be investigated, as well as electron and ion assisted            
              growth and doping phenomena.  Transport, optical, and recombination            
              properties of the epitaxial films will be characterized.  Defects              
              will be studied by electron spin resonance, cathodoluminesence, and            
              Raman spectroscopy, and correlations between defect concentration              
              and growth rate will be investigated.  The results of these                    
              fundamental studies are of importance to the potential use of                  
              diamond and boron nitride in electronic applications with                      
              capabilities beyond silicon-based electronics enabling improved                
              device and circuit performance, and extending electronic/photonic              
              applications to new areas such as sensor and processor utilization             
              in the high temperature environments of automobile and jet engines,            
              and for process control in manufacturing.
