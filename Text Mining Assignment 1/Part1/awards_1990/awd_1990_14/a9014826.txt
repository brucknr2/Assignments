Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigators undertake research in the                     
              convergence of the random vortex method for solving the                        
              time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations.  They concentrate on time              
              discretization, dependence on viscosity, and flow in a half-plane.             
              In addition,they propose calculations of turbulent flow past a                 
              sphere.  Vortex methods are techniques for computing fluid flows;              
              such problems arise often in science and engineering.                          
              Three-dimensional flows are common in real problems, but difficult             
              to compute.  This research extends the theory of two-dimensional               
              vortex methods and applies them to a touchstone three-dimensional              
              problem.
