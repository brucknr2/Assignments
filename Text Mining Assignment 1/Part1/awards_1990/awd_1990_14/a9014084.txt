Abstract    :
              This award provides the NSF share of the cost for support                      
              of the Water Science Technology Board which is the focal                       
              point for studies related to environmental engineering                         
              aspects of water management.  The Board's objective is to                      
              improve the scientific and technological basis for                             
              resolving important questions and issues relating in                           
              significant part to environmental engineering practice.                        
              An important function of the Board is to conduct workshops                     
              and conferences results of which are utilized in program                       
              planning.  It also serves as a coordinating mechanism for                      
              Federal agencies supporting research relating to the                           
              environmental and ocean systems program.
