Abstract    :
                   In response to concerns about health-related problems associated          
              with the drift of agricultural pesticides to people located near               
              application sites, safer, more concentrated means of application have          
              been developed.  Major questions remain unanswered regarding the degree        
              to which people are still exposed to chronic, low-level amounts of             
              pesticides.  This project will evaluate of data on pesticide                   
              applications, weather patterns, and population patterns from sites in          
              California, Ohio, and New Jersey to test three hypotheses related to           
              the impacts of agricultural pesticides on suburban residential                 
              populations:  (1) Traditional analyses of pesticide drift as a hazard          
              only when acute, high-level exposures occur underestimates levels of           
              potential chronic, low-level exposures, (2) suburban development into          
              agricultural areas magnifies possibilities for chronic, low-level              
              exposures, and (3) demographics patterns further increase risks because        
              suburban populations usually have higher proportions of children and           
              young adults, which are the groups most vulnerable to chronic pesticide        
              exposures.                                                                     
                   This project will significantly enhance our knowledge of the              
              dynamics by which pesticide drift affects nearby populations by                
              relating data from different sources in three representative but               
              distinctive sites.  The research also will provide valuable new                
              insights that can be used to evaluate current and prospective policies         
              regarding pesticide application and urban development, and it will             
              provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to              
              continue to develop independent research skills.
