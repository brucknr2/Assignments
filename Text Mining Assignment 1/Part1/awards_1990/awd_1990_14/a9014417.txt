Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research is to employ a new, generic                     
              approach to improving the ductility of intermetallic compounds of              
              the AB3-type.  The technique uses Pettifor maps and ALCHEMI and                
              X-ray diffraction to determine the relationship of new compounds               
              (created by selective alloying) relative to their crystal                      
              structure and near proximity to ductile alloys.  If this idea                  
              works, it will provide a more systematic approach to                           
              intermetallic alloy design.  This research is timely because of                
              current interest in intermetallic alloys for their high                        
              temperature applications and associated problems with low                      
              temperature ductility and toughness.
