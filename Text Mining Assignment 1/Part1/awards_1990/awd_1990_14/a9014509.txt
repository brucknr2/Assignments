Abstract    :
                   This grant provides partial support for an investigation                  
              of heavy ion reaction mechanisms by Prof. Peter Gonthier, Hope                 
              College.  The work will involve using the 4. detector array at                 
              the Michigan State University National Superconducting                         
              Cyclotron Laboratory, and equipment at SARA in Grenoble,                       
              France.  The experiments will attempt to understand the                        
              emission of light ejectiles from nuclear reactions induced by                  
              16O bombarding 58Ni at energies from 35 MeV/nucleon to 100                     
              MeV/nucleon.  Several undergraduate students will participate                  
              in these experiments.
