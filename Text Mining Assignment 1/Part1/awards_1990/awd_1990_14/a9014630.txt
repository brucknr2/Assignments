Abstract    :
                   This award enables Boston College to connect to NSFNET                    
              through a 56,000 bit per second connection to the mid-level network            
              NEARnet, the New England Academic and Research Network.  Access to             
              NSFNET provides Boston College faculty and students with increased             
              opportunity for collaboration and use of a wide range of research              
              tools such as supercomputing and shared databases.                             
                   Boston College is the last major New England university                   
              (ranked fourth in size of undergraduates and graduate students in              
              all of New England private schools) requiring NSFNET access.  The              
              campus has developed an extensive internal network with short term             
              goals of extending Ethernet fiber to all departments within the                
              College by 1992.
