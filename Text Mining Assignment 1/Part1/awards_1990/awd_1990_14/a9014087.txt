Abstract    :
              This project will study qualitative properties of nonlinear                    
              dynamical systems, with an emphasis on the following areas:                    
              (1) geometric theory of singularly perturbed differential                      
              equations, both finite and infinite dimensional; (2) differential              
              delay equations arising in various areas (physiology,                          
              optics,biology) of science; and (3) dynamical systems                          
              exhibiting monotone and gradient-like behavior. In all these                   
              areas the focus will be on global structures such as attractors,               
              periodic orbits, gradient structures and homo/heteroclinic                     
              orbits, and bifurcations of these structures.
