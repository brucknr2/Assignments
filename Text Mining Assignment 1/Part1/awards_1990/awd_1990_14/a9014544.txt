Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this proposal additional research equipment is requested to                 
              expand the capabilities of the advanced laser fluorescence                     
              apparatus recently constructed by the PI.  This improved                       
              apparatus will permit the PI to develop methodologies to                       
              perform - for the first time - fluorescence microscopy (FM)                    
              experiments on thin (monomolecular) films at liquid/liquid                     
              interfaces, thereby enabling him to investigate in-situ the                    
              structure and dynamics of this class of very important                         
              naturally occurring and technologically significant                            
              interfacial systems.  Applications include food and emulsion                   
              technology, biological and liquid membranes, and                               
              hydrometallurgical solvent extraction as well as fundamental                   
              studies of two-dimensional mass transfer at liquid/liquid                      
              interfaces.
