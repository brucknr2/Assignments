Abstract    :
                   This award enables Colby College to connect to NSFNET through             
              a 56,000 bit per second link to the mid-level network NEARnet, the             
              New England Academic and Research Network.  Access to NSFNET                   
              provides the faculty and students with access to supercomputers,               
              data archives, a variety of network gateways, automated library                
              catalogs, and a wide range of software.  The connection is                     
              particularly important to Colby, which is located in a relatively              
              remote section of the country.                                                 
                   It is of value to the natural science students and faculty,               
              not only giving access to supercomputers, but also in facilitating             
              joint research with distant collaborators, and providing them with             
              immediate access to data necessary to their work.  The benefits                
              accrue to the social science faculty and students, including those             
              in the humanities, especially in projects involving quantitative               
              applications.  Further, as the competititon for the best faculty               
              grows stiffer each year, the connection to NEARnet and NSFNET will             
              be a powerful factor in Colby's success in recruiting outstanding              
              faculty, particularly in the sciences.
