Abstract    :
              The American Mathematical Society will undertake a project called              
              e-math, whose purpose will be to provide and electronic                        
              environment tailored to the needs of mathematicians in their                   
              research and educational activities.  It is planned to give them               
              easy electronic access to each other, to a set of databases, and               
              to specialized software available for specific machines and                    
              applications.  This project will utilize current and projected                 
              technological advances, and will exploit networking and                        
              collaboration environments as they emerge.
