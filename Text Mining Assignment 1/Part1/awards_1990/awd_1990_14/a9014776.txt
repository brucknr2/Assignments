Abstract    :
              Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate                   
              structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of                 
              a vast array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic                         
              molecules.  When combined with gas chromatography (GC), the                    
              resulting GC/MS affords the chemist one of the most powerful                   
              tools available for the seperation and characterization of                     
              compounds.  The acquisition of GC/MS is essential for the                      
              prosecution of frontier research in many fields of chemistry.                  
                                                                                             
              The Department ofChemistry at the University of California at                  
              Irvine will use this award from the Chemistry Research                         
              Instrumentation Program to help acquire a GC/MS system.  The                   
              areas of chemical research that will enhance by the acquisition                
              include the following:
