Abstract    :
              The Organic Dynamics program will support Professor Paul Dowd's                
              study of "Synthesis of Vitamin K Models" in the Chemistry                      
              Department at the University of Pittsburgh.  Vitamin K is                      
              required for blood clotting, where it is an essential cofactor                 
              in the complex enzymic sequence known as the blood clotting                    
              cascade.   This study will explore a new experimental model for                
              the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation reaction since in the                    
              absence of carboxylation blood clotting is inhibited.                          
                                                                                             
              A variety of methods are being used to study the new                           
              experimental model for the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation                   
              reaction, including inter- and intramolecular condensation                     
              reactions, oxygen labelling experiments, exploration of new                    
              strong bases, and new oxygenation reactions.  Model experiments                
              will determine whether molecular oxygen triggers the                           
              carboxylation reaction  by reacting with the anionic form of                   
              vitamin K hydroquinone to produce vitamin K oxide, whose                       
              formation provides the energy necessary to furnish a base                      
              sufficiently strong to effect carboxylation.
