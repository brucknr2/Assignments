Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Twelfth International Congress for Electron Microscopy will                
              convene in Seattle in August, 1990, as the first world EM                      
              Congress to be held in the United States since 1962.  This mile-               
              stone event will establish the directions and objectives for the               
              theory and practice of microscopy and determine research                       
              priorities for the remainder of the century.  Although the                     
              emphasis will be on electron microscopy, other advanced forms of               
              imaging, such as confocal microscopy and scanning tunneling                    
              microscopy, will also receive full coverage.  The scientific                   
              program is arranged around some 55 symposia and about 250                      
              lectures by recognized international experts on imaging of                     
              crystalline and amorphous materials, surface and bulk                          
              microanalysis and applications to structural and microelectronic               
              materials.  More than 2600 scientific participants are expected                
              to attend and contribute at least 2800 platform and poster                     
              papers.
