Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the research of a graduate student in                    
              cultural anthropology who will study the work of family artisans               
              who make food specialty items in southwest France.  The project                
              will study how such family firms reproduce their economic                      
              activity in the context of a post-industrial society.  These                   
              producers are based in local household or family settings for                  
              production, yet have organized themselves into guilds to                       
              represent their interests in the wider society.   Using                        
              participant observation and in-depth life history interviews the               
              student will analyze how small family-based producers have been                
              able to reaffirm their autonomy and mobilize their constituency                
              in a context that assumed their disappearance or marginality.                  
                                                                                             
              This research is important because family owned business has                   
              historically been the key to community development for defined                 
              groups.  Understanding how one such well-defined group has                     
              asserted and defended its interests can help us understand how                 
              groups in general can prosper, and so design policies that aid                 
              groups that have historically not been able to succeed in family               
              owned business.
