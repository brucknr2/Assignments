Abstract    :
              The binding of polyelectrolytes to oppositely charged colloids                 
              and surfaces is important in biological phenomena and in                       
              environmental processes.  The binding energetics are controlled                
              by the colloid surface charge density, the effective charge of                 
              the polyion binding sequence, and the Debye screening length.                  
              The structure of the resultant complexes or aggregates depends,                
              in addition, on the dimensions of the colloidal particle, the                  
              chain length of the polyion, and the concentrations of these two               
              species.  This work describes polyelectrolyte - nonionic/ionic                 
              micelle systems as a paradigm for the investigation of these                   
              effects.  Interaction energetics will be explored by establishing              
              the interrelationship among various parameters at critical                     
              binding conditions.  The structure of soluble polyion-micelle                  
              complexes will be explored using static and dynamic light                      
              scattering, as a function of the dimensions of the two macroionic              
              species.  Of special interest is the transition from intrapolymer              
              micelle binding, to polymer bridging of micelles, as the size of               
              the micelle increases relative to that of the polyion.                         
              Phenomenological relationships developed will be compared to                   
              current theoretical treatments, and their general utility will be              
              evaluated for other charged colloids, e.g. silica.
