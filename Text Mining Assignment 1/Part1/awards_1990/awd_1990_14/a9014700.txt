Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              The research will involve one six-week trip to the Coeur d'Alene               
              Reservation in northern Idaho, where the student researcher will               
              conduct linguistic field work focusing on grammatical relations                
              in Coeur d'Alene Salish, a North American Indian language.                     
              Grammatical relations (subject, object) are indicated as elements              
              of both word formation and sentence structure; their roles are                 
              dependent on factors of control and transitivity inherent in the               
              root, and transitivity and incorporation indicated in the word                 
              stem; and the relations are often interpretable only with an                   
              understanding of discourse structure.  This investigation will                 
              contribute to the completion of the student's University of Texas              
              doctoral dissertation in linguistics.  The study will add                      
              significantly to the limited body of descriptive information                   
              available on Coeur d'Alene and to the understanding of the                     
              morphology and syntax of Interior Salishan languages in general,               
              and will eventually serve as a basis for comparative Salish                    
              syntax studies.  Major topics will include the morphological and               
              syntactic structures used to indicate grammatical relations; the               
              function of (preposition)                                                      
              incorporation and lexical suffixation to alter or specify                      
              grammatical relations; the use of clitics and adjuncts to cross-               
              reference relations indicated by subject and object pronouns on                
              the stem; and the roles of these relations in syntax and                       
              discourse.
