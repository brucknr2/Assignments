Abstract    :
              This research project is concerned with the study of the                       
              photoelectronic properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon and               
              related semiconductors continuing previous work in three general               
              directions.  These are:  1) electrons in states at and above the               
              mobility edge using the optical time-of-flight method developed                
              by the researcher with the objective of understanding the nature               
              of the extended states in these materials; 2) the time of                      
              evolution of photoinduced infrared spectra in the femto- and                   
              picosecond ranges to understand the ultrafast carrier dynamics of              
              carrier trapping of gap states and electron-lattice relaxation;                
              3) using steady-state photomodulation spectroscopy to study the                
              gap states of high quality hydrogenated amorphous germanium which              
              has recently become available.  This latter technique will also                
              be extended to hydrogenated amorphous silicon doped with                       
              phosphorous.
