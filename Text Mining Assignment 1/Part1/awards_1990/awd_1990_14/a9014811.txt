Abstract    :
                   The Supercomputer Computations Research Institute of                      
              Florida State University will host the physics conference                      
              Lattice '90 in Tallahassee during 8-12 October 1990.  This                     
              annual conference has rotated between the U.S. and Europe for                  
              the past six years, and is the main international conference                   
              for lattice field theory.  In lattice field theory, one                        
              attempts to understand theoretically the strong nuclear                        
              interactions of the elementary particles by making an                          
              approximation in which the continuum of space is replaced by a                 
              discrete lattice of points.                                                    
                   Topics that will be extensively discussed at this                         
              conference include lattice computations of the masses of                       
              strongly-interacting particles, the potential between quarks,                  
              weak nuclear processes, the phase transition in which quarks                   
              become free, and new developments in algorithms and special                    
              purpose machines.                                                              
                   The annual Lattice conference regularly draws about 200 of                
              the most outstanding researchers in the field, and provides                    
              them with an important opportunity to exchange ideas in an area                
              of research which has become a major component of theoretical                  
              elementary particle physics.
