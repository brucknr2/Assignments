Abstract    :
                   Lagrangean decomposition (LD) and Lagrangean                              
              decomposition/aggregation (LD/A) are powerful tools for computing              
              bounds in integer programming.  This is a project to study LD for              
              minmax problems and for separable problems with a nonlinear                    
              objective function.  The research will develop solutions for LD/A              
              problems which decompose into relatively easy subproblems, some or             
              all of them with the integrality property, so that the LD/A bound              
              is as good as (i.e. equal to) the corresponding Lagrangean                     
              Relaxation bound.  Moreover the LD/A procedure occasionally yields             
              the optimal solution in the not infrequent instance when the                   
              subproblems have identical solutions.                                          
                   There is a need for investigation into the LD and LD/A minimax            
              problems.  There is a strong potential for a breakthrough in                   
              computational efficiency.
