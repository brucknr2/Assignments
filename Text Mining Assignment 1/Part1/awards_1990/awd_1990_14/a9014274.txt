Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                  
              Training Group in Plant Cell Biology.  The faculty group is a                  
              mixture of outstanding senior and junior investigators who come                
              from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, but share a common                 
              interest in cell biology.  The funds will provide stipends for                 
              graduate students, will support research participation by                      
              undergraduate students, will defray part of the cost of the                    
              trainees' research and will enable the trainees to attend                      
              scientific meetings.  In addition, funds will be used to purchase              
              specialized research equipment to be used by trainees, and to bring            
              investigators from other research and academic institutions to the             
              Davis campus for seminars and symposia.                                        
                                                                                             
              In recent years, the use of new techniques for microscopy and the              
              use of genetics and biochemistry has led to significant new                    
              knowledge of the architecture and function of the cell.  Much of               
              this progress has come through study of microbial and animal cells.            
              The growth of knowledge of such features particular to plant cells             
              has lagged.  There is now a significant need for the training of               
              new researchers skilled in the study of cell biology of plants.                
              This award to one of the country's most outstanding groups of plant            
              cell biologists should help to address the need.
