Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                  
              Training Group in the Study of the Role of Transition Metals in                
              Biology.  The faculty group is a mixture of outstanding senior and             
              junior investigators who come from a variety of disciplinary                   
              backgrounds, but share a common interest in the role of transition             
              metals in biological processes.  The funds will provide stipends               
              for graduate students and will support research participation by               
              undergraduate students.  Funds will also defray part of the cost               
              of the trainees' research, and will be used to purchase specialized            
              research equipment to be used by trainees.  Funds for an annual                
              workshop that will bring investigators from other research and                 
              academic institutions to the Georgia campus.                                   
                                                                                             
              In recent years, the combination of new genetic techniques with                
              powerful biophysical and biochemical approaches has led to                     
              significant new knowledge of the architecture and function of                  
              enzymes and other proteins.  An important aspect of this new                   
              knowledge is an increased appreciation of the central role played              
              by transition metal ions in a large variety of biological                      
              processes.  It is clear that continued progress in this area will              
              require the training of a new generation of researchers with an                
              understanding of modern genetics, biochemistry, molecular                      
              biophysics and inorganic chemistry.
