Abstract    :
              The feasibility of using electrokinetics to remove organic                     
              contaminants from soil and groundwater will be investigated.  A                
              better understanding of the fundamental aspects of electrokinetic              
              soil processing is indispensable to state and federal environmental            
              programs and to the private waste management industry.  Improvement            
              of electrokinetics soil processing could result in a significant               
              impact on waste remediation technology in the nation.
