Abstract    :
              The remarkable recent advances in genetic engineering now                      
              allow industrial-scale production of therapeutic proteins                      
              for human health care.  With the introduction of new                           
              production methods have come immense purification                              
              challenges.  In order to avoid untoward side effects of                        
              contaminants (many of which are as yet unknown),                               
              therapeutic proteins must be ultra-purified to levels                          
              beyond the scope of present technology.  Thus, there is a                      
              great need for novel separation and purification                               
              techniques which may be applied on an industrial scale.                        
                                                                                             
              This multi-investigator study is an effort to integrate                        
              several innovative technologies ?such as High Performance                      
              Liquid Chromatography, (HPLC), electrophoresis, and                            
              supercritical-fluid based separations! to provide a basis                      
              for industrial ultrapurification of biomacromolecules.                         
              Applications of such new purification and separation                           
              technologies will be tested on recombinant tissue                              
              plasminogen activator, a life-saving therapeutic used in                       
              the treatment of heart attack victims.
