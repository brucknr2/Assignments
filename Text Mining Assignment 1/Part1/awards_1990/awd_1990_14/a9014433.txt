Abstract    :
                   The Baringo Basin in the Rift Valley of East Africa has been              
              one of the most productive areas in the world for finding                      
              hominoid fossils from the important period of 4-14 million years               
              ago (mya).  Reconstructing paleoenvironments for this period is                
              highly relevant to determining whether development of open                     
              landscapes should be considered a pivotal driving mechanism                    
              during this period in human history.  Paleohabitat reconstruction              
              can provide proximate causes for divergence and subsequent                     
              radiation of the Hominidae.  In particular, Late Miocene and                   
              Pliocene sediments exposed along the eastern flanks of the Tugen               
              Hills, west of Lake Baringo, have yielded extensive fossil                     
              vertebrate assemblages including 6 of the 11 unequivocal hominoid              
              specimens known from Africa in this time range.  These exposures               
              provide a unique opportunity to establish a detailed                           
              environmental-ecological context in which change in human fossils              
              over time may be assessed.  Preliminary isotopic data and                      
              previous analyses of fossil fauna suggest major alteration of the              
              Tugen Hills habitat between 6 mya and 9 mya.  This research will               
              provide high resolution stratigraphic, geochemical, and                        
              paleontologic data collected from horizons in the 2-12 mya                     
              interval which will be used to reconstruct aspects of                          
              paleohabitat and paleocommunity and to determine more precisely                
              the timing and nature of environmental change in the Baringo                   
              Basin.
