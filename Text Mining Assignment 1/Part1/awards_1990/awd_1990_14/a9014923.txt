Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                    
              metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Wayland will                       
              continue his studies of the organometallic reactivity of                       
              macrocyclic complexes of Rh(II) and Ir(II).  These fundamental                 
              studies have the long range goal of providing proper design of                 
              metal complexes that will convert simple hydrocarbons into more                
              useful compounds.                                                              
                                                                                             
              A primary objective will be to achieve a fundamental under-                    
              standing of the thermodynamic and kinetic-mechanistic basis for                
              the observed reactivity of Group 9 metallomacrocycles.  The                    
              focus will be on examining reactions of alkanes and carbon                     
              monoxide with Rh(II) and Ir(II) porphyrins.  Both thermodynamic                
              and mechanistic criteria will be used in designing metal                       
              complexes for the purpose of expanding the range of reactivity                 
              and producing reaction selectivity.  Major long range goals                    
              include the systematic use of ligand and metal variation to                    
              tune thermodynamic factors and design of ligand systems that                   
              provide preorganization of the transition states for specific                  
              reactions.
