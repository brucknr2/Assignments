Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The use of object oriented programming languages can greatly                   
              simplify the debugging and maintenance of software.  In                        
              particular, the C++ programming language is well suited for                    
              scientific computation.  This proposal will benchmark a C++                    
              implementation of a theoretical physics application (calculations              
              using light front Hamiltonian dynamics of few body systems) and                
              compare its relative performance to a Fortran code of the same                 
              problem.  In addition library codes necessary for the                          
              applications codes will be linked to the C++ program.   The work               
              will be done on a Unix workstation and a Cray Y-MP/832                         
              supercomputer.
