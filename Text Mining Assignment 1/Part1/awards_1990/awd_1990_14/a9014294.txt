Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                  
              Training Group in Studies of Urban Poverty, Race and Social Policy             
              through a collaborative effort of faculty members at the University            
              of Chicago and Northwestern University.   The faculty group is a               
              mixture of outstanding junior and senior investigators who come                
              from a variety of disciplines.  These include sociology, economics             
              and public policy.  The funds provided to Northwestern University              
              by this award will provide stipends for graduate students and                  
              postdoctoral fellows, and will defray part of the cost of the                  
              trainees' research.  In addition, funds will be used to purchase               
              specialized research equipment to be used by trainees, and to bring            
              investigators from other research and academic institutions for                
              symposia and colloquia.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Understanding the structure of modern American society and the                 
              problems it poses for the development and implementation of public             
              policy is one of the most significant challenges for social                    
              scientists.  Sophisticated research in this area now requires that             
              paradigms and techniques from economics, political science and                 
              demography be coupled.  This RTG program will produce a new                    
              generation of investigators and teachers with the necessary                    
              combination of intellectual and research skills.
