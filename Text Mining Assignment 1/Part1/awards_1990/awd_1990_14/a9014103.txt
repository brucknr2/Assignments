Abstract    :
                   The object of this study is to examine fundamental                        
              interactions of electrons and positrons with atoms.  Special                   
              attention is given to spin dependent effects, coherence and                    
              correlation phenomena.                                                         
                   The project consists of two related parts; first, the                     
              reduced density matrix formalism is used to provide a                          
              systematic description of collision processes in terms of a few                
              well defined, measurable parameters, and second, numerical                     
              calculations based on perturbative (Distorted Wave) and non-                   
              purturbative (R-matrix) techniques are used to predict these                   
              parameters.
