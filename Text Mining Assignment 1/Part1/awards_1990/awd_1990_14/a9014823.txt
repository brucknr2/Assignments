Abstract    :
                   This project examines a number of problems associated with                
              interior point methods for linear programming. It begins with the              
              observation that under certain conditions the affine scalding                  
              algorithm converges at a superlinear rate when applied to the                  
              feasibility problem.  Then every linear programming problem is                 
              approximated by a feasibility problem.                                         
                   The main technical difficulties have to do with degeneracies              
              in linear programming problems.  With assumptions about problems               
              being nondegenerate results about superlinear convergence are                  
              proved, but superlinear convergence has been observed even in                  
              degenerate cases.  So what is actually required for superlinear                
              convergence is not clear.                                                      
                   Trying to accelerate affine scaling algorithms leads naturally            
              to questions about centers of polytopes.  The existence of a large             
              set of "centers" inside every polytope, except these equivalent to             
              simplicies is shown.  The affine scaling algorithm converges fast              
              when started at one of these general centers.  To discover means               
              of computing centers efficiently is a goal of this research.                   
                   After finding ways of accelerating convergence, the questions             
              of how to perform each step efficiently is addressed.  The least               
              square problems will be solved by a preconditioned conjugate                   
              gradient algorithm.
