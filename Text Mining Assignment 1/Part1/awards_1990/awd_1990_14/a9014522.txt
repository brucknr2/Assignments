Abstract    :
                   Professor Boston will work on classifying p-adic                          
              representations of Galois groups.  He hopes to show that in                    
              certain cases the deformation space defined by certain mod p                   
              representations is empty.  This in turn would imply the non-                   
              existence of certain elliptic curves.                                          
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved                       
              problems that withstood generations.  Among its many conse-                    
              quences are new error correcting codes.  Such codes are                        
              essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact                   
              disks.
