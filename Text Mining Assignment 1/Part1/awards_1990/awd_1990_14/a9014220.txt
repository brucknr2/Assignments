Abstract    :
              To exercise leadership, science and engineering educators need to              
              provide their students with the tools to identify and respond                  
              appropriately to professional problems with ethical dimensions.                
              This project will develop an innovative campus-wide program                    
              integrating ethics into the professional curriculum, a program                 
              professional societies could adapt to their continuing education               
              programs.  The project has four steps: 1) developing and offering              
              workshops for IIT faculty in how to teach professional ethics in               
              how to teach professional ethics in their technical courses;                   
              1) providing institutional support (a continuing seminar, case                 
              file, videos, and so on) for faculty introducing professional                  
              ethics into their technical courses; 3) redesigning existing                   
              capstone courses to include a design program requiring ethical                 
              difficult cooperation among students in two or more professional               
              programs; and 4) disseminating results through a day-and-a-half                
              working conference for staff and volunteers in continuing education            
              programs of professional societies and a weeklong version of the               
              workshop for faculty of other universities, as well as through                 
              presentations at professional meetings and publications in                     
              appropriate journals.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This proposal focuses on an important area in Ethics and Values                
              Studies.  The investigators are very well qualified; the plan is               
              thoughtful and feasible; university support is extremely good.                 
              Results are likely to improve the teaching of engineering                      
              ethics on this campus and in undergraduate curricula nationwide.               
                                                                                             
              Based on the merits of the proposal and the generally positive                 
              review, support is highly recommended.
