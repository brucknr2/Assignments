Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research will allow a cultural anthropologist                
              to study how cooperative ideologies and political entrepreneurs                
              function in agro-pastoral communities in the Andes mountains of                
              Peru.  The theory to be addressed deals with collective action on              
              common property, and the focus of the research is to see how                   
              individual decision making yields cooperative collective                       
              outcomes.  Methods include participant observation, agricultural               
              surveys, key informant interviewing, participant-observation of                
              work groups, and household surveys.                                            
                                                                                             
              This research is important because simplistic models of the                    
              "tragedy of the commons" have been widely publicized, and have                 
              led to an erroneous understanding of how actual commons are                    
              managed by real communities.  Studies of the actual collective                 
              management of common property will give models for understanding               
              how to sustain environmental processes in controlled access                    
              common property.
