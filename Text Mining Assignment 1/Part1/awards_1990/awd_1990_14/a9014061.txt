Abstract    :
                   Research will be carried out in the area of nuclear                       
              reaction studies using a radioactive beam of Li-8.  Information                
              which is important to understanding nucleosynthesis will be                    
              provided.  In addition, studies of heavy ion collisions will be                
              carried out towards the end of providing improved information                  
              on nuclear deformation.  Undergraduates will be involved in                    
              this research.
