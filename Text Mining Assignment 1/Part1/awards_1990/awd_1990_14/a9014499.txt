Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will study snow drift loads on                                     
              multilevel roofs, building on the results of                                   
              previous work, and with the objective of                                       
              broadening the existing knowledge base.  This                                  
              will be accomplished by taking into account                                    
              environmental factors, namely wind and                                         
              driftable snow, for the quantification of                                      
              this hazard.  Existing and measured wind and                                   
              snow information will be used for this                                         
              quantification.  A second task of this work                                    
              involves a field investigation of the                                          
              mechanics of drift formation.  The results of                                  
              the project will be used in the structural                                     
              design of roofs that will not collapse under                                   
              these extreme snow loads.
