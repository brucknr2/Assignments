Abstract    :
              Dr. Mehdi Saiidi of the University of Nevada, Reno, will                       
              visit Dr. Adam Wysokowski of the Polish Roads and Bridges                      
              Research Institute and Dr. P. Maliszkiewicz at the Technical                   
              University of Wroclaw to develop a cooperative research                        
              project on non-destructive techniques for evaluating highway                   
              bridge systems.  The resulting proposal is intended for                        
              consideration under the U.S.-Poland Cooperative Science                        
              Program or the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fund.  If successful,                    
              the project should contribute to our ability to conduct in-                    
              situ evaluation of reinforced concrete bridges.
