Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The Gas Chromatograph and Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) system                     
              separates mixtures of volatile compounds and identifies the                    
              masses of each separated component.  The GC/MS is essential                    
              when there is a need to quantify soluble compounds found in                    
              dilute solutions.  The GC/MS is useful in areas such as                        
              chemical synthesis, kinetics and structural analysis.                          
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Instrumentation Program to the                   
              Department of Chemistry at SUNY-Cortland, an undergraduate                     
              institution, will help acquire a GC/MS system.  The acquisition                
              will enhance the ability of the department to educate                          
              undergraduate students and will enhance chemical research in                   
              the following areas:
