Abstract    :
              A Study of the vibrational and rotational excitation of carbon                 
              monoxide scattered from nickel (lll) in order to probe the                     
              dynamics of precursor mediated adsorption, and obtain information              
              about the nature of the precursor state.  If the investigation                 
              shows evidence of a dynamic precursor, it will explain why other               
              researchers have not been able to isolate it.  The mechanism                   
              would apply to a large number of other molecule / metal surface                
              systems exhibiting surface chemistry.
