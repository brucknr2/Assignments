Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this research is to develop a control scheme               
              for laser machining to ensure optimal and repeatable process                   
              operation.  The research will concentrate on developing sensing                
              techniques for laser machining processes, developing a new sensor              
              integration approach, refining laser machining control models,                 
              developing a set of sensor models and formulating a controller                 
              design for responding to changes in state variables.
