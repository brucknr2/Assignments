Abstract    :
              NSF funds are requested to purchase enhancements to the                        
              instrument to facilitate the use of a microscope imaging system                
              by six research groups in the Department of Biological Science.                
              The quantitative fluorescence system will allow the researchers                
              to investigates a variety of new problems including the                        
              following: the role of calcium in prolactin secretion by                       
              pituitary cells, the regulation of the intracellular pH in                     
              molluscan myocytes, the role of calcium fluxes in the regulation               
              of gene expression in Chlamydonas, the distribution and potential              
              compartmentation of key proteins in brush border cells, the                    
              dynamics of intrecellular magnesium in muscle fibers and finally               
              the role of intracellular pH in motility in amoeboid cells.  The               
              acquisition of the quantitative fluorescence imaging system will               
              have significant impact on these six groups, all of which are                  
              externally funded.
