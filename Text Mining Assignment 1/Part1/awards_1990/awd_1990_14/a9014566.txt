Abstract    :
              This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface                    
              chemistry and in the subfield of chemically modified                           
              electrodes.  Professor Crooks will study new methods for                       
              constructing molecular assemblies on electrode surfaces that                   
              provide nanometer-scale templates for molecular imprinting.                    
                                                                                             
              This research will use a suite of surface-sensitive methods                    
              including scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force                          
              microscopy and electrochemical microscopy to characterize the                  
              molecular dimensions of these assemblies.  This work would be                  
              important in providing ways for developing new chemical                        
              sensors, new electronic materials and lithographic                             
              technologies.
