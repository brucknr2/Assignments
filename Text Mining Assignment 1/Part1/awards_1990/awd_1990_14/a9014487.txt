Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant is funded in the Materials Chemistry and Chemical                   
              Processing Initiative.  It is a collaborative effort between a                 
              chemist and a materials scientist that is concerned with the                   
              synthesis of new metal-organic precursors, the preparation of                  
              amorphous oxycarbides and crystalline carbides from these                      
              precursors, the elucidation of the structures of these new                     
              amorphous solids, the mechanisms of their transformations and the              
              measurement of their chemical, mechanical, electrical, optical                 
              and magnetic properties.  Specifically, the precursors for boron               
              carbide, boron/silicon carbide, iron carbide, tungsten carbide,                
              and vanadium carbide are being synthesized into thin films, bulk               
              solids, or fibers, and heat treated in inert atmospheres.
