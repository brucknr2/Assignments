Abstract    :
              This research studies a new control design methodology for                     
              uncertain dynamic systems, where the uncertainty is                            
              associated with the system's nonlinearity or time varying                      
              characteristics.  The intent is to develop a controller                        
              which does not depend on any knowledge of the uncertainty                      
              except its possible bound.  The control problem is                             
              formulated in a geometric manner where the uncertainty is                      
              described to lie within a hyperpolyhedron domain.  And                         
              since uncertainty on system performance occurs at the                          
              corner points of the hyperpolyhedron, it is sufficient to                      
              study the system behavior by examining the polyhedron                          
              corner points.  Computer dynamic programming techniques are                    
              used in searching for the solution.  The research comprises                    
              two components, a practical design problem, and an                             
              analytical design problem.  The analytical task examines                       
              the feasibility of using artificial neural networks to                         
              design and implement the control concept.  The practical                       
              design task will demonstrate the practicality of the method                    
              for a flexible beam structure with piezoelectric sensors                       
              and actuators.
