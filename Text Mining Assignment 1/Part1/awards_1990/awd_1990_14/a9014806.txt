Abstract    :
                   A broad-based program of theoretical and observational                    
              research on cosmic rays and their interaction with the magnetic                
              fields of the sun and the solar wind is proposed.  Included will               
              be the continued operation of the Thule and Newark neutron                     
              monitoring stations through 1993, including development of new                 
              electronic units for the detectors.  Specific tasks will include:              
              (1) detailed analysis of solar particle events occurring during                
              the present solar cycle, with special emphasis placed on                       
              understanding the remarkable fine structure observed in 1989.                  
              (2) sunspot cycle (11 year) and magnetic cycle (22 year)                       
              variations of the cosmic ray diurnal radial gradient.                          
              (3) sunspot cycle and solar magnetic cycle variation of the                    
              cosmic ray north-south anisotropy and radial gradient.                         
              (4) long-term variations and north-south asymmetries of the sun                
              and solar wind.                                                                
              (5) the three-dimensional structure of interplanetary magnetic                 
              turbulence, as revealed in cosmic ray measurements.                            
              (6) magnetic helicity effects in cosmic ray transport.                         
              (7) particle scattering near 90 degrees pitch angle during                     
              dissipative, dynamic turbulence.  ***
