Abstract    :
                   This project will (1) complete the implementation of the                  
              existing design for an experimental expert retrieval assistance                
              system in the workstation environment; (2) test the effectiveness              
              of the system through experimentation and analysis; and (3)                    
              depending on the results of the analysis, devise more refined                  
              and comprehensive search models and assistance techniques.  The                
              techniques used incorporate such functionality as (1) estimating               
              absolute and relative search relevance based on several spectra                
              of matching criteria; (2) automatic ranking of documents by                    
              relevance using existing tools from current Boolean-based                      
              systems; and (3) optimization of search strategies based on user               
              relevance feedback.  These new techniques will be integrated with              
              a collection of assistance aides in the current system including               
              (1) automatic execution of search strategies in different                      
              databases including translation from a common command language;                
              (2) search strategies derived automatically from user's natural                
              language phrases; and (3) recall estimation based on both formal               
              search features and empirical search results.  These models and                
              techniques, termed "smart Boolean", will advance information                   
              retrieval from an intuitive art toward a rational quantified                   
              decision-making process.
