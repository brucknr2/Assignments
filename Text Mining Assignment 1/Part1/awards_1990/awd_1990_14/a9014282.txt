Abstract    :
              This award will enhance and strengthen the interactions between the            
              statisticians and social scientists at UCLA.  THis interaction will            
              be directed through support for graduate students and equipment.               
              This group of researchers will focus on five areas of research and             
              teaching:  introductory statistics teaching, simultaneous equations            
              and latent structure analysis, secondary structure analysis,                   
              multilevel analysis and hierarchical data structure, and                       
              computational and computer intensive statistics.  The activities               
              of this group represents a cross disciplinary approach to problems             
              at the interface between statistics and social sciences, where the             
              substantive disciplinary questions drive the development of                    
              statistics.
