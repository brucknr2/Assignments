Abstract    :
              This award is for a workshop for young investigators engaged in                
              social science research on the societal impacts of computing.                  
              The workshop provides an opportunity for early career                          
              investigators to present their research and to discuss matters of              
              particular concern to young investigators.  Twenty participants                
              are invited by senior researchers studying various aspects of                  
              computing in society.  The workshop is scheduled for September                 
              15-16, 1990 in the Washington D.C. area.  This activity provides               
              one means of infrastructure development to attract scholars to                 
              careers in studying problems of societal concern centering about               
              the phenomenon of computing.
