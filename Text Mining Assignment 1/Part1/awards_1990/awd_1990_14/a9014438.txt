Abstract    :
                   This connection to NSFNET improves the instruction and                    
              research capabilities of essentially every department on the                   
              Middlebury College campus.  Typical applications include the                   
              exchange of two-dimensional images among members of an                         
              undergraduate astronomy consortium; interactive login by upper-                
              level computer science students on a parallel processing machine;              
              and improved access to databases such as MEDLINE, Chemical                     
              Abstracts and the MLA International Bibliography.  Further,                    
              Middlebury's specialized library collections, such as that at the              
              Institute for Northern Studies, is now available to off-campus                 
              scholars.  The connection aids Middlebury's recruiting of the high-            
              caliber faculty they need to maintain and improve their academic               
              programs.  The link is a critical resource for research and                    
              instruction.
