Abstract    :
                   This award enables Tufts University to attach its campus-wide             
              network to NSFNET through a 56,000 bit per second line to NEARNET,             
              the New England Regional Network.  This connection allows Tuft's               
              researchers to: 1) access supercomputer facilities for a wide range            
              of funded research projects; 2) conduct joint/ collaborative                   
              research projects at a variety of remote sites; 3) routinely access            
              remote data bases and archives; 4) greatly simplify and improve the            
              performance of their former multiple external network connections;             
              and 5) improve mail, file transfer and remote login capabilities.
