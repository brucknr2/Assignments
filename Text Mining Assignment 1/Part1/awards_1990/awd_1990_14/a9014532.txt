Abstract    :
              This proposal is concerned with ultrasonic Lamb                                
              waves, which are elastic waves that propagate in                               
              plates of finite thickness.  Our interest in these waves                       
              has been stimulated by the developments of the last                            
              2-3 years during which Lamb wave devices have been                             
              successfully fabricated on plates that are thinner than                        
              1 um.  Waves propagating in such thin structures                               
              possess a number of attractive features for use in                             
              physical, chemical, and biological sensors.  Lamb                              
              waves also provide a convenient tool for measuring                             
              the elastic properties of self-supporting thin films and                       
              microminiature mechanical structures.                                          
                                                                                             
              The aim of this project is to carry out theoretical and                        
              experimental investigation of the generation and                               
              detection of Lamb waves.  Four different device                                
              configurations will be considered.  These are:  (1)                            
              piezoelectric plate excited by surface electrodes, (2)                         
              composite membrane consisting of piezoelectric film                            
              deposited on a nonpiezoelectric plate, (3)                                     
              electrostrictive excitation in a nonpiezoelectric plate,                       
              and (4) excitation of Lamb waves in a                                          
              nonpiezoelectric plate using surface stress sources.                           
              Results obtained from theoretical analysis will be                             
              experimentally verified.  Besides enabling us to                               
              completely characterize a given transducer, the                                
              proposed research will also lead to the design of                              
              more efficient Lamb wave transducers.
