Abstract    :
              Description:  This proposal requests funds for the partial                     
              support of a conference on agricultural management in                          
              salt-affected areas to be held in October 1990 in Agadir,                      
              Morocco.  The conference has as its major objective the                        
              transfer of information and knowledge on ecophysiological                      
              problems relating to saline soils.  The PI, Dr. D.W. Rains,                    
              is one of the leading active researchers in the field.  The                    
              conference is organized in cooperation with the Institute                      
              Agronomique et Veterinaire Hassan II, a staff member of                        
              which, Dr. R. Choukr-Allah, will serve as local organizer.                     
              Both the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of                           
              Interior have been invited to address the conference.                          
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The five-day conference will include invited                           
              participants from 24 different countries.  Lectures and                        
              poster sessions will address the following topics:                             
              mechanisms of salt tolerance, genetic aspects of salt                          
              tolerance, crop management under saline conditions,                            
              halophyte utilization in agriculture, and soil and water                       
              management aspects of irrigation with highly saline water.                     
              NSF support will help allow seven experts from the U.S.                        
              participate in the conference.  As the conference is                           
              research oriented and focused on developing country                            
              problems, this proposal fulfils objectives of the Science in                   
              Developing Countries Program.
