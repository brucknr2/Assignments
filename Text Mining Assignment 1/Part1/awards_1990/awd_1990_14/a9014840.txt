Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this work is the development of new efficient                      
              algorithms that learn classifying rules ("concepts") from                      
              examples, as well as the characterization of those types of                    
              concepts for which such efficient learning algorithms exist.                   
              Algorithms for inference os string patterns for logic programs,                
              and for various types of boolean functions will be developed, and              
              new learning algorithms in naturally motivated domains will be                 
              sought.  The approach will also focus on extending known                       
              structural and combinatorial characterizations of learnable                    
              concept classes so as to be more widely applicable, and so as to               
              address the learnability of concepts when the learning algorithms              
              may pose various queries to a human expert.//
