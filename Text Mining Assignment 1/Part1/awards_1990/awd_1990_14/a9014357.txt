Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research                            
              project between Dr. John Rohrbaugh of the State University                     
              of New York, Albany, and Dr. Janos Veesenyi of the                             
              International Management Center, Budapest, is to                               
              undertake a structured examination of multi-party                              
              conflict resolution.  Using case studies, the researchers                      
              will employ cross-cultural comparative analyses of                             
              negotiation support systems.  Results are expected to                          
              contribute to our understanding of ways to assist multi-                       
              party negotiation which subsequently may prove useful to                       
              practitioners in conflict management in a variety of                           
              contexts.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project in decision and risk management science                           
              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific                         
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United                            
              States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                             
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong                         
              mutual interest and competence.
