Abstract    :
              This award is for the continued support of the semi-annual                     
              meetings of the Universities Research Conference.  The purpose of              
              this conference series is to bring together economists from                    
              throughout the country for two days of in-depth discussion of a                
              specific topic of current interest.  Conference topics are chosen              
              for their relevance to current economic policy issues, as well as              
              for their interest to academic economists.  Recent conferences                 
              have focused on international aspects of fiscal policies,                      
              monetary policy, trade policy, and government spending programs.               
              Papers for presentation are solicited from over 70 economics                   
              departments and 50 business schools.  Conference organizers are                
              careful to select a mix of established and less well known                     
              researchers.  Discussants and other participants are also chosen               
              to encourage interaction among economists with similar interests               
              at different universities.  A typical conference includes 7 to 10              
              papers and about 80 participants from 25 universities.                         
                                                                                             
              This conference series represents a unique and valuable forum for              
              researchers who might have little opportunity to interact with                 
              other specialists in their field.  Past conferences have been                  
              well run, the quality of the papers presents has been high, and                
              the topics selected for discussion have been important and                     
              timely.
