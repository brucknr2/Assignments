Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing research of Professor Nicholas J. Turro at Columbia                 
              University. Results from this research will provide fundamental                
              information about the behavior of reactive intermediates in                    
              restricted spaces. The research includes studies of excited                    
              molecules and reactive intermediates on organized molecular                    
              surfaces and cavities. One aspect of this study is the interaction             
              of excited state molecules that are complexed to DNA.                          
                                                                                             
              There are several general areas to which attention will be given               
              in this project: (1) development of new techniques to detect and               
              study reactive species that are produced by photolysis of                      
              molecules; (2) a study of radical pairs adsorbed on surfaces: (3)              
              an investigation of flexible biradicals in homogeneous solution                
              and in restricted spaces; (4) metal complexes as probes of binding             
              of DNA structure and photoelectron transfer processes on DNA; and              
              (5) research on photoinduced electron transfer on starburst                    
              dendrimers.
