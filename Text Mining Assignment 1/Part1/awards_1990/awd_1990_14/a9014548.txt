Abstract    :
                   The aim of this project is to increase the relatively low                 
              usage of computers in the entire range of upper level courses                  
              taken by physics undergraduates at schools across the nation                   
              and abroad.  A group of 27 physicists will be assembled to                     
              write and test computer software and associated texts for use                  
              in nine advanced undergraduate physics courses.  The 27                        
              physicists will work in teams of three, one for each course, at                
              their own institutions.  The software is intended for use by                   
              students as homework assignments and special projects, and                     
              also by instructors during in-class demonstrations.  It will be                
              disseminated in the form of a series of text modules and                       
              accompanying diskettes to be published by a commercial or                      
              university publisher.
