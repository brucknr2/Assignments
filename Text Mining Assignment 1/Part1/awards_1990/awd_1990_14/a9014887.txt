Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist from the University of Hawaii who will study the                
              role of remittances as a household strategy in Tonga, a small                  
              Polynesian kingdom.  Remittances, meaning money sent to relatives              
              by migrant workers in other countries, are increasingly important              
              in many Third World countries.  This research will identify the                
              extent to which migration and remittances are employed as a                    
              strategy to meet household goals; will document how remittance                 
              income is incorporated into the village economy; and will analyze              
              how remittances affect village social organization.  Methods used              
              include participant observation, archival research on government               
              statistics, formal life-history interviews with villagers, and a               
              survey of household resources.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This research will illuminate the role of remittances in the                   
              economic life of the local community from which the emigrants                  
              departed.  It will provide useful information to people concerned              
              about the impact of remittance income on poor societies as well                
              as the values and concerns that impel certain individuals to                   
              migrate while others stay home.  This kind of knowledge can                    
              generalize to help us understand migration within one country                  
              (i.e., between north and south USA) as well as between countries.
