Abstract    :
              Efficient learning algorithms that use additional information in the           
              form of queries to a teacher will be studied, with particular emphasis         
              on the capabilities and limitations of algorithms that use equivalence         
              and membership queries.  Techniques from computational complexity, the         
              analysis of algorithms, and cryptography will be applied to narrow the         
              gap between provably efficiently learnable and provably not                    
              efficiently learnable classes of concepts.  The problem of missing or          
              incorrect answers to queries and their effects on the learnability of          
              various concrete hypothesis classes will be studied.  The problem of           
              approximating a distribution by sampling will be studied as a method           
              of extending Valiant's paradigm of "probably approximately correct"            
              identification to problems in which negative examples are absent.
