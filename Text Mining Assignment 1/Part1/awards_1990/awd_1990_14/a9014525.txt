Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is the experimental and                    
              theoretical investigation of vortices produced in a laboratory                 
              chamber.  The field of motion will be measured by a laser doppler              
              velocimeter; the results, and the suitability of future                        
              experiments, will be guided by an existing three dimensional                   
              numerical model.  The experimental vortices are designed to have               
              a useful similarity with those of broad geophysical interest.
