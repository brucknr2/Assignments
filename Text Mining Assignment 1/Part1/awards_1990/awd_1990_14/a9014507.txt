Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award will support course on stereology for North                    
              American neuroscientists.  The techniques to be taught will allow              
              for an unbiased quantitative analysis of morphological                         
              structures.  Participants will be given first hand experience                  
              through lectures and laboratory exercises provided by scientists               
              who are the forerunners of quantitative anatomy.
