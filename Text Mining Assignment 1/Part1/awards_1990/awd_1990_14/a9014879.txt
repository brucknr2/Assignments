Abstract    :
                   A Group of physicists consisting of three faculty, two                    
              research associates and five graduate students is performing                   
              experiments to study the details of the strong interactions                    
              among elementary particles.  The program consists of three                     
              major components:                                                              
              1. Experiment E776 at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient                      
              Synchrotron.  A large sample of about one billion events                       
              produced through the interaction protons with protons and                      
              neutrons with protons is being studied.  A variety of important                
              physics topics is being investigated in a detail never before                  
              possible.                                                                      
              2. A new approach to massive computation and on-line data                      
              acquisition.  To achieve the sensitivity required, the group                   
              has developed and is now implementing a hardware computational                 
              system that acts in consort with the data acquisition.  The                    
              system has achieved 41 gigaoperations per second (compared to 1                
              giga=operation per second for a Cray X-MP) and data bandwidths                 
              of 32 gigabytes per second.  This performance has been achieved                
              at about 2% of the cost of a Cray X-MP.                                        
              3. Experiment E609 at the Fermilab Tevatron. Much of the                       
              apparatus from the Brookhaven experiment has been moved to                     
              Fermilab where the program will continue at higher energy.  The                
              full power of the hardware will be used to investigate rare                    
              phenomena.
