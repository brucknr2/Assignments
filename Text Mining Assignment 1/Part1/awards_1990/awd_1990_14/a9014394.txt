Abstract    :
              The oxidation of organic compounds is of concern in fuel                       
              cells, synthetic electrochemistry, pollution control, and gas                  
              sensing.  The complexity of the desired reactions allows                       
              opportunities for unwanted side reactions to occur, with the                   
              formation of undesirable blocking intermediates.  To perform                   
              organic oxidations without such complications, there is a need                 
              for the proper metal surface to facilitate adsorption and                      
              cracking of molecules, as well as powerful oxidizing                           
              conditions to overcome strongly bound intermediates.  The                      
              latter conditions are found, but are not limited to situations                 
              where oxide semiconductors such as n-ZnO, N-TiO2, and                          
              n-SrTiO3A are used as the catalyst.  The PI plans to combine                   
              the desirable properties of both metals and semiconductors to                  
              achieve an advanced catalytic electrode for facile oxidation                   
              reactions by fabricating the electrode to take advantage of                    
              the hot hole effect.                                                           
                                                                                             
              He is planning studies of dark injection and photo-injection                   
              of hot holes into thin metal films over n-type and p-type                      
              semiconductor substrates.  His hot carriers (holes) are                        
              available in the dark, and he will use metal films to                          
              radically alter the catalytic properties of the semiconductor                  
              surface.  The method features the formation of excited states                  
              at metal surfaces that have, in the past, been created only by                 
              high energy photoemission into the liquid electrolyte.  The                    
              physical and chemical properties of hot holes will be                          
              investigated with emphasis on oxidation of organic species                     
              such as CO and methanol and their oxidative intermediates.
