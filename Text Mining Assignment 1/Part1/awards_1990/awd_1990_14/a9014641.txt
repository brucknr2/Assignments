Abstract    :
              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the                
              research of Dr. Michael T. Crimmins of the Department of                       
              Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.                  
              Dr. Crimmins will develop methodology that uses                                
              photocycloaddition reactions to form four-membered rings.                      
              These ring containing compounds will then be modified into                     
              useful synthetic intermediates.                                                
                                                                                             
              The project will develop the utility of photochemical,                         
              intramolecular ?2+2! cycloaddition-cyclobutane fragmentation                   
              sequences.  The primary emphasis will be placed on the use of                  
              intramolecular photocycloadditions to rapidly increase                         
              molecular complexity while maintaining a high degree of                        
              stereochemical control.  The synthesis of several natural                      
              products will be used to indicate the versatility of the                       
              approach.
