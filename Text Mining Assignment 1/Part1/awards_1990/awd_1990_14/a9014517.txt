Abstract    :
                   Continuation of an experimental and theoretical research                  
              program is proposed that is focussed on the dynamics of atomic                 
              inner-shell processes and on multiphoton ionization in strong                  
              radiation measurements of correlation effects in deep-lying                    
              atomic states; concomitant numerical computations are carried out              
              to study details of deexcitation dynamics, including                           
              relativistic effects.  The second topic comprises the application              
              of formal time-independent scattering theory to describe the                   
              interaction of an atomic electron with a very strong elliptically              
              polarized electromagnetic field, with special attention to above-              
              threshold ionization.
