Abstract    :
              This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface                    
              chemistry and in the subfield of mass spectrometry.  Professor                 
              McLafferty of Cornell University will continue his breakthrough                
              work on neutralization reionization mass spectrometry (NRMS).                  
              Using NRMS unusual neutral species (biradicals, carbenes,                      
              ylides, hypervalent species and clusters) will be prepared and                 
              the energy surfaces of these molecules will be studied.  Laser                 
              photodissociation and luminescence detection will also be used                 
              to study the spectroscopic states of these unusual species.                    
                                                                                             
              Combining optical, mass spectrometric and energy release                       
              methods, ring opening and pyrolysis reactions of these small                   
              molecules of unusual electronic and molecular structure will be                
              probed.  Details of fragmentation mechanisms specific to                       
              isomeric species will be a particular focus of this work.
