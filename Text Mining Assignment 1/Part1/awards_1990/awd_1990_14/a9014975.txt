Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant explores quantitative approaches to the analysis of                 
              small regions less than one nanometer in the scanning                          
              transmission electron microscope.  In this renewal of the                      
              research the investigators continue their quantitative                         
              interpretation of microdiffraction data combined with recent                   
              advances in scanning transmission electron microscope.                         
              Nanocrystals, layered materials, and particle/network structures               
              are subject to analysis by scanning transmission electron                      
              microscope techniques.  Improved instrumentation and techniques                
              for characterizing small particles and thin films should result                
              as well as advancing understanding of the nature of catalysts.
