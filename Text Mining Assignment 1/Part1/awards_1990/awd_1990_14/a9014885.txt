Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Changes in membrane fluidity at low, but non-freezing temperatures, are        
              thought to be involved in chilling injury, a physiological disorder            
              that effects many economically important plants.  Recent research has          
              shown that the chilling sensitivity of some susceptible plant tissue is        
              reduced by exposure to ethanol, a mild anesthetic.  Some anesthetics           
              are known to increase membrane fluidity and thereby lower the                  
              temperature at which cold-induced phase transition occurs.  In                 
              contrast, elevated atmospheric gas pressures reduce membrane fluidity          
              and raise the temperature at which cold-induced phase transition               
              occurs.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Singular and combined effects of anesthetics and high-pressure gas             
              atmospheres on symptoms of chilling injury (induced ion leakage,               
              stimulated respiration, and stimulated ethylene production) will be            
              examined in seedlings.  Results will provide an understanding of how           
              these two factors can be used to manipulate chilling response and              
              ultimately an experimental approach to dissection of the mechanisms            
              that lead to plant adaptation to chilling temperatures.
