Abstract    :
                   This grant will support completion of the data analysis                   
              and publication of all results from Experiment E710 at                         
              Fermilab, (pp elastic scattering and total cross sections at                   
              energies up to  s = 1.8 TeV).  During the second and third                     
              years of the grant the group will start a new experiment to                    
              improve the measurement of the ratio of real to imaginary                      
              forward scattering amplitude at the full energy of the Fermilab                
              Tevatron, as well, as a much improved measurement of the total                 
              cross section.  A small group of physicists, consisting of one                 
              faculty member, one research associate and one student, is                     
              continuing its research in elementary particle physics.
