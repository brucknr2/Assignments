Abstract    :
              Description:  This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr.                  
              Deborah Goodings, University of Maryland and Dr. Erol Guler,                   
              University of Bogazici.  Project funding will allow Dr. Guler to               
              spend eight months in Dr. Goodings laboratory in order to                      
              collaborate on a series of geotechnical centrifuge models                      
              investigating the effects on geotextile reinforced retaining                   
              walls.  Research results may bring about new design techniques                 
              for less expensive construction of retaining walls.                            
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This proposal will bring together research scientists                  
              from the universities of two countries working in the area of                  
              geotechnical centrifuge models.  It is anticipated that this                   
              collaborative research will result in the development of new                   
              design techniques for retaining walls.  Dr. Guler will have an                 
              opportunity to familiarize himself with research equipment that                
              is presently not available in his university.  Therefore, this                 
              proposal fulfils objectives of the Science in Developing                       
              Countries Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific                   
              knowledge through an international collaboration.
