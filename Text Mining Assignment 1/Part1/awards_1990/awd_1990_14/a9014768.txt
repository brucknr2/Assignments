Abstract    :
                   The PI proposes to determine the spatial and temporal                     
              variation of the chemical content of snow and ice in central Asia              
              in order to improve our understanding of the distribution of                   
              chemical species in the atmosphere in this region, and their                   
              variation over space and time.  He plans to collect snow and ice               
              samples within the accumulation areas of eight to ten different                
              central Asian glaciers from snowpits six meters deep and ice                   
              cores drilled up to twenty meters.  The samples will be analyzed               
              for chloride, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, bromide, fluoride,                  
              sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, iron, oxygen and              
              hydrogen isotopes, 7Be, 210Pb, 137Cs, selected trace metals                    
              acetate, formate, methyl sulfonic acid, hydrogen peroxide,                     
              dissolved organic carbon, and microparticles.1
