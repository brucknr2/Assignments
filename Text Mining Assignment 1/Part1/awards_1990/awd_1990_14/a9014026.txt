Abstract    :
              This SGER research will be directed to answering fundamental,                  
              scientific matters concerning the control of orientation of                    
              polymer molecules on surfaces and the chemical and physical                    
              properties of such surface-bound polymer layers.  Specific                     
              questions upon which attention will be focused are:  How can the               
              directionality implicit in a surface be preserved in the                       
              orientation of a bound polymer at substantial distances from the               
              underlying?  What are the unique properties of such bound layers               
              as contrasted with both the solution and solid (but not uniquely               
              oriented) states?  How are the properties of such materials                    
              altered by the presence of other molecules, and are such changes               
              reversible, at if so, at what rate?  This fundamental science                  
              program is intended to gather the necessary seed information upon              
              which potential applications applications in optical switches and              
              molecular sensors can be built.
