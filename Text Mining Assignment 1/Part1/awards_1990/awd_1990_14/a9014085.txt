Abstract    :
                   Analog tape records of the electric fields of lightning                   
              flashes, which occurred during seventeen Florida thunderstorms,                
              will be analyzed for statistical properties of various lightning               
              processes.  We will digitize data from our analog tape records;                
              particular attention will be paid to:  (1) microsecond-scale                   
              pulses associated with continuing current, K-processes, M-                     
              components, preliminary breakdown, and leaders in negative ground              
              flashes, (2) the shapes of M-component field changes in negative               
              ground flashes, (3) the characteristics of ground flashes that                 
              can be used to predict the presence of continuing current, (4)                 
              positive flashes to earth, and (5) microsecond-scale pulses in                 
              cloud flashes.  Lightning models will be derived or modified                   
              based on the results of the analyses.
