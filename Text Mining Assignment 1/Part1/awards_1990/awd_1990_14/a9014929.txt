Abstract    :
                   The Snowbird conference has been held biennially at                       
              Snowbird, Utah in the summer of each even-numbered year since                  
              1974.  The Conference provides a forum in which the                            
              administrators of the Ph.D-granting academic computing                         
              departments, research laboratory managers, representatives from                
              government agencies, and other interested parties can meet to                  
              explore and discuss issues important to the development of                     
              computing research.  The 1990 Snowbird Conference will be                      
              consistent with this mission.                                                  
                   The Computing Research Board (CRB) is inviting six resource               
              persons from non-member academic institutions to serve on panels               
              and as workshop leaders on such topics as Human Resources                      
              (increasing the involvement of underrepresented groups in                      
              computer research), Educational Pipelines issues, and Curriculum               
              improvement.  Also, invited will be four representatives from                  
              Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  The latter              
              invitees could increase their awareness on the issues relating to              
              computing research and provide insight into mechanisms for                     
              increasing minority representation in computing research for the               
              other participants at Snowbird.                                                
                   The Conference is being held July 8-10, 1990 in Snowbird,                 
              Utah
