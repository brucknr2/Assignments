Abstract    :
              A critical stage in the advanced evolution of stars like the Sun               
              occurs as they rapidly shed the mass of their envelopes to become              
              dying white dwarf stars.   Radiation from the hot white dwarf                  
              remnant star excites the ejected material as it slowly leaves the              
              vicinity.  The result is an object called a "planetary nebula",                
              which is visible only in certain specific wavelengths.  The                    
              Principal Investigator will continue previous work in analyzing the            
              strengths of spectral "emission lines" to determine the chemical               
              abundances of the material in eight planetary nebulae in order to              
              understand the sequence of nuclear reactions that occurred in the              
              interior of their central stars prior to their creation by                     
              ejection.   The PI will make use of a modern solid-state array                 
              detector (CCD) with a new echelle spectrograph on the three-meter              
              telescope at Lick Observatory to enable him to measure many lines              
              too weak to be measured in previous studies.  Also, the PI will                
              utilize up-to-date model atmosphere computations to permit him to              
              synthesize the abundance results from all these data into a self-              
              consistent picture of the element abundances.  This study will                 
              provide new information on the effects of density variations,                  
              geometry, and chemical abundance variations within the observed                
              nebulae.
