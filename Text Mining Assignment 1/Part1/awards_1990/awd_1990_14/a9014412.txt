Abstract    :
              Dr. T. Y. Cao, working under the direction of Professor                        
              Schweber, is examining the history of the renormalization                      
              program in quantum field theory (QFT), covering the period                     
              form the early 1950's to the beginning of the 1980's--that is,                 
              from the work of Dyson and Salam that completed the initial                    
              phase of the renormalization theory to the formulation of the                  
              notion of effective field theories by Weinberg, Georgi and                     
              others.  Drs. Cao and Schweber hope to demonstrate that with                   
              the changing understanding of the physics of renormalization                   
              came a new conceptualization of quantum field theory, both                     
              with respect to its global structural pattern and to its                       
              status as a fundamental or phenomenological framework, thereby                 
              providing a basis for the proper understanding of the history                  
              of quantum field theory and of elementary particle physics.                    
              The emphasis in this research will be on the advances in                       
              understanding the physics and the philosophy of                                
              renormalization in the context of the interplay between                        
              quantum field theory, S-matrix theory and high energy physics,                 
              and that of the standard model of electroweak and strong                       
              interactions.
