Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to request partial funding for a sum of                       
              $10,000 for the Fourth International Conference on Surface                     
              Modification Technologies that is to be held in Paris, France                  
              between 6-9 November 1990.  The purpose of this annual                         
              conference is to bring together diverse experts, researchers                   
              and scientists from interdisciplinary areas ranging from the                   
              basic sciences to practical industrialists and end users for                   
              the various surface technologies.  Surface Modification is                     
              one of the key areas that will increase the "Competitiveness"                  
              of American industry as it is a vital ingredient in both the                   
              manufacturing and remanufacturing sector.
