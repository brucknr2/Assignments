Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The computer graphics metafile interpreter GPLOT, produced at PSC,             
              has been extremely successful with over 150 copies transmitted to              
              users.  The basic system is very stable, but there is a continued              
              need for maintenance and further development, driven by the advent of          
              both new output devices and official extensions to the CGM (Computer           
              Graphics Metafile) standard.  The proposal effort will address recent          
              new addenda to the present ANSI CGM standard, and incorporate two new          
              devices in the GPLOT driver interface.
