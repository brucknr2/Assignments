Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under this award Professor Isao Ishibashi, Department of                       
              Civil Engineering, Old Dominion University, will spend 12                      
              months conducting research at the Port and Harbour Research                    
              Institute, Ministry of Transport, Yokosuka, Japan.  His                        
              counterparts are Drs. Setsuo Noda and Tatsuo Uwabe.                            
                                                                                             
              Shaking table experiments will be conducted in order to                        
              investigate the validity of the "generalized apparent seismic                  
              coefficient" theory, developed by the principal investigator                   
              and coworkers, which may be used to estimate dynamic soil and                  
              water pressures against marine retaining structures under                      
              stress by adequately taking into account the role of liquified                 
              backsoil and pore water on dynamic lateral earth pressure.                     
              These investigations will utilize the excellent shaking table                  
              facilities of the seismic damage records.  This work will                      
              contribute to the design of safer port facilities and marine                   
              structures.  The visit will commence on January 1, 1992.
