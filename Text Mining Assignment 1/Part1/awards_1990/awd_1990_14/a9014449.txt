Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Brazil Science and Technology Initiative (STI) award                 
              will transfer $75,000 to the Department of Energy, as agreed to                
              under the Joint Plan for Basic Science approved by the NSF and the             
              Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq).  Under this plan and for           
              the purposes of the STI, the area of physics will be coordinated               
              by the Department of Energy.  This transfer will help to support               
              research visits and exchanges of physicists to U.S. and Brazilian              
              national laboratories.
