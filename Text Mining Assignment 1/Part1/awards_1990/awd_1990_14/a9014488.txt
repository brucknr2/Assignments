Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Gellman                    
              will evaluate the contribution made by hydrogen bonds that                     
              involve amide groups toward determining the overall                            
              conformational stability of globular proteins. The project                     
              utilizes small, flexible molecules that contain a limited                      
              number of amide groups to dissect the contribution of this one                 
              particular class of non-covalent interaction. Results obtained                 
              from this work are expected to afford increased understanding                  
              of the factors that determine three-dimensional protein                        
              structure and, accordingly, that direct the biological function                
              (enzymatic, regulatory or structural) of a globular protein.                   
                                                                                             
              Conformational preferences in the various model systems will be                
              studied spectroscopically under conditions in which internal                   
              hydrogen bonds are energetically significant. Conformational                   
              preferences observed in a series of closely related oligoamides                
              should provide information about the manner in which hydrogen                  
              bond strength is affected by the spatial orientation of the                    
              bonding partners. This analysis also should reveal the manner                  
              in which hydrogen bonds are affected by other internal                         
              non-covalent interactions, and also how they are affected by                   
              the environment (e.g., solvent).
