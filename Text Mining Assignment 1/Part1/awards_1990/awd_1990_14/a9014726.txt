Abstract    :
              This award will support the research of Dr. Malcolm Forbes at                  
              the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The award is                  
              the starter grant portion of Dr. Forbes Postdoctoral Research                  
              Fellowship in Chemistry and deals with the matrix isolation and                
              characterization of reactive intermediates prepared by                         
              gas-phase photolysis.                                                          
                                                                                             
              With the modification of a recently developed Electron                         
              Paramagnetic Resonance/Matrix Isolation apparatus and the use                  
              of well-established gas-phase photochemistry, a series of small                
              alkyl biradicals and rigid, caged adamantyl biradicals will be                 
              investigated.  Information regarding structure, reactivity and                 
              spin multiplicity will be obtained.  Application of mass                       
              spectrometric and optical techniques will provide kinetic and                  
              structural analyses.  Molecular orbital calculations will be                   
              performed on many of the compounds and intermediates proposed                  
              for study.
