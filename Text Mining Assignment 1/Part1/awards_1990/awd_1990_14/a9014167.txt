Abstract    :
              An experimental search for theoretically predicted plasma wave                 
              instabilities in devices consisting of a superconducting layer of              
              YBCO separated from a superconducting layer of niobium by a thin               
              insulating layer is proposed.  Theoretical work has shown that                 
              when the relative drift velocity between the parallel                          
              superconducting layers is large, an amplified plasma mode may                  
              exist, and can lose energy by electromagnetic radiation.  This                 
              effect is similar to the 'two-beam plasma instability' for two-                
              component collisionless plasmas.  The research is to search for                
              this effect by a) studying the current-voltage characteristics                 
              when a relative drift velocity exists between the two layers, and              
              b) using bolometric detectors at low temperatures to detect the                
              emitted radiation.  The effect may have a long-term practical                  
              application in the design of generators of nearly monochromatic                
              long-wavelength electromagnetic radiation.
