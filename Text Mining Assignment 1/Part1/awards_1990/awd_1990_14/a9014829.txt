Abstract    :
              This is the 1st year funding of a 3 year continuing award.  This               
              research is to develop a new, model-based, spectral estimation                 
              algorithm for recognition of noisy speech.  The new algorithm                  
              represents a significant improvement over previous estimation                  
              algorithms because it incorporates more information about speech               
              spectral distribution.  The proposed work improves the estimation              
              by incorporating information about its dynamic properties and its              
              quasi-periodic nature.  To capture the dynamic properties the                  
              research will study several types of hidden Markov models.  An                 
              estimation of the position of the harmonics will be made to                    
              address the periodicity properties.  From these will be made an                
              estimate of the spectral energy at any given frequency dependent               
              on its proximity to the nearest harmonic.  Incorporation of                    
              dynamics and periodicity should improve speech recognition                     
              performance in noisy environments.
