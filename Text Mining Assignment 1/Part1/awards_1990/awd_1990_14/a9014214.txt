Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Materials Chemistry and Chemical                     
              Processing Initiative in support of the collaborative research                 
              of Professors Thiel and Evans at Iowa State University. Joint                  
              funding is provided by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials                
              Research. The thrust of the research is an investigation of the                
              diffusion-limited structure of metal films on metal substrates                 
              in the low-temperature regime, where thermal diffusion within                  
              the film is slow and film structure is strongly influenced by                  
              characteristics of the adsorption event.                                       
                                                                                             
              Sophisticated models for film growth will be developed, using a                
              unique combination of molecular dynamics simulations and Monte                 
              Carlo simulations and/or rate equation analyses which yield                    
              statistical quantities which can be compared to experimental                   
              data. Typical systems to be studied are high-surface free                      
              energy metals such as iron or nickel on low-surface free energy                
              metals such as silver or gold. Experimentally, two main                        
              complementary techniques, low-energy electron diffraction and                  
              scanning tunneling microscopy will be employed.
