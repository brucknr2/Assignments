Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A high quality Utraviolet-Visible-Near Infrared Spectrometer is a              
              vital piece of equipment for measuring electronic spectra of                   
              complexes and simple compounds.  The spectra provide insight into              
              the nature and extent of the electronic interactions involved.                 
              The spectrometer is used for kinetic studies and studies of                    
              surfaces.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Instrumentation Program to the                   
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Wyoming will help                 
              acquire an UV-VIS-NIR Spectrometer with an Integrating Sphere.                 
              The acquisition will enhance the ability of the department to                  
              educate undergraduate students and will enhance chemical research              
              in the following areas:
