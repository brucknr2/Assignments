Abstract    :
                   Research will be carried out in high energy electron                      
              scattering at SLAC.  The principal focus will be on experiments                
              which probe the quark substructure of nucleons and few nucleon                 
              systems.  Part of the research activities will be to coordinate                
              the Nuclear Physics at SLAC program and facilitate experiments                 
              in SLAC End Station A.
