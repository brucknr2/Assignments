Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Although standard Unix permits applications to be "piped"                      
              together, the standard syntax has functional and practical                     
              limitations.  Visual pipes will eliminate some of these                        
              restrictions, i.e., they will provide a graphical,  mouse driven               
              interface, and allow for multiple inputs and outputs from each                 
              application.  The generality of the tool, due to its Unix base,                
              would make it applicable to not only the IBM systems at CNSF, but              
              also to other supercomputers or parallel machines which are                    
              front ended by Unix machines.
