Abstract    :
              Biomechanics is a field of applied mechanics which has                         
              application to many areas, including physiology, medicine,                     
              surgery, biotechnology, bioprocess engineering, and                            
              virtually all facets of health care technology.  As a                          
              result, the various research projects worked on by                             
              biomechanicians represent a widely scattered and diverse                       
              set of topics, but ones held together by a certain                             
              universality in the basic principles of mechanics being                        
              applied.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              With this in mind, the specific aims of this 3rd U.S.                          
              China-Japan Conference on Biomechanics is to provide a                         
              forum for the following:                                                       
                                                                                             
              l.  to review and compare progress in these three                              
                  countries in the field of biomechanics;                                    
                                                                                             
              2.  to assess future directions for biomechanics research                      
                  in each country;                                                           
                                                                                             
              3.  to encourage the development of collaborative                              
                  biomechanics research of a binational type; and                            
                                                                                             
              4.  to foster relationships between biomechanicians in the                     
                  three countries so as to facilitate the above.
