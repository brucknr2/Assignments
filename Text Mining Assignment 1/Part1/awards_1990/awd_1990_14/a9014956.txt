Abstract    :
                   The defoliation of montane cloud forest in Puerto Rico by a               
              recent hurricane offers an opportunity to investigate the                      
              influence of canopy structure on the deposition of material from               
              the atmosphere and the chemical processing of that material                    
              before it reaches the forest floor.  Drs. Lovett and Asbury                    
              hypothesize that: 1. As the canopy recovers, cloud water                       
              deposition will first increase in response to increasing surfaces              
              for deposition, and then decrease as the canopy becomes dense                  
              enough to limit penetration of wind and cloud droplets.  2. The                
              canopy will take up NO3-, NH4+, and H+ and release all other                   
              ions.  The amount of uptake or release will increase rapidly in                
              the initial stages of recovery and then level off at higher                    
              levels of canopy surface areas.  3. Because of the abundance of                
              chemically active epiphytes on boles and branches, stemflow                    
              chemistry will change more than throughfall chemistry as the                   
              canopy recovers.                                                               
                   This innovative research takes advantage of a natural                     
              catastrophe to investigate the properties of forest canopy-                    
              atmosphere interaction.  This is an important area of research                 
              for global change and atmospheric deposition.  Drs. Lovett and                 
              Asbury are highly qualified investigators who have experience                  
              with sampling and modeling canopy-atmosphere interactions.
