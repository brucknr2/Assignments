Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Proposed research involves theoretical study of stable, spatially              
              inhomogeneous, vibrational excitations in periodic but anharmonic              
              lattices.  Detailed analytic studies and molecular dynamics                    
              computer simulations will be used.  The second part of the proposal            
              concerns the solid state defect system KI:Ag+. Investigated will be            
              the possible role played by the intrinsic anharmonic resonance                 
              modes.  Other studies on this system are also proposed.
