Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The mechanisms by which endocytic vesicles form and by which                   
              vesicle formation is regulated are not understood in any                       
              biological system.  The proposed SGER is directed at                           
              understanding these phenomena by taking advantage of the                       
              temperature sensitive recessive mutation, shibire, in Drosophila.              
              At 30 degrees C coated visicle formation and endocytosis are                   
              stopped within 1-2 minutes in flies homozygous for the mutation.               
              Resumption of uptake occurs within 1-2 minutes after return to 22              
              degrees C.  Wild type Drosophila exhibit normal uptake and                     
              vesicle formation at both 22 and 30 degrees C.  Such rapid onset               
              and reversal in the mutants suggests that a protein                            
              intrinsic to vesicle formation is the target of the shibire                    
              mutation.  P element transposon mutagenesis will be used to                    
              identify and mark the wild type shibire gene.  Portions of the                 
              wild type shibire gene will then be used to identify and isolate               
              both genomic and cDNA clones of the wild type shibire gene.                    
                                                                                             
              Receptor-mediated endocytosis is an important step in the traffic              
              of cellular membranes and a fundamental cellular function that is              
              closely associated with the ability of cells to receive and                    
              respond to chemical signals.  If this project is successful it                 
              will be the first isolation of any gene involved in endocytic                  
              vesicle formation during receptor-mediated endocytosis.  This                  
              should then permit the identification, characterization, and                   
              localization of one or more of the cellular constituents which                 
              control this critical step in cellular membrane traffic.
