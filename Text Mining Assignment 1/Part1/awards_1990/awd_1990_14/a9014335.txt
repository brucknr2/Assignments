Abstract    :
              The goal of this research program is to provide exact analyses of              
              over-sampled A/Ds, especially a variety of architectures for                   
              implementing a method known as sigma-delta modulation.  Through the            
              use of old and new techniques from nonlinear and linear systems                
              theory, random processes, and ergodic theory, exact descriptions               
              of the behavior of quantization noise for single-loop and multi-               
              stage (cascaded) sigma-delta modulatory architectures for a variety            
              of input signals (both with and without dithering) have been                   
              obtained.  The thrust of the present proposal will be to extend                
              these results to other architectures including a sigma-delta loop              
              with leaky integrators and non-unity gain, modulo sigma-delta and              
              parallel sigma-delta modulatory.  Also, if time permits, other                 
              related topics will be examined including stability issues in                  
              feedback quantization, and the incorporation of subsequent signal              
              processing (such as compression and linear filtering) into the A/D             
              converter.
