Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Given a geometry, electronic structure may be calculated for even              
              very complex materials within the local density approximation.                 
              However, geometrical sturctures of very complex materials or                   
              disordered systems are often not known.  A major step toward the               
              achievement of first principle predictions of the structural and               
              dynamical properties of very complex materials has been made                   
              possible by the Car-Parrinello method of ab intio molecular                    
              dynmics stimulation.  While this approach when implemented on                  
              supercomputers allows the simulation of many interesting problems              
              of even more importance are still to large. On the otherhand,                  
              the appearance of the massively parallel processor architecture                
              of the machine is taken into account.  Preliminary testing of                  
              Car-Parrinello simulation on the Connection Machine indicates                  
              that it maps well onto parallel architectures.  Provided that the              
              code is fully optimized for the Connection Machine it will be                  
              possible to predict strutural and dynamical properties of complex              
              materials form first principles.  Examples would include                       
              simulation of surface oxidation, molecular/cluster interaction                 
              with surfaces and ab initio studies of scanning tunnel microscope              
              and atom force microscope images.
