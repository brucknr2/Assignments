Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research develops the understanding of fatigue crack growth               
              in stage I for "load" control.  Copper single crystals are                     
              selected as the specimen material because of the well-categorized              
              behavior of the material under prior strain control experiments.               
              Dislocation substructure stability and strain partitioning are                 
              examined under load control testing.  Considerations include how               
              variable loading influences the development of local strain and                
              Stage I crack growth.  The results will be used to form a model                
              of damage accumulation for estimating fatigue lifetimes.
