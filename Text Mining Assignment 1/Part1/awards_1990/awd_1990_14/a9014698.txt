Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will support one                     
              summer of computer vision research by Dr. Oliensis, a                          
              mathematical physicist, in collaboration with Allen Hanson,                    
              Associate Director of the Computer Vision Laboratory at the                    
              University of Massachusetts.  Dr. Oliensis has discovered                      
              interesting qualitative properties of the shape from shading                   
              problem, implying the existence of robust algorithms for unique                
              recovery of physical surface shape from gray scale imagery.  This              
              grant will support software implementation needed for                          
              experimental verification and for investigation beyond the                     
              restricted imaging models of the current theory.
