Abstract    :
                   It is well known that neutral atoms or molecules of various               
              origins, e.g. interstellar, cometary, or planetary, exist                      
              pervasively in interplanetary space.  When these neutral                       
              particles get sufficiently close to the Sun, they can be ionized,              
              for example by solar ultraviolet radiation.  Consequently, the                 
              freshly created ions would interact with the moving solar wind.                
              In recent years, research in this topic area has been spurred by               
              in site observations at comets Giacobini-Zinner and Halley and                 
              attracted considerable interest and attention from the scientific              
              community. I this work, a series of theoretical studies will be                
              conducted relating to ion creation and structure in the solar                  
              wind.  These include (1) further studies of ion pickup and                     
              subsequent development in a solar wind, (2) problems relevant to               
              the stability and thermalization of ions in a pickup state, (3)                
              and possible processes leading to assimilation of the newborn                  
              ions by the solar wind.  Both analytical theory and numerical                  
              simulation techniques will be used in the proposed studies.  ***
