Abstract    :
                   Theoretical studies of photoionization on atomic systems                  
              are proposed which are an extension of the authors previous                    
              work.  An important part of the proposal is the development of                 
              computer codes which will incorporate relativistic effects into                
              the many body perturbation theory (MBPT) approach used                         
              previously and will thus make possible an analysis of these                    
              effects in MBPT calculations of photoionization.
