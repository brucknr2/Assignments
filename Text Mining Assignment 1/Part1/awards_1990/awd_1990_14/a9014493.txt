Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Sensory capabilities can be measured quite precisely by an                     
              experimental approach called psychophysics, in which the subject               
              reports whether or not a particular stimulus signal is                         
              detectable.  Most psychophysical work on human subjects involves               
              visual or auditory stimuli.  A variety of precisely quantified                 
              stimulus parameters can be varied, and the subject's threshold                 
              for detection measured or computed as a probability of correct                 
              response.  This Accomplishment Based Renewal will investigate a                
              class of psychophysical tests called adaptive procedures, with                 
              the goal of improving the efficiency of such tests, which                      
              otherwise can require very large numbers of stimulus                           
              presentations to obtain reliable results.  Many of the new                     
              techniques make specific assumptions about the nature of the                   
              sensory processes.  This work will test these assumptions to see               
              if they are valid, and to see if the new methods may                           
              substantially improve the measurement efficiency.  Results will                
              have impact on visual and auditory science, and on related areas               
              of work on signal detection processing, and sensory psychology.
