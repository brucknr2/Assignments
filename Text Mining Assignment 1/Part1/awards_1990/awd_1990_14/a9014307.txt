Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The focus of this proposal is on providing the tools and                       
              environment for acquiring application and system performance                   
              data.  A set of system performance monitoring  tools will be                   
              developed and implemented which will allow the CNSF technical                  
              staff to monitor a single user application, groups of virtual                  
              machines, or all virtual machines currently running on the                     
              system.
