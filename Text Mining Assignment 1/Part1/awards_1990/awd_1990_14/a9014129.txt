Abstract    :
                   A series of computer simulation studies is carried out with               
              the objective of establishing the feasibility of demonstrating                 
              and studying an electron-positron plasma.  Such a plasma has                   
              been assumed to be unrealizable and would have unique properties               
              of fundamental interest.
