Abstract    :
              This research project will make use of Brillouin and Raman                     
              scattering to investigate the incommensurate and lock-in phase                 
              transitions in several dielectric crystals.  The specific                      
              projects include:  1) studies of the longitudinal acoustic                     
              anomalies in potassium selenate near the characteristic                        
              temperature TI and controversial asymmetries in transverse                     
              acoustic modes in potassium selenate and                                       
              tetramethyltetrachlorozincate; 2) clearing up the remaining                    
              controversy concerning the dielectric anomaly in thiourea with                 
              Brillouin scattering; 3) studies of the glass transition with                  
              lithium chloride solutions and other glass-forming materials; 4)               
              a new study of surface acoustic modes of crystals near the                     
              melting point in order to search for the onset of surface                      
              melting.
