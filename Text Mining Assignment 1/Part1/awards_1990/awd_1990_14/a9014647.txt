Abstract    :
              This project analyzes the design, transfer, and use of                         
              programmable automation in selected U.S. producer and end-user                 
              establishments in the machine tool/metalworking sector and among               
              purchaser firms of such products.  Case studies of 30 firms will               
              be conducted to evaluate a set of hypotheses about discrete                    
              chains of production.  The study will identify specific inter-                 
              firm linkages that influence the design process and design                     
              strategies, a crucial nexus in more extensive chains of                        
              production.
