Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Dr. Jack Saltiel at Florida State                           
              University.  Knowledge gained from this research will provide                  
              an improved understanding of complex light-initiated phenomena                 
              such as the visual process.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Dr. Saltiel's research will focus on the photochemistry of                     
              olefins, arenes, and aromatic ketones.  The major area will be                 
              a detailed study of olefin photoisomerization, including the                   
              effects of solvent polarity, the mechanism of nonvertical                      
              triplet and singlet energy transfer, and the use of                            
              conformationally rigid analogs to evaluate ground state                        
              conformational control of the photochemical and photophysical                  
              events.  Principal component analysis with self-modeling will                  
              be employed to resolve complex spectra into the contributions                  
              of individual conformers.
