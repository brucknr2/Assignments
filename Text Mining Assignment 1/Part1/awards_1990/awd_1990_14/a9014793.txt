Abstract    :
              High performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) offers                       
              important advantages over conventional gel electrophoresis in the              
              characterization of proteins and nucleic acids.  It is much                    
              faster than the gels and can be fully automated and instrumented               
              with sample injection, detection and collection.  In addition,                 
              HPCE can separate solutes with a resolution which is one to two                
              orders of magnitude greater than high performance liquid                       
              chromatography (HPLC) using sample sizes four orders of magnitude              
              smaller than HPLC.                                                             
                                                                                             
              However, single-capillary HPCE can only handle solutes loadings                
              of less than 1 ug.  It cannot be used at preparatory scales to                 
              provide material for further analysis, clinical research or                    
              therapeutic application.  Most scientists familiar with this                   
              technology believe that, if HPCE could be scaled to preparative                
              levels, it would become an indispensable laboratory tool.                      
              Unfortunately, scale-up to preparative HPCE is not simple:  a                  
              preparative HPCE column must dissipate Joule heat effectively                  
              while maintaining the extraordinarily high plate efficiency                    
              routinely observed in ug. HPCE.                                                
                                                                                             
              To reach the goal of 1 mg HPCE, a study is proposed which                      
              combines both theoretical and experimental analyses of single and              
                                                                                             
              multiple capillary HPCE.  The objectives of this research are to               
              (1) elucidate the mechanisms of heat transfer, separation and                  
              dispersion in single capillaries and to apply this knowledge in                
              the (2) design of a preparative-scale HPCE column.
