Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, electron spectroscopic studies will be                     
              carried out which aim at understanding chemical effects on the                 
              behavior of excited molecular complexes.  In addition to its                   
              intrinsic scientific interest, this research has connections                   
              with site-selective X-ray photochemistry and could have                        
              applications in nanolithography and future generations of                      
              semiconductor device technology.                                               
                                                                                             
              Electron spectroscopy will be used to determine the energies                   
              needed to remove inner-shell electrons from small molecules in                 
              the gas phase and to study the dynamics and energetics of the                  
              processes by which these highly excited molecules lose their                   
              energy.  Also concerned with the dynamics of inner-shell                       
              de-excitation will be a theoretical and experimental study of                  
              the effects of molecular environment on the rate of Auger decay                
              in molecules containing carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine.
