Abstract    :
                   The objective of this industry internship project is to                   
              develop a computer based communication system to improve the                   
              integration and performance of product release and scheduling                  
              operations in electronics manufacturing.  The internship will be               
              carried out in collaboration with Universal Instruments.  A                    
              knowledge based approach will be used to develop the initial                   
              prototype.
