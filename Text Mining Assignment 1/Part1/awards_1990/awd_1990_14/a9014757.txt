Abstract    :
              This award will support a group of 8-10 Mexican students                       
              coming to the United States for a period of 2 months to visit                  
              leading American museums and universities in Orinthology.                      
              The proposed visits have been organized by Professor Frank B.                  
              Gill of the Academy of National Sciences of Philadelphia and                   
              Professor Jorge E. Llorente of the Musio de Zodogia of the                     
              Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.                                       
                                                                                             
              The proposed visits will enable a group of Mexican students                    
              to gather data from extensive collections of Mexican specimens                 
              not currently available in their country and to meet potential                 
              sponsors for graduate programs in biology in the United                        
              States.  The ultimate goal is to develop ties between the                      
              orinthology community in both countries that will be able to                   
              better utilize the extensive collections of Mexican specimens                  
              currently available in the U.S. and to promote greater                         
              efforts in biodiversity in Mexico.
