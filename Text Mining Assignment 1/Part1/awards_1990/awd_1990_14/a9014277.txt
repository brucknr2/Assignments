Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                  
              Training Group in Studies of Paleorecords of Global Change.  The               
              faculty group is a mixture of outstanding senior and junior                    
              investigators who come from a variety of disciplines.  The funds               
              will provide stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral                   
              fellows, will support research participation by high school and                
              undergraduate students, will defray part of the cost of the                    
              trainees' research and will enable the trainees to attend                      
              scientific meetings.  In addition, funds will be used to purchase              
              specialized research equipment to be used by trainees, and to bring            
              investigators from other research and academic institutions to the             
              Minnesota campus for workshops and symposia.                                   
                                                                                             
              There is now a significant need for the training of new researchers            
              skilled in study of the environment.  The use of new techniques                
              taken from a variety of physical and biological disciplines is                 
              revolutionizing studies both of the environment and of its                     
              variation over the course of time.  The quantitative analysis of               
              past changes in the environment, including the study of particular             
              ecosystems and their response to environmental stress, is of                   
              particular relevance to the current concerns about global change.
