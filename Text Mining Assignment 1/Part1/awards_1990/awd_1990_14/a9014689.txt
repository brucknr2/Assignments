Abstract    :
              An important area of current astronomical research concerns the                
              study of mass loss of red giant stars as they evolve to white                  
              dwarfs through the "planetary nebula" stage.  It is now believed               
              that this loss occurs as a wind of atomic particles.  The                      
              intensity of this wind increases over the course of several                    
              thousand years until the envelope of the star is peeled off in a               
              very fast wind at a rapid rate.  The Principal Investigator (PI)               
              proposes to continue previous studies of this phenomenon by using              
              a determining the amount of mass lost in this wind in a large                  
              sample of red giants from the strength of two carbon monoxide                  
              emission lines in the nebular material surrounding them.  The                  
              amounts of mass loss will be correlated against known stellar                  
              parameters such as stellar mass, luminosity, radius, and chemical              
              composition to permit an empirical model to be developed as to                 
              how mass is lost during this critical brief stage of evolution.
