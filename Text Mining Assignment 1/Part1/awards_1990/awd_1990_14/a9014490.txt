Abstract    :
              This grant will support research in differential geometry and                  
              nonlinear control theory to advance our understanding of motion                
              planning for nonholonomic systems.  Nonholonomic problems arise                
              in mobile robot navigation, rolling contacts and robotic                       
              grasping, free-floating robots in space or underwater, and                     
              control of legged robots.
