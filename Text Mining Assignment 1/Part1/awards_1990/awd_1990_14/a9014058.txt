Abstract    :
              Sakallah         This research is on the temporal modeling of latch-  controlled
              synchronous digital systems.  The use of level-  sensitive latches, as opposed
              to edge-triggered flip-flops, has  become quite common in recent years because
              latches are easily  implemented in MOS VLSI, the leading technology for
              building  digital systems.  A consistent theoretical framework for  describing
              the timing constraints which must be satisfied by such  systems for proper
              operation is being developed.  This framework  is being used to develop
              efficient algorithms for timing  verification and optimal clocking.        
              Both of these problems require the solution of large linear  programs (LPs). 
              The special structures of these LPs will be  utilized to reduce the solution
              time so that the algorithms can  be used in an interactive design environment. 
              The practical  significance of this framework and associated algorithms is
              being  assessed experimentally on actual industrial VLSI designs.
