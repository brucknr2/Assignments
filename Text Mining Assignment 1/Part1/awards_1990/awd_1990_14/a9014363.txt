Abstract    :
                   This project attacks the process control problems using a formal          
              method for program derivation that is based on Hoare-style proof               
              outlines.  This involves investigations into formal methods for                
              reasoning about real-time and fault-tolerance.  It also involves               
              applying the resulting methodology to actual process control problems,         
              leading to improved notations and techniques for suppressing                   
              irrelevant details when deriving moderate-sized concurrent and                 
              distributed programs.
