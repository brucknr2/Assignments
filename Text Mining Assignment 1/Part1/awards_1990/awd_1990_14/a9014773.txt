Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Science in Developing Countries award will help to                        
              support an international symposium on "The Biology and                         
              Conservation of Epiphytes" at Marie Selby Botanical Gardens.                   
              An international group of botanists, ecologists, conservation                  
              biologists, and horticulturists will convene for four days of                  
              papers, round-table discussions, and public lectures on                        
              aspects of epiphyte biology and conservation.  The meeting                     
              will foster exchange of information across lines of individual                 
              disciplines, geographical areas, and plant taxa.  Special                      
              emphasis will be on conservation of epiphytic plant species                    
              and their habitats:  speakers will present reports of "case                    
              studies" of conservation activities where these plants are                     
              native and threatened.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Products from this Symposium will include a research                           
              publication of selected talks, a set of information pamphlets                  
              for the general public on aspects of epiphyte biology and                      
              conservation, a set of specific recommendations for the                        
              conservation of epiphytes and their habitats generated in the                  
              round-table discussions, a compilation of epiphyte-related                     
              literature, and a mailing list for future communication among                  
              those who study, cultivate, and conserve epiphytes.  Particular                
              emphasis will be placed on promoting international collabora-                  
              tion and information exchange with scientists from Latin                       
              America and other regions of the world with native epiphytes.
