Abstract    :
                   The requested equipment consists of a specially-designed,                 
              double-action, hydraulically-actuated machine that is suitable for             
              a variety of mechanical tests related to material forming                      
              operations.  The precise position sensors and special computer                 
              control technology can produce a variety of operating schedules,               
              thereby allowing the Hydraulic Forming Simulator to emulate many               
              kinds of standard testing machines, industrial presses, and other              
              mechanical devices while precisely controlling and recording loads,            
              rates, and positions.  The Hydraulic Forming Simulator will be used            
              by researchers involved in sheet forming, forging, polymer and                 
              composite forming, and material testing.  Its flexible design                  
              insures that it can serve for many years as a state-of-the-art                 
              mechanical testing platform for forming research.
