Abstract    :
                   This award enables Loyola College in Maryland to connect to               
              NSFNET through a 56,000 bit per second link to the mid-level                   
              network SURANET, the Southeastern Universities Research Association            
              Network.  Access to NSFNET provides the faculty and students with              
              access to supercomputers, data archives, a variety of network                  
              gateways, automated library catalogs, and a wide range of software.            
              Primary applications include file transfers, electronic mail                   
              communication between local and remote researchers, and remote                 
              login to and use of supercomputers and other research facilities.              
              The shared Loyola/College of Notre Dame Library will also be                   
              accessable to other users on the Internet.
