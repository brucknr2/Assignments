Abstract    :
              This award supports a visit by Dr. Glenn L. Schrader of Iowa                   
              State University to the University of New South Wales in                       
              Australia, to work with Dr. H.E. Curry-Hyde to provide new                     
              fundamental information concerning the mechanism of CO, CO2                    
              and H2 conversion to methanol using novel Raney Cu-Zn                          
              catalysts.  Despite the importance of methanol as a large-                     
              volume chemical intermediate--and the potentially enormous                     
              demand as an alternate liquid fuel or fuel additive--many                      
              uncertainties remain regarding the detailed catalytic                          
              mechanism for methanol synthesis.  New fundamental information                 
              concerning the reaction pathway would lead to improved                         
              methanol catalysts and processes.  The Australian researchers                  
              have discovered a unique series of highly active methanol                      
              catalysts based on a Raney-catalyst preparational technique.                   
              Two advanced spectroscopic techniques developed by the United                  
              States researchers for catalysts research--FTIR reflectance-                   
              absorbance spectroscopy (IRRAS) and laser Raman spectroscopy                   
              (LRS), including "surface-enhanced" approaches--will be used                   
              to examine Raney Cu-Zn catalysts which have been prepared,                     
              characterized, and evaluated for activity and selectivity by                   
              the Australian researchers.  These studies will contribute                     
              new information concerning the nature of adsorption and                        
              reaction on methanol synthesis catalysts and will lead to a                    
              more fundamental understanding of the nature of the active                     
              sites.  Specifically, the goals of these studies will be: (1)                  
              to determine the nature of CO2, CO, H2, and H2O adsorption of                  
              specific sites on the surfaces of the Raney Cu-Zn catalysts;                   
              (2) to examine the role of intermediates such as formates,                     
              formaldehyde, methoxy, or other surface species in methanol                    
              synthesis; and (3) to distinguish the differences in the                       
              mechanistic pathways for CO2 and CO conversion in methanol                     
              synthesis.
