Abstract    :
                   Food limitation in herbivorous zooplankton (Daphnia,                      
              Diaptomus, also rotifers and protozoa) will be assayed using a                 
              recently developed technique--amendments of natural diets by                   
              additions of custom formulated microparticles containing lipid                 
              and fatty acids or proteins of various amino acid compositions.                
                   Concurrent analyses of diet--as (1) food items ingested, (2)              
              biochemical composition of <30 um seston, (3) nutrient-                        
              limitations of ingestable algae, and (4) dietary deficiency                    
              effects on reproduction --will contrast spring ve summer                       
              conditions of nutrient--poor vs nutrient-rich lakes.  Researchers              
              focus field and laboratory experiments on potential compensation               
              mechanisms such as diet breadth vs selectivity, excess feeding,                
              omnivory and vertical migration as points of contrast between a                
              generalist grazer (Daphnia) and a more selective feeder                        
              (Diaptomus), and test the idea that the "microbial loop" is                    
              effectively though differently utilized by both strategies.
