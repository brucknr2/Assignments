Abstract    :
              Despite more than a decade of research into parallel computing                 
              systems, the development of such systems remains a difficult and               
              error-prone undertaking, owing to the subtle interactions in which             
              simultaneously executing components may engage.  One way to ensure             
              that such systems behave correctly is to verify them formally; this,           
              however, can be an extremely complex task, and even the development of         
              automated tools has not permitted very large systems to be proved              
              correct.  Using the framework of process algebra, the broad goal of            
              this project is to develop automated techniques that enable the                
              verification of large concurrent systems.  The project will work along         
              three lines.                                                                   
                                                                                             
                Methodologies will be developed that exploit the structure of                
                concurrent systems and their specifications to reduce the                    
                verification process to a collection of more manageable subproblems          
                that may be solved using existing techniques.                                
                                                                                             
                Automated tools that support these methodologies will be built on            
                top of an existing tool, the Concurrency Workbench, which provides           
                the basic support needed for the proposed techniques.                        
                                                                                             
                The utility of the methodologies and associated tools will be                
                evaluated by applying them to the verification of existing "real             
                world" communications protocols.
