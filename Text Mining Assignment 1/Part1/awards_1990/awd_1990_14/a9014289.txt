Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to an outstanding group of investigators             
              who study organismal structure with particular attention to that               
              of vertebrates.  The funds will be used to purchase microscopes,               
              video cameras and recorders, computers and specialized computer                
              software need for modern morphometric analysis.                                
                                                                                             
              Although the study of structure is a long established area of                  
              biological investigation, the recent remarkable progress in studies            
              of molecular and subcellular organization has somewhat eclipsed                
              studies of higher level organization at a time when the application            
              of computers has permitted increasingly sophisticated quantitative             
              morphology.  The coupling of video equipment to microscopes                    
              together with the use of computers for storage and analysis of the             
              video data has been the key element of progress in this area.  The             
              study of morphology continues to provide key insights into the how             
              and why of organismal evolution, and to out understanding of                   
              adaptation of species to their environments.  This award recognizes            
              the continuing importance of the study of morphology and of the                
              importance of modern instrumentation in these studies.
