Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              As the speed and memory size of supercomputers increase, the need              
              for file storage space also grows.  Simple scaling of current                  
              strategies can lead to solutions where the next generation                     
              machines require a greater expenditure for primary disks than for              
              the machine itself.  The proposed effort will adapt automatic                  
              file caching strategies, developed in a workstation environment,               
              for use in systems of high performance computers.
