Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI)                      
              project will explore the chemistry of metal oxide                              
              supported complexes containing bridged cyclo-pentadienyl                       
              and carbonyl ligands.  The investigators will also                             
              reexamine the use of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl metal                         
              complexes as reagents for the activation of small                              
              molecules.  The investigators are experienced in the                           
              synthesis of ligands and metal complexes and the infrared                      
              techniques that are involved in the process.  The                              
              preparation and characterization of supported                                  
              organometallic complexes are at the cutting edge of                            
              research in the area of heterogeneous catalysis.                               
                                                                                             
              This comprehensive investigation organometallic compounds                      
              will significantly increase the research capability of a                       
              predominantly minority institution and will provide                            
              innovative scientific techniques to its students in their                      
              professional development.
