Abstract    :
              Dr. Derek C. Jones of Hamilton College, New York, will visit                   
              Dr. Krastyu Petkov of the Institute of Sociology, Sofia, to                    
              develop a cooperative research project on alternative                          
              organizational structures and enterprise forms in Bulgaria.                    
              The resulting proposal is intended for consideration under                     
              the U.S.-Bulgaria Cooperative Science Program.  If successful,                 
              the project should yield new information on the economic                       
              effects of new firms in Bulgaria, especially on topics such                    
              as productivity, employment policies, and determinants of                      
              investment expenditure.
