Abstract    :
              One of the great challenges of computer science is the development of          
              correct programs for real applications.  The most critical real                
              applications often involve parallel processing, concurrency, and real          
              time.  These characteristics render current techniques of software             
              engineering less effective and emphasize the need for more formal              
              methods.  Graphical Interval Logic derived from S4.3 modal logic,              
              closely resembles the timing diagrams drawn by software engineers and,         
              thus, is highly intuitive and easy to use.  Specifications expressed           
              graphically for concurrent systems can be parsed into an internal              
              modal representation and submitted to a theorem prover to provide              
              rigorous confirmation of the intended properties of a program or               
              system design.  This project will develop an experimental                      
              implementation of Graphical Interval Logic with its associated                 
              specification database, parser, and theorem prover, and will                   
              investigate the application of the logic to the verification and               
              testing of Ada programs.  The tools will be designed in consultation           
              with industrial partners and will be evaluated by them for use in real         
              applications.
