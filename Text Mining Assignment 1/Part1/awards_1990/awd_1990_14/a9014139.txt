Abstract    :
              Under this Small Grant for Exploratory Research the Principal                  
              Investigator will design a special purpose spectrograph and                    
              explore observing methods for automated spectroscopic observing.               
              This could open a research technique to many smaller institutions              
              as well as make it much easier for researchers with synoptic                   
              requirements to obtain the needed spectroscopic data.
