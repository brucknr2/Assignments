Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Since the birth of Lifeline Earthquake                                         
              Engineering as an independent technical                                        
              discipline, only 20 years ago, as a result of                                  
              the San Fernando earthquake, it has become                                     
              increasingly evident that lifeline                                             
              engineering is vital to the welfare and                                        
              vitality of communities subject to earthquake                                  
              events.  The subject of lifeline engineering                                   
              involves safety, reliability, and related                                      
              applications of probabilistic analysis as                                      
              they relate to traditional engineering                                         
              principles such as structural, geotechnical,                                   
              and network analysis.  These interrelated and                                  
              interacting subjects make lifeline earthquake                                  
              engineering a complex subject area requiring                                   
              advanced techniques for development and                                        
              dissemination of theory and methods.                                           
                                                                                             
              This project is to provide travel funds nd                                     
              per diem costs for distinguished keynote                                       
              speakers at the Third U.S. Conference on                                       
              Lifeline Earthquake Engineering which will be                                  
              held at UCLA, in Los Angeles, California on                                    
              August 22-23, 1991, organized by the American                                  
              Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).  The                                        
              Lifeline Earthquake Engineering Conferences                                    
              are international in significance, and also                                    
              cover all technological areas with regard to                                   
              safety and reliability of lifelines subject                                    
              to earthquake hazards.  The Conference will                                    
              emphasize recent advances in Lifeline                                          
              Earthquake Engineering, and will contribute                                    
              to the development of new knowledge and                                        
              improved performance of lifelines which may                                    
              be subject to earthquakes.  Its goal is to                                     
              help establish methods of engineering                                          
              practice and policy for mitigating earthquake                                  
              effects on an infrastructure, and the                                          
              potential loss of property, human life, and                                    
              societal productivity arising from the                                         
              functional and physical failure of critical,                                   
              complex civil engineering systems due to                                       
              earthquake.
