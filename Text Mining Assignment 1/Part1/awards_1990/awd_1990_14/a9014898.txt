Abstract    :
              Professor Alvin L. Kwiram is supported by a Small Grant for                    
              Exploratory Research from the Experimental Physical Chemistry                  
              Program to investigate the potential for performing zero field                 
              electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy.  If he succeeds,                   
              this new technique will offer many unique advantages over                      
              conventional ESR methodologies for studying structure and                      
              dynamics of organic free radicals.                                             
                                                                                             
              Zero field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have                    
              been known for some time now.  The primary advantage over                      
              conventional NMR, which arises from increased sensitivity, is                  
              the capability of measuring small nuclear quadrupole coupling                  
              constants as well as very small splittings of spin half nuclei.                
              Kwiram plans to employ rapid electronic switching techniques to                
              implement field cycling for ESR.  Electronic switching is                      
              necessary rather than the mechanical methods employed in zero                  
              field NMR spectroscopy, because of the much shorter relaxation                 
              times encountered in typical ESR experiments.  If successful,                  
              the resulting zero field ESR should have a sensitivity                         
              enhancement over conventional methods of about two orders of                   
              magnitude.  This increased sensitivity will open up the                        
              possibility of a number of new experiments involving studies of                
              matrix isolated species and biological molecules.
