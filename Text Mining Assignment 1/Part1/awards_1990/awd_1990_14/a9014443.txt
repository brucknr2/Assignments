Abstract    :
                      The Herpetology Collection of the University of Texas,                 
              Arlington includes 60,000 catalogued specimens and approximately               
              350 type specimens.  The holdings have tripled in size over the                
              past decade, particularly in its representatives from central and              
              South America.  This collection is rapidly becoming one of the                 
              most important research resources in the country for studies of                
              tropical reptiles and amphibians.  Dr. Jonathan Campbell, Curator              
              of the collection, now proposes to initiate a computer database                
              of the collection.                                                             
                      The proposed database will increase the availability of                
              specimens in the collection for research and teaching.                         
              Investigators will have more immediate access to information                   
              concerning specimens, and the growth of the collection will be                 
              managed more effectively.  The maintenance and improvement of                  
              natural history collections such as this will assure that future               
              generations of biologists will have comprehensive data on the                  
              diversity of life on Earth.
