Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides continued support to Dr. Donald H. Berry of                   
              the University of Pennsylvania for study of transition metal                   
              complexes containing unsaturated silicon ligands.  The research                
              is fundamental in nature, but could have implications for                      
              understanding silane redistribution and dehydrogenative                        
              polymerization and hence for electronic or ceramic materials                   
              development.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Early and late transition metals will be complexed with ligands                
              such as silenes, disilenes, disilabenzenes, disilynes,                         
              silanimines, and silanones.  Reaction mechanisms will be                       
              explored, especially in cases involving Si-Si or M-Si bond                     
              cleavage and silylene extrusion.  In some compounds proposed                   
              for synthesis, observation of migration of a hydride group to a                
              metal may be possible.  Photoelectron spectroscopy and                         
              electrochemical methods will be used to characterize the                       
              electronic structure of new species.
