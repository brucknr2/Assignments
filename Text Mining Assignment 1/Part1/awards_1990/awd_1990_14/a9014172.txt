Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                  
              Training Group in the History, Philosophy and Sociology of Science.            
              The faculty group is a mixture of outstanding junior and senior                
              investigators who come from each of these three areas.  The funds              
              provided by this award will provide stipends for graduate students             
              and postdoctoral fellows, and will defray part of the cost of the              
              trainees' research.  In addition, funds will be used to purchase               
              specialized library resources and research equipment to be used by             
              trainees, and to bring investigators from other research and                   
              academic institutions for short term visits and seminars.  The                 
              areas of research that the training program addresses include the              
              constitution of scientific disciplines, the scientific workplace,              
              authority and credibility in science, naturalistic epistemology,               
              scientific and technological networks, and scientific controversy.             
                                                                                             
              As scientific research and its fruits have come to play an                     
              increasingly important, if not central, role in the everyday life              
              of modern society, interest in understanding the methods and                   
              motivations of scientific researchers has also grown.                          
              Traditionally, such studies of science itself have been done by                
              the scientists themselves; increasingly, the investigators of the              
              phenomenon of science have come from ranks of those with formal                
              backgrounds in history, philosophy or sociology.  Though this has              
              provided for more sophisticated analyses, the lack of individuals              
              trained in more than one of these areas has resulted in an often               
              narrow view of scientific practice and its evolution.  This award              
              will provide funds for the training of a new generation of                     
              investigators of science able to pose questions and investigate                
              phenomena that cross the boundaries and elude the paradigms of                 
              these more traditional approaches to the study of science.
