Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Professor Eric Heller is supported by a grant from the                         
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              research in the area of molecular spectroscopy and dynamics.                   
              This theoretical research will have a major impact on                          
              furthering our fundamental understanding of molecular processes                
              involved in chemical reactions.                                                
                                                                                             
              Several distinct but interrelated lines of research in the                     
              areas of time dependent quantum mechanics, semiclassical                       
              methods, molecular spectrosocpy, and quantum chaology will be                  
              explored.  A new and very fast quantum propagation method will                 
              be developed.  A basis set technique for treating high energy                  
              anharmonic dynamics will be studied.  New methods in theory of                 
              radiationless transitions will be developed which allow                        
              classical trajectories to be used with greater accuracy.  Deep                 
              tunneling matrix elements in intersystem crossing and                          
              nonvertical spectroscopy will be analyzed as potential                         
              semiclassical phase space tools.  The spectra of highly                        
              anharmonic and possibly classically chaotic molecules, for                     
              example the full SEP spectrum of acetylene, will be studied in                 
              light of the time dependent wavepacket picture of electronic                   
              spectroscopy.  The theory of scars in eigenstates will be                      
              extended to include nonlinear dynamics.  The Raman spectra and                 
              dynamics of multi-chromophore molecules will also be studied.
