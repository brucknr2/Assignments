Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-day meeting of leading fluid mechanicists at the                    
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography will discuss promising new                 
              directions in research.  The meeting will honor Professor John                 
              W. Miles on the occasion of his seventieth birthday.  As befits                
              Miles broad interests and range of accomplishments, the                        
              participants will touch upon all aspects of fluid mechanics.                   
              The proceedings of this meeting will be published in a special                 
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography volume, and distributed                    
              widely.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              NSF will help to pay the travel and lodging expenses for                       
              invited speakers who cannot provide their own support.  The                    
              other costs of the meeting will be borne by the University of                  
              California and the Office of Naval Research.
