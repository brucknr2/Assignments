Abstract    :
                   Professor Schoen will work on the relation between Chow                   
              groups and Hodge theory.  He will study the torsion subgroup                   
              as well as the Bloch-Beilinson conjectures.                                    
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                    
              mathematics:  number theory and geometry.  This combination                    
              has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved                   
              problems that withstood generations.  Among its many                           
              consequences are new error correcting codes. Such codes are                    
              essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact                   
              disks.
