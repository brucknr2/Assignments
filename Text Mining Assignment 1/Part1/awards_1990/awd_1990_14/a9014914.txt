Abstract    :
              It is proposed to investigate the unsteady stratified motion                   
              of dense gas-solid suspensions in pipes.  This is an energy                    
              efficient flow regime which occurs at relatively low                           
              velocities,  but larger than the sediment velocity.  A                         
              combination of experimental and theoretical studies will be                    
              undertaken.  Measurements on mean and fluctuating parameters,                  
              including statistical correlations, will be performed in two                   
              test loop systems of 51 mm and 127 mm.  The instrumentation                    
              development includes the corona charger probe for the velocity                 
              measurement.  The basic equations for wave motion in                           
              stratified flow will be formulated.  Finally, an approach to                   
              scale-up results obtained for horizontal conveying of dense                    
              gas-solid suspensions will be proposed.                                        
                                                                                             
              The results may be used for the design and scale up of gas-                    
              solid suspension transportation systems at relatively lower                    
              operation velocities, with positive effects on energy                          
              consumption, particle attrition and erosion of equipment.
