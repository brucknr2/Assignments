Abstract    :
                   Research focuses on probabilistic combinatorial optimization              
              problems and dynamic routing problems with queueing effects.                   
              Included are two areas:  (1) worst-case analysis of heuristics; and            
              (2) multi-server and multi-facility probabilistic combinatorial                
              optimization problems.  It will be shown that the concepts                     
              developed for probabilistic combinatorial optimization problems can            
              be used for optimization of queueing systems and the design of                 
              dynamic routing strategies.                                                    
                   Research should lead to significant progress and expansion of             
              knowledge and have an impact on producing more efficient                       
              distribution and communication systems.
