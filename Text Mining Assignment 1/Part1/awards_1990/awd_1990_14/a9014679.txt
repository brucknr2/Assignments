Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research is proposed on the properties of interfaces.  Studies are             
              to include droplet spreading, pattern formation in chemical                    
              reactions at interfaces, interfacial dynamics, the effect of                   
              wetting on fluid flow in small channels, the coexistence of bulk               
              phases and phases in confined geometries, and elastic relaxation at            
              interaces.  Techniques to be employed include Monte Carlo and                  
              molecular dynamic simulations of both continuum and lattice models,            
              density functionals, mean field theory, and the remonalization                 
              group.
