Abstract    :
              This project relates to the application of                                     
              expert system theory and methodology to                                        
              electric power flow techniques.  One of the                                    
              focus points of the work relates to the                                        
              optimal power flow study problem.  In this                                     
              area, the subjects to be considered are data                                   
              preparation, bad data identification, on-line                                  
              applications, operating constraints,                                           
              contingency constraints, and other issues of                                   
              this large scale optimal dispatch problem.                                     
              The time window to be studied is in the range                                  
              of 15 to 30 minutes for repeated optimal                                       
              dispatch calculations.  Expert system                                          
              methodologies as studied in this work are not                                  
              expected to replace existing software, but to                                  
              be an added tool for operators.
