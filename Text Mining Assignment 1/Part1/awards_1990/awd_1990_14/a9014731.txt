Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  From an operational viewpoint the structure of a complex                  
              system may be defined by its reaction to external probes, not                  
              necessarily weak ones.  This typically requires the introduction               
              of spatial and/or temporal nonuniformity from the outset, at a                 
              level beyond any that the undisturbed system possesses.  The aim               
              of the principal investigator is to construct and solve                        
              carefully models in order to illuminate the local and the global               
              structure of classical lattice gases in thermal equilibrium,                   
              thermalized classical fluids in continuous space, and steady-                  
              state operations of clock-regulated queueing networks.                         
                                                                                             
              The study of natural systems at the microscopic level is a                     
              difficult area of research, given the enormous complexity of                   
              systems that describe everyday phenomena like liquids and gases.               
              The principal investigator will construct and analyze tractable                
              models of various fluids in order to gain insight into their                   
              behavior at the microscopic level.
