Abstract    :
                   This award enables Bucknell University to attach to NSFNET                
              through the Pennsylvania mid-level network PREPnet.  Connection to             
              the Internet will greatly improve access to supercomputers and                 
              other resources needed by the students and faculty.  In particular,            
              reliability and speed of file transfers and electronic mail will be            
              greatly enhanced.                                                              
                   The physical link to PREPnet will be a Proteon IP router                  
              connected between the campus Ethernet backbone and a 56Kbps leased             
              line.  The router, to be provided and maintained by the local                  
              telephone company, is managed by Bell of Pennsylvania.
