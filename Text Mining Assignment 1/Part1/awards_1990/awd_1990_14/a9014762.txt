Abstract    :
              This award supports one conference in a series that has alternated             
              between the east and west coasts for more than a decade.  The                  
              conference is intended to publicize innovative, interdisciplinary              
              research with a strong VLSI component.  This year's focus is on                
              systems integration.  The National Science Foundation support                  
              allows reduced registration rates for students, government and                 
              university employees, and program committee members, and travel and            
              registration expenses for the invited speakers.
