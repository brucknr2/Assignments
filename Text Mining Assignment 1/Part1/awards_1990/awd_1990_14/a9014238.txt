Abstract    :
                   The PIs will test and apply nested photochemical and                      
              meteorological models to ascertain their ability to simulate the               
              production and transport of ozone, nitrogen oxides, and                        
              anthropogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons in the earth's boundary                
              layer.  Specifically, the PIs plan to simulate photochemical                   
              production and transport of tropospheric ozone over a period of                
              one month and an area which encompasses the eastern half of                    
              North America and the western Atlantic Ocean (summer 1988), to                 
              compare simulated and observed rural and urban ozone                           
              concentrations and to identify the causes of discrepancies                     
              between them, to compare simulated concentrations of other                     
              species related to ozone production with observations, to                      
              evaluate the sensitivity of the predicted concentrations to                    
              uncertain model inputs, and investigate sensitivities to                       
              temperature, and to optimize the design of a nested regional-                  
              scale model for selected rural and urban applications.
