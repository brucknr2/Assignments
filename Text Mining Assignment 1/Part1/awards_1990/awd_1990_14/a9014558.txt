Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project provides some support to the National Academy of                  
              Sciences' National Research Council's Board on Chemical                        
              Sciences & Technology (BCST).  The activities of the Board                     
              benefit the chemical sciences where continued health is a                      
              major concern of the NSF Divisions of Chemistry (MPS) and                      
              Chemical and Thermal Systems (Engineering).  The Board, in the                 
                                                                                             
              past, managed the studies on "Separation & Purification" and                   
              "Frontiers in Chemical Engineering" for the CTS Division and,                  
              before that, the "Opportunities in Chemistry" for the                          
              Chemistry Division.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Co-funding of the BCST by NSF helps it continue its tradition                  
              of service to the discipline of chemistry, biochemistry, and                   
              chemical engineering by planning studies on important issues                   
              and by providing the means by which study recommendations can                  
              be disseminated and acted upon.                                                
                                                                                             
              Over the next three years, the Board hopes to formulate a                      
              number of major initiatives, including the following:                          
                                                                                             
                   o    stimulating the development of an improved                           
                   introductory chemistry curriculum;                                        
                   o    improving the management of chemical laboratory                      
                   safety in academic institutions;                                          
                   o    providing guidance on optimal strategies for the                     
                        design, construction, and renovation of chemical                     
                        laboratory facilities;                                               
                   o    continuing coordinated dissemination efforts for the                 
                                                                                             
                        chemistry and chemical engineering survey reports;                   
                   and                                                                       
                   o    initiating a series of short, highly visible                         
                        reports/symposia to highlight especially promising                   
                        chemical research frontiers.  One such report was                    
                        recently started on "Catalyst Science and                            
                   Technology" under the chairmanship of Alexis Bell of the                  
                   University of California-Berkeley, Department of Chemical
