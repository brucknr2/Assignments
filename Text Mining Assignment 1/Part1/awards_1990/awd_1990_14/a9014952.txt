Abstract    :
                   A program of analysis of Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME)                  
              global radiance data sets will be used to investigate the El                   
              Chichon stratospheric aerosol cloud.  Global observations at                   
              wavelengths of .44, 1.27, 1.87, 6.8, and 9.6 microns were                      
              returned by SME limb sounding experiments over the 1982-1986                   
              period, providing complete temporal coverage of the El Chichon                 
              event.  The extensive latitudinal (global) and vertical (18-50                 
              km) breadth of the SME observations leads to a comprehensive data              
              set for definition of the evolution of the El Chichon aerosols.                
              The project will analyze the multi-wavelength SME observations to              
              constrain the aerosol mass and particle size distribution                      
              throughout the growth, maturity, and decay stages of the El                    
              Chichon aerosol cloud.  Aerosol mass can be determined directly                
              from the thermal-IR radiances (6.8 and 9.6 microns).  Strong                   
              aerosol scattering signatures in the visible and near-IR data                  
              sets will provide the particle size distributions as a function                
              of time.  Available ground-based, aircraft, and balloon                        
              observations of El Chichon aerosols will be incorporated into the              
              analysis for the purposes of validation.  A key aspect of the                  
              proposed investigation is the involvement of a graduate student,               
              towards the completion of a PH.D. thesis.
