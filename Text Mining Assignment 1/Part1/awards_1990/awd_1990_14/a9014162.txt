Abstract    :
              The goal of the second edition of the AMAST conference is to                   
              consolidate the trend created by the international dialogue during the         
              first edition of the AMAST making a new step toward transforming               
              algebraic methodology into software technology.  The plan is to                
              provide a forum for algebraists, computer scientists, and software             
              developers who are capable of tracing the lines of further development         
              in computer technology based on algebraic methodology and of                   
              demonstrating the power of the algebraic methodology by their software         
              products.
