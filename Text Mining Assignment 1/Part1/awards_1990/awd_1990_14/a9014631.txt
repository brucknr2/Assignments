Abstract    :
              This SMALL GRANT FOR EXPLORATORY RESEARCH is made to study residual            
              stresses in ceramic matrix composites. The main point to be                    
              investigated is how these residual stresses change during                      
              processing.  Novel photoelastic techniques will be used.
