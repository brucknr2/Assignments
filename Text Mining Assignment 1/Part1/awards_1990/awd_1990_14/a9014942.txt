                   This action will provide SRS with the technical assistance

              provided in the following areas:  statistical (sample design,                  
              weighting, and item imputation), development of quality profiles,              
              instrument design (including input from users on the content of                
              the surveys, as well as assistance with the technical design of                
              the instruments), and data dissemination.
