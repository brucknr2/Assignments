Abstract    :
                   The objective of this industry internship is to establish                 
              faculty-student-industry partnership teams to address specific                 
              industry problems.  Projects will be carried out in collaboration              
              with Dana Corporation in Fort Wayne, Indiana and General Mills in              
              Toledo, Ohio.  The project at Dana consists of a competitive cost              
              analysis of current manufacturing operations.  The project at                  
              General Mills will utilize statistical process control techniques              
              to analyze quality management practices.  Both projects involve                
              extensive student interaction consistent with the guidelines of the            
              internship initiative.
