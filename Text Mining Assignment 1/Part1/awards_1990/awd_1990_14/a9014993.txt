Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research described in this proposal will examine the spatial               
              and temporal structure of ensemble encoded information within                  
              the hippocampus of the rat.  Data from these experiments will                  
              provide information essential to hypotheses concerning the nature              
              of associative processing within this region.  To evaluate these               
              hypotheses, a computational model of the CA3-CA1 network will be               
              developed to explain observed experimental results.  Modeling and              
              data analysis work will be done on high performance RISC                       
              workstations utilizing supercomputer resources if necessary.                   
              Overall, this work represents an attempt to integrate systems                  
              level neurophysiological data with predictions made by                         
              computational theories of learning and memory through the use of               
              computer modeling.
