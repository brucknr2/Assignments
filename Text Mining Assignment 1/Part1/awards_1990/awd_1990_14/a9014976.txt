Abstract    :
              To assist young U.S. physicists to attend the Nineteenth                       
              International Conference on Low Temperature Physics which will be              
              held in Great Britain during August, 1990.  The grant would be                 
              administered by the Low Temperature Support Group which is an                  
              advisory committee recently formed by balloting more than 200                  
              members of the United States' low temperature community.  The                  
              bookkeeping and administration of this proposal will be handled                
              through IBM at the T.J. Watson Research Labs under the                         
              supervision of the Support Group and Dr. Richard Webb.  IBM will               
              charge no overhead for providing this service.
