Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                     
              Allan Lichtenberg of the University of California at Berkeley                  
              and Dr. R.W. Boswell at the Australian National University.                    
              The primary objective is to integrate U.S.analytic models                      
              with Australian  numerical simulations to advance under-                       
              standing of the stochastic heating processes in oscillating                    
              sheaths (electronic beams) and the resulting energy and                        
              particle balance. The approach will interpret Australian                       
              numerical results in light of U.S. analytic results, will                      
              propose new numerical experiments to test analytic predictions,                
              and will build,in general, better analytic models of plasmas                   
              and dynamic magnetic fields.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The project represents excellent collaboration between the                     
              Australian group and its expertise in numerical simulations                    
              and the Lichtenberg work in analytic models. This is important                 
              fundamental work on plasma dynamics, as well as having                         
              potential for application to improved materials etching                        
              devices.
