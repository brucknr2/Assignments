Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this proposal, our purpose is to ascertain the                              
              determinants of job satisfaction and happiness with family                     
              life from among twenty-six variables that are believed to                      
              have an influence upon both.  In order to determine the                        
              relative importance of the variables in accounting for the                     
              variations in both job satisfaction and happiness in                           
              family life, a block-recursive model depicting the                             
              bariable relationships has been developed and is to be                         
              subjected to empirical testing on a sample of 13,926 black                     
              and white female respondents.  The theoretical model will                      
              allow us to determine which factors are the most                               
              important in determining job satisfaction and happiness                        
              with life.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              In addition, it is perceived that the use of a block-                          
              recursive model will clarify some of the confusion                             
              existing in the current body of literature regarding the                       
              determinants of job and family satisfaction, while, at the                     
              same time, enable us to suggest a more parsimonious theory                     
              regarding the interrelationship of the variables.                              
                                                                                             
              The assessment of the relationships of the variables will                      
              be simplified through the use of multiple regression                           
              techniques with a multiple-partial correlational                               
              analysis.  This technique provides useful statistical data                     
              and tests of statistical significance regarding the                            
              interpretation of the data, and generalization of the                          
              findings to the general population of English speaking,                        
              female residents of the United states who are 18, and who                      
              do not reside in an institutional environment.
