Abstract    :
                   Direct numerical solutions of the time dependent Hartree                  
              Fock equations for ions colliding with atoms and solids will be                
              carried out.  Large scale computer codes using B-spline and                    
              split operator methods have been developed to improve the                      
              numerics.  The techniques will be used to examine the non                      
              linear response  of metal foil conduction band electrons to the                
              passage of larger particles, to ion-atom collisions, muon                      
              capture and to the ionization of atoms by strong laser pulses.
