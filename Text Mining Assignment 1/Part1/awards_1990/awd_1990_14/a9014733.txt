Abstract    :
                   This grant will fund a three day conference on the topic of               
              Approximation Theory to be held at Memphis State University on                 
              March 21-23, 1991.  There will be nine invited speakers from the               
              U.S. and abroad, including D. Burkholder, R. DeVore, K. De'Boor,               
              E. Cheney, P. Nevai and E. Saff.  In addition, there will be                   
              opportunity for other researchers to present papers, and for the               
              speakers, participants and graduate students to discuss new ideas              
              and new methods for doing research.  The proceedings of the                    
              conference will be published.
