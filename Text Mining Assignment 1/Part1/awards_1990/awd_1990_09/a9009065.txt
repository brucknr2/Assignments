Abstract    :
                   This is a research planning grant for the purpose of                      
              supporting Professor Parker's activities in a preliminary study                
              of her proposed research project.  The grant will provide funds                
              for her to visit established research centers and consult with                 
              experts in the field.  In addition she will attend several                     
              conferences and participate in research seminars.                              
                   The project itself deals with C* algebras.  The notion of a               
              C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of a family of linear                 
              transformations on a space.  These transformations can also be                 
              thought of as having values in the states of the space, and the                
              property of this family which is responsible for the symbol * is               
              that the algebra is generated by transformations whose values in               
              these states are real numbers.  The fact that these objects                    
              appear naturally in many branches of mathematics and physics make              
              them important to study.
