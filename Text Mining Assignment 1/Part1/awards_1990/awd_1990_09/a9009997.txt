Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to establish the basic                        
              engineering relationships required for the minimization of                     
              undesirable convective heat transfer in combustion systems                     
              through the application of electric fields.  The program will                  
              provide verification of the feasibility of applying these                      
              relationships to practical devices, through an experimental                    
              program testing this concept over a variety of conditions.                     
                                                                                             
              A range of combustion and electrical conditions will be                        
              evaluated in a step combustor, a basic research tool embodying                 
              physical features relevant to practical devices.  Primary                      
              instrumentation will be an optical thermal imaging system and                  
              schlieren visualization system; experimental results will                      
              include flowfield visualization, thermal contour maps of the                   
              combustor wall, analyses of the local internal heat transfer                   
              coefficient under the range of flow conditions tested, and                     
              dependence of these parameters on applied electric field                       
              strength and electrode configuration.                                          
              Application of the results of this program will provide                        
              reductions in undesired convective heat transfer coefficients                  
              to surfaces near combustion processes.  This will allow higher                 
              operating temperatures and decrease wall cooling requirements,                 
              leading to associated higher efficiencies in combustion                        
              engines.
