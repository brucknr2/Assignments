Abstract    :
              This research project will study the dynamic response and shear                
              wave velocities of silt under dynamic loadings using the spectral              
              analysis of surface waves method. The results could be of value in             
              geotechnical engineering practice, for example the stability of                
              waterfront and offshore structures built on silty deposits.
