Abstract    :
              Inheritance networks are structures employed to represent common-              
              sence knowledge.  Previous work has developed framework for                    
              specifying declarative semantics of inheritance networks.  This                
              enables us to provide a model-theoretic specification of the                   
              meaning that is conceptually simple and computationally                        
              tractable.  The current reasearch goal is to investigate                       
              implementation issues concerning our inheritance theories and                  
              their extensions. This work will include the design of efficient               
              inheritance algorithms and analyses of their computational                     
              complexity.  The issue of interfacing inheritance networks with                
              an Expert System will also be considered.  In particualr, this                 
              reserch will address the question of the kinds of queries that                 
              are posed to a network, and will try to develop special purpose                
              algorithms for implementing them.  Furthermore, there seem to be               
              equally well-motivated, yet significantly different                            
              interpretations of certain network topologies.  This is, in part,              
              due to the fact that inheritance networks are not sufficiently                 
              expressive.  We will study this aspect systematically, using the               
              analysis to design a more expressive language that will make                   
              explicit the available choices.  A good understanding inheritance              
              reasoning will provide valuable insights to tackle challenging                 
              problems in the reals of nonmonotonic reasoning.
