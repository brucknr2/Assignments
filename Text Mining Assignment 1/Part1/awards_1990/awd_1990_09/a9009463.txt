Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will analyze previously collected data from SOFAR                 
              floats and current meters located in the eastern subtropical                   
              Atlantic Ocean.  The advection and diffusion of the subsurface                 
              tongue formed by Mediterranean Water will be emphasized.  Also                 
              simulation of float tracks will be calculated using results of                 
              the Community Modeling Effort solution for the same region.
