Abstract    :
              Admicellar catalysis, a novel technique to enhance reaction                    
              rates and selectivities. will be investigated.  The hydrolysis                 
              of ethyl benzoate has been selected as a model reaction.  The                  
              catalysis by a cationic surfactant adsorbed on porous silica                   
              will be studied over a range of surface coverages, support                     
              surface areas, and porosities, and solution pH and reactant                    
              concentrations.  The objectives are (1) the quantitative                       
              evaluation of admicellar catalysis, and (2) the clarification                  
              of the morphology of the adsorbed surfactant aggregates.                       
                                                                                             
              Admicellar catalysis is similar in many ways to micellar                       
              catalysis.  Exploitation of micellar catalysis is discourage                   
              by the difficulty of product separation from the catalyst.                     
              The significant advantages of admicellar catalysis are                         
              expected to include (1) easy separation of the catalyst from                   
              the product, and (2) enhanced reaction rates and selectivities                 
              due to the particular characteristics of adsorbed surfactant                   
              aggregates.  the results of this study may lead to new,                        
              efficient catalytic processes for production of pesticides,                    
              pharmaceuticals, and other highly specific reaction products,                  
              and to new processes for hazardous chemical detoxification.                    
              In addition, this study should provide new knowledge on                        
              absorbed surfactant aggregate structures.  This information is                 
              of great practical importance to the fields of detergency,                     
              enhanced oil recovery, and numerous other areas.
