Abstract    :
              This is the 6th Bridge Workshop to be conducted under the auspices             
              of the UJNR Panel on Wind and Seismic effects.  This meeting will              
              take place in May 1990 in California and Nevada.   Papers will be              
              presented and site visits made to bridge structures to observe new             
              concepts and construction details.  Proceedings will be published              
              and distributed.
