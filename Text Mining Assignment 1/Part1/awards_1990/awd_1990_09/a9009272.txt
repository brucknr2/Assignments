Abstract    :
              Geometric algorithms, when implemented using rounded arithmetic, are           
              generally unreliable.  Unfortunately, exact arithmetic is impractical,         
              and much development time is spent modifying geometric programs to             
              deal with round-off error, never reaching absolute reliability.                
              Investigation will be carried out in the area of robust geometry: the          
              specification and creation of geometric algorithms with provably               
              correct rounded arithmetic implementations.  Under the strict                  
              robustness approach followed in this project, algorithms are also              
              feasible and accurate, meaning that they generate valid geometric              
              objects close to the exact answer.  Employing techniques called xy-            
              monotonic reasoning and high level rounding, the investigator has              
              recently presented algorithms for accurately and efficiently                   
              performing any combination of set operations and Euclidean                     
              transformations on polygonal regions in the plane.  Strictly robust            
              algorithms will now be developed for constructing the following                
              objects: convex hulls and Voronoi diagrams of points in multiple               
              dimensions, Voronoi diagrams of polyhedra, and intersections of                
              polyhedral regions.  These objects have important applications, among          
              them the modeling of solids and the automatic generation of meshes for         
              finite element analysis.  In addition, the experience gained from the          
              creation of these algorithms is expected to provide a basis for the            
              creation of other robust algorithms.
