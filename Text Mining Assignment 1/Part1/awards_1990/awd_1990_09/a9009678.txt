Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              This project concerns the development of the theory of harmonic                
              phonology, and proposes a mathematical implementation based                    
              loosely on connectionist principles for the implementation of                  
              certain rules in the system.  The goal of harmonic phonology is                
              to elaborate an account of phonological systems in which a                     
              central role is given to the generalization that phonological                  
              rules consistently serve to increase the conformity of                         
              phonological representations to general well-formedness                        
              conditions, or phonotactics.  The investigator will study a range              
              of languages throughout the world, and show that their                         
              phonological processes consistently serve to increase the                      
              well-formedness of their representations on one of three distinct              
              phonological levels.  Such a view is compatible with a view of                 
              phonology as a system seeking maximal constraint-satisfaction, a               
              view that allows for computational implementation in ways that                 
              have not been attempted before.
