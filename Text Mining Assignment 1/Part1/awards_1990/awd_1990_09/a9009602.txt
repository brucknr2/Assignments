Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is to perform research on the design of management                
              accounting information systems.  Accounting information is used by             
              large firms to support budgeting, decision-making, and performance             
              evaluation.  The research concerns the design of integrated systems            
              in which managers participate in the budgeting and decision process            
              with the objective of maximizing their performance measures.  This             
              project also includes research on models of decentralized decision-            
              making in which individuals attempt to learn their optimal decisions           
              from data generated by past decisions.  Simple individualistic                 
              learning mechanisms sometimes give rise to unstable interactions               
              among the learning adjustments of different individuals.  This                 
              research concerns the apparent trade-off between the simplicity of             
              learning mechanisms and the range of environments for which the                
              learning mechanisms coverage to optimality.
