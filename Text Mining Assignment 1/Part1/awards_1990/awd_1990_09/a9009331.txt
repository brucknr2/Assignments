Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop techniques for the                      
              noninvasive description of the mechanics of the right                          
              ventricular free wall of the heart.  First, an image of                        
              the free wall is reconstructed from magnetic resonance                         
              images, then the tension in the wall is determined based                       
              on the right ventricular pressure and the MRI-derived                          
              cardiac geometry.  Through the sophisticated use of                            
              engineering mechanics the project is to result in                              
              enhanced understanding of cardiac physiology; it may also                      
              lead to a new noninvasive method to characterize right                         
              ventricular function.
