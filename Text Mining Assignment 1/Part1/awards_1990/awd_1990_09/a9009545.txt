Abstract    :
                   An important failure mechanism for ductile metals is the                  
              growth and coalescence of microscopic voids.                                   
                   In this work an explicit Eulerian code will be developed to               
              study at the micromechanical level the dynamic failure of solids               
              by void growth and coalescence.  The highly sophisticated and                  
              accurate interface tracking methods developed for hypervelocity                
              impact and penetration calculations will be adopted for evolving               
              new surfaces.  The accuracy of the Eulerian calculations will                  
              result in greater insight into this important failure mechanism.
