Abstract    :
              The mantissae of floating-point numbers are often assumed to be                
              logarithmically distributed; that is they are assumed to have a                
              reciprocal probability density function.  Mantissae of products of             
              floating-point numbers are logarithmically distributed when at least           
              one of the factors has a mantissa that is so distributed.  However,            
              the logarithmic distribution of mantissae is not preserved under               
              floating-point addition.  The aim of this project is to derive a               
              density function for the sum of two or more floating-point numbers             
              that have logarithmically distributed mantissae and exponents that are         
              not uniformly distributed.  The deviation between the density function         
              for this sum and the reciprocal density will be measured using a               
              relative supremum norm.  Error bounds will be derived for this                 
              deviation.  The resulting density functions can then be used to                
              compute probabilistic error bounds for floating-point sums.
