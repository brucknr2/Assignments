Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The problem of large scale post-earthquake                                     
              urban search and rescue has been recognized in                                 
              recent foreign earthquakes (Mexico City 1985,                                  
              Armenia 1988).  Initial actions have been                                      
              taken to develop an urban search and rescue                                    
              response capability in the United States.                                      
              This effort has been based on fragmentary                                      
              experience.  The planning assumptions of                                       
              local, state and Federal response plans have                                   
              been of a hypothetical nature.  The Loma                                       
              Prieta earthquake, while not a major event in                                  
              terms of building collapse, does provide a                                     
              very useful occasion for the testing of urban                                  
              search and rescue (USAR) response planning                                     
              assumptions.  It also provides the opportunity                                 
              to assess the relevance of USAR training                                       
              programs which have been developed to date.                                    
              This work along with other research under way                                  
              on emergent group formation and rescue                                         
              equipment performance should provide timely                                    
              guidance for major investment in the USAR                                      
              response system which is now being                                             
              contemplated by local, state and Federal                                       
              agencies.
