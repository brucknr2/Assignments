Abstract    :
                 This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Budriene to                 
              initiate independent studies in the area of bacterial colonial                 
              organization.  These studies will be based on some novel and                   
              intriguing observations she has made regarding pattern formation               
              in colonies of motile bacteria which are mutant in their ability               
              to respond chemotactically to certain nutrients.                               
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that this award will help Dr. Budriene obtain                
              the preliminary results necessary to launch an independent                     
              research career.
