Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr.                    
              Maurice LeBrun of the University of Texas to conduct collaborative             
              research for six months with Dr. Tatsuoki Takeda of the Naka                   
              Fusion Research Establishment, Japan Atomic Energy Research                    
              Institute, in Naka-machi, Ibaraki-ken, Japan.  They will apply                 
              large scale numerical simulation methods to the study of plasma                
              transport processes in toroidal magnetic confinement devices, with             
              a goal of increased understanding and predictive capability.                   
                                                                                             
              Dr. LeBrun has been involved in the development of a particle                  
              simulation model and code for studying confined plasmas in                     
              realistic geometries.  The Naka Fusion Research Establishment has              
              a strong theoretical and experimental program centered around the              
              JT-60 tokamak, one of the three largest plasma fusion experiments              
              in the world.  This collaboration will enable the P.I. to interface            
              with scientists studying the physics of large plasma confinement               
              devices, and thus apply model to physically relevant studies.
