Abstract    :
              The main body of control literature has dealt with the                         
              development of controller design techniques for linear time-                   
              invariant systems.  Nonlinearities encountered in a process                    
              model have usually been treated as uncertainties resulting                     
              from the linearization of that model around a steady state.                    
              Most of the real processes in chemicals manufacturing are                      
              inherently nonlinear due to, for example, the exponential form                 
              of the rate equations' dependance on temperature, hold-up on                   
              trays in distillation columns, etc.                                            
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to develop controller design                  
              methodologies for continuous-time nonlinear processes.                         
              Process modelling uncertainty, disturbance uncertainty, and                    
              hard constraints on process inputs and outputs will be                         
              explicitly considered.  The overall controller design problem                  
              will be formulated as a weighted minmax problem, whose                         
              solution will not be interpreted as "worst-case" design, but                   
              will be shown to generate one of the noninferior solutions to                  
              a naturally occurring multi-objective optimization problem.                    
              Investigation of the solvability and of theoretical properties                 
              of the minmax problem will be undertaken through a number of                   
              case studies on chemical and biochemical reactors and                          
              distillation columns, all of which are known to present                        
              nonlinearities.  Nonsmooth calculus of variations will be used                 
              to perform the maximization of the objective function with                     
              respect to closed loop input signals, while nonlinear                          
              programming will be employed to carry out the minimization                     
              with respect to the controller, the latter modelled through                    
              finite Volterra series.
