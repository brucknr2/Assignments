Abstract    :
                This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Newport to                   
              initiate independent studies of the expression of Drosophila                   
              neurogenesis genes in the neural crest of the chick embryo.                    
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that this award will help Dr. Newport obtain                 
              the preliminary results necessary to launch an independent                     
              research career.
