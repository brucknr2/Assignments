Abstract    :
              An experimental study to investigate the interaction between                   
              droplets and comparable sized turbulent gas vortices is                        
              proposed.  Measurements of droplet diameters, velocities, and                  
              accelerations in a turbulent air stream will be made using                     
              strobed shadow photography.  The turbulent air flow will be                    
              generated in a wind tunnel with turbulence generating grids.                   
              Laser Doppler velocimetry will be used to characterize the gas                 
              turbulence.  Data on the mass and momentum transfer, drop drag                 
              coefficients and evaporation rates will be obtained in the                     
              range of droplet Reynolds numbers (1 to 500) seen in real                      
              sprays.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The results will be useful for better understanding droplet                    
              transport processes, with application to modeling sprays in                    
              combustion chambers.
