Abstract    :
                   In this Research Opportunities for Women/ Research Planning               
              Grant, Dr. Priscilla Tucker, at the University of Michigan,                    
              proposes a preliminary evaluation of DNA sequence data from the                
              mammalian Y-chromosome for its use in systematic studies. Y-                   
              chromosome genes are of interest because they are inherited only               
              through male lineages and, thus, will provide a useful contrast                
              to mitochondrial genes which are inherited strictly through                    
              female lineages. Specifically, Dr. Tucker will use DNA probes for              
              a sequence called pY8/B to survey species in the rodent tribe                  
              Peromyscini. The distribution of the pY8/b region will be                      
              studied in context of the evolutionary history of the group. The               
              exact nucleotide sequences for the pY8/B sequence will also be                 
              determined for several species, and the value of the sequence                  
              data for inferring the evolutionary history of the group                       
              determined. The research will make an important contribution to                
              understanding the origin of biodiversity in mammalian species.
