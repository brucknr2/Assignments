Abstract    :
              Plants are used as the source of many useful compounds                         
              and mixtures including pharmaceuticals, flavors and                            
              fragrances, essential oils, enzymes, and pigments.  Large                      
              markets exist for these secondary plant metabolites which                      
              are normally obtained by extraction from intact plants.                        
              Plant tissue culture (PTC) may provide an alternative to                       
              whole plants as biological sources of these useful                             
              compounds.  PTC is a technique which allows plant cells                        
              to be grown in solid or liquid medium in the laboratory                        
              under carefully controlled environmental conditions.  The                      
              purpose of this study is to develop a model system for                         
              studying the potential of strawberry cells grown in                            
              culture to produce flavors and pigments of interest to                         
              the food processing industry as natural food ingredients.                      
              The investigations will include the production of the                          
              anticarcinogenic compound, ellagic acid, by strawberry                         
              cell suspension cultures.  Factors that influence the                          
              kinetics of growth and secondary metabolite production of                      
              strawberry cells will be systematically studied using                          
              suspension cultures propagated in roller bottle and low-                       
              shear cell culture bioreactors.  Information obtained in                       
              this study will be applicable to other plant cell culture                      
              systems.
