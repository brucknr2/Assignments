Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will extend a model-                 
              based reasoning approach (Functional Reasoning) to large-scale                 
              biogeochemical modeling.  Functional Reasoning is a methodology                
              for device knowledge capture.  Because it has the potential for                
              allowing complex systems to be modeled from a quantitative,                    
              top-down perspective, it is ideally suited for addressing                      
              recalcitrant problems in biology in which more is known about the              
              end result (e.g. atmospheric concentrations of biogenic trace                  
              gases) than is known about the biological interactions giving                  
              rise to the end result.  Before Functional Reasoning can be used               
              in real world settings, a method to allow simulation of highly                 
              interactive sub-systems of devices must be developed.  This is                 
              the objective of the work.  This research is interdisciplinary                 
              (between Computer Science and Ecological Modeling).  It will                   
              provide a theoretical approach for attacking very pressing                     
              problems such as issues of global change.
