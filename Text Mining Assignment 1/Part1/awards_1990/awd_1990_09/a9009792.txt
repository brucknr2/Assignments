Abstract    :
              This proposal for a Research Planning Grant expands previous                   
              research on safety-monitoring systems in the air traffic sector to             
              other sectors.  The main purpose of the planning grant is to                   
              conduct preliminary research to determine which monitoring systems             
              will be studied in depth as part of the planned research project.              
              The research will examine the ways organizations collect                       
              information about and learn from near accidents.                               
                                                                                             
              During the planning period, the principal investigator will examine            
              archival data and conduct interviews.  Research sites include                  
              systems for monitoring medical instruments, the production of                  
              nuclear energy, and the coordination of telephone operations.  The             
              proposed research will contribute to the study of information                  
              acquisition and processing in organizations, as well as to analysis            
              of organizational learning.
