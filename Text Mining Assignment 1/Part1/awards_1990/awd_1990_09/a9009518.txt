Abstract    :
              This project aims to obtain the flame thickness response to                    
              stretch, preferential diffusion, and turbulence.  It proposes                  
              three specific objectives:  (i) develop an innovative concept                  
              of using velocity profiles to define and quantify flame                        
              thicknesses such that they can be meaningfully evaluated with                  
              ease and accuracy;  (ii) obtain one-dimensional, adiabatic,                    
              premixed flame thicknesses;  (iii) obtain flame thickness                      
              response to physico-chemical parameters for comparison with                    
              theoretical predictions.  Furthermore, the results from this                   
              proposed program may provide a basis for extending the concept                 
              to nonpremixed flames.  The velocity profiles and conditional                  
              velocity statistics will be obtained by using laser doppler                    
              velocimetry.  A counterflow nozzle configuration will be used                  
              to stabilize planar, adiabatic flames.                                         
                                                                                             
              The results obtained from this proposed experimental study                     
              will be valuable because (i) they will validate a simple                       
              method of evaluating the flame thickness which is an intrinsic                 
              property of flames;  (ii) they will consolidate numerous                       
              definitions in use presently, thereby promoting unity in its                   
              description and usage;  and (iii) they will complement and                     
              test theoretical studies on flame thickness.  Because flame                    
              thickness has been extensively used in describing behavior of                  
              flames important in flame stabilization and for interpreting                   
              turbulent combustion, the proposed study is of fundamental and                 
              practical importance to combustion science and technology.
