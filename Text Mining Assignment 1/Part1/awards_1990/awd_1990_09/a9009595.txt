Abstract    :
                   This award extends for one year the American Statistical                  
              Association project entitled "On-Site Research to Improve the Quality          
              of Education Statistics".  The plan for subsequent years is to effect a        
              merger with similar on-site research programs conducted at the Bureau          
              of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.                              
                                                                                             
              The program,  which was initiated at the National Center of Education          
              Statistics in 1986,  brings senior research fellows and associates to          
              the Center for periods of up to one year.  Its broadbased goal is to           
              help bridge the gap between academic scholars and governmental                 
              scientists by exposing the fellows and associates to methodological            
              problems and policy issues likely to be encountered only in a large            
              scale Federal statistical agency and by exposing government social             
              scientists to new theoretical developments which might have application        
              to their work.  Residence at the Center allows fellows and associates          
              to carry out research that would be difficult if not impossible to do          
              without ready access to its data resources which the program provides.
