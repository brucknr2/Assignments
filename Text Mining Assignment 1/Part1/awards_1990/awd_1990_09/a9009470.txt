Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Thierry-                  
              Palmer's sabbatical visit to Dr. John Suttie's laboratory at the               
              University of Wisconsin.  The goal of the project is to identify               
              vitamin K-dependent proteins and determine their function, with                
              special attention to their possible role in calcium ion                        
              concentration homeostasis in mitochondria.                                     
                                                                                             
              Dr. Thierry-Palmer has an established record of productivity in                
              the area of vitamin D metabolism.  This sabbatical visit will                  
              permit her to return to her earlier interest in vitamin K, and                 
              develop a new line of research which is anticipated to                         
              significantly enhance her career.
