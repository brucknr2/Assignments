Abstract    :
              The general question addressed by this project is: Which performance           
              increases are achievable in practice from parallelizing an existing            
              large Computer Algebra application when using "threads" (lightweight           
              processes) on a shared memory machine?  In particular, what is the             
              lowest level of algebraic computation at which significant speed-ups           
              can be obtained by exploiting the medium-grained parallelism provided          
              by threads?                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The concrete research objective is to develop a framework for parallel         
              programming in the ALDES/SAC-2 Computer Algebra System, and to                 
              effectively parallelize a significant part of the existing system.             
              The environment for parallelization will be C-threads on an Encore             
              Multimax.  System oriented work will modify SAC-2 to allow large scale         
              development of a parallelized system, including running existing code          
              in parallel.  In algorithms oriented work, targets for parallelization         
              include the existing algorithms for the computation of Cylindrical             
              Algebraic Decomposition, polynomial resultants, polynomial GCD's,              
              polynomial real-root isolation, and arithmetic in basic algebraic              
              domains.  The complete system will then provide empirical data which           
              will help estimate the practical potential of new parallel algorithms          
              proposed in the literature.
