Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research addresses the topic of robot path planning.                      
              In this project, direct methods for planning high speed                        
              motions of realistic industrial robots are developed.  A                       
              recently developed geometric approach to the dynamic                           
              performance of multi-body systems is used.  It transforms                      
              the complex motion planning problem into a simple geometric                    
              task while taking into consideration robot dynamics,                           
              actuator constraints, and obstacles in an efficient manner.                    
              The method's implied computational efficiency makes  on-                       
              line computation of close to optimal motions possible.  If                     
              successful, this research will be a step in improving the                      
              productivity and utility of robotic systems.  It may allow                     
              optimizing automated assembly processes and the operation                      
              of flexible automated cells.
