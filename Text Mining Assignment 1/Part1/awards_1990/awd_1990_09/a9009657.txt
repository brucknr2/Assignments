Abstract    :
              The research is to focus on various classical questions in complexity          
              theory, as they are posed anew in various settings of two-person               
              probabilistic games, specifically interactive and zero knowledge               
              interactive proofs, and games against nature.  The kinds of questions          
              considered include (a) comparing the strengths of different models of          
              probabilism, e.g. one-sided error, two-sided error, unbounded error;           
              (b) limiting the number of random bits used, or questions analogous to         
              more classical questions involving pseudorandom number generation;             
              (c) understanding the power of alternation or interaction; and,                
              finally, (d) restricting the flow of information.
