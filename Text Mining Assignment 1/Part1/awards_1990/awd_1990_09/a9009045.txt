Abstract    :
              The friction and vibration and their interaction in slider-                    
              crank mechanisms will be studied.  Experimental results will                   
              be supported by analytical models based on EHD lubrication for                 
              the slider and mixed lubrication for the rings.  The                           
              possibility of affecting and controlling friction by imposing                  
              vibrations on the system will be evaluated.
