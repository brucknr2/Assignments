Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The proposed research will examine synaptic connections in                
              the cortex and hippocampus of rats.  This work will lay the                    
              groundwork for future investigations of experimentally activated               
              pathways in the brain.  The discovery of a generalized marker for              
              recent neural activity will be of great value in studies of brain              
              dysfunctions in which learning is impaired.
