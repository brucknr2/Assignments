Abstract    :
              Datalog, also known as database logic, is one of the simplest                  
              formalisms that can be used to write rule-based programs;                      
              intuitively, Datalog is Prolog without function symbols.                       
              Datalog is the language of choice to write knowledge-based                     
              applications, by adding rules to a relational database system.                 
              However, to be able to use this formalism efficiently, the                     
              optimization problem of Datalog programs must be solved.                       
              To solve this problem it is desirable to be able to detect when a              
              recursive database logic program is bounded, that is, whether the              
              program is equivalent to a nonrecursive one. This is a central                 
              issue in the optimization of Datalog programs. This research                   
              project is concerned with the characterization of some classes of              
              bounded Datalog programs when the relational database is                       
              consistent with respect to some constraints. The constraints                   
              considered in this research are functional dependencies.                       
              This research project provides a methodology for more efficient                
              query processing in knowledge-base systems that are being built                
              as extensions of relational database systems. This in turn makes               
              such knowledge-base systems more feasible for use in practice.
