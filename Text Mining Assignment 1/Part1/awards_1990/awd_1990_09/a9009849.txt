Abstract    :
                   Research planning will be carried out for needed                          
              measurements of excitation functions of stable and long lived-                 
              isotopes at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory.  The emphasis                    
              will be on isotopes of interest in astrophysical research.                     
              Coupled with accelerator mass spectroscopy techniques,                         
              understanding of the excitation (or production) mechanisms can                 
              be used in tracking (or dating) processes such as the constancy                
              of the solar cosmic ray flux over geologic time periods.
