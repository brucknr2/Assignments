Abstract    :
              Dutt         This research is on a framework for IC circuit and system  design,
              which uses a mixed media approach to aid engineers in  modeling designs for
              high level synthesis.  Design tools are  being built on top of a graphical
              input language and a tabular  intermediate representation.  The representation
              uses a general  design model that includes synchronous and asynchronous
              behavior,  timing constraints and protocols between communicating designs.  
              Specific research tasks are:  1.     An environment for high level synthesis
              which provides  multiple input media for design conceptualization and capture; 
              2.     Inclusion of partially designed structures and user bindings  into the
              environment;  3.     Modeling guidelines for design description in VHDL which 
              support high level synthesis and simulation.         This supplement provides
              support for a minority graduate  student.
