Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  This project continues research begun under NSF grant BNS                 
              88-12552 from September 1988 through August 1990.  Both the                    
              earlier research and the present project explore the role of                   
              urbanization in language change.  During the new funding period,               
              the investigation will focus on how changes diffuse and how                    
              vernaculars evolve.  Of special interest will be changes that                  
              reflect internal developments rather than external influence.                  
                                                                                             
                   For the ensuing funding period, new data collection will be               
              minimal, consisting primarily of one additional telephone poll.                
              Primary efforts will be devoted to analyzing data already                      
              collected, in examination of the major research questions of                   
              interest.
