Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research is to understand the influence of               
              particle size distribution in powdered materials on subsequent                 
              coarsening, densification and grain growth during solid-state                  
              sintering.  The program involves experimental testing, modeling                
              and computer simulation of the sintering process.  Stereological               
              analyses of the microstructures resulting from the various                     
              processing steps reveal effects of particle size distribution and              
              controlled additions of impurities.  The emphasis is along two                 
              related paths, the effects of particle size distribution on                    
              coarsening and the mechanisms of grain growth inhibition as                    
              influenced by dopant concentration and type.  Material systems                 
              under study include tungsten-nickel-iron, zinc oxide-barium                    
              oxide, and aluminum oxide doped with magnesium oxide.
