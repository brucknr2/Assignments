Abstract    :
                   This award, a Research Planning Grant, supports the work in               
              graph theory of Professor Brigitte Servatius of the Worcester                  
              Polytechnic Institute. Dr. Servatius will make use of this award               
              to become more broadly informed in the theory of graphs and the                
              rigidity of graphs.                                                            
                   This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,               
              which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                 
              Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the               
              very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                    
              modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                
              counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                
              techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the              
              field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                 
              because of its importance in communications and information                    
              technology. Dr. Servatius's project is especially interdisci-                  
              plinary in that it has interactions with both robotics and                     
              algebraic geometry.
