Abstract    :
              Redundance control is always considered as one of the most challenging         
              problems to the automation of reasoning, because of combinatorial              
              explosion in inferences generated during the search of solutions (of           
              any non-trivial problems).  This project will investigate a powerful           
              inference rule called clausal superposition, which combines resolution         
              and paramodulation together, but generates much less inferences.  This         
              project will also investigate a simplification rule called contextual          
              rewriting, which identifies many unnecessary inferences and is more            
              powerful than demodulation and subsumption together.  The approach             
              taken in this project is based on well-founded term orderings, which           
              play a central role in the Knuth-Bendix completion procedure and               
              rewriting methods for equational reasoning.                                    
                                                                                             
              In this project, results of theoretical investigation will also be             
              implemented and experimented with in a software system called the              
              Rewrite Rule Laboratory (RRL), an environment for experimenting with           
              and developing new automated reasoning procedures based on rewrite             
              methods. This research will increase the power of RRL for solving              
              problems in verification and specification of hardware and software,           
              as well as those considered a challenge for automated theorem provers.
