Abstract    :
              Recent developments in nonlinear control                                       
              theory coupled with significant advances in                                    
              computing technology have made possible a new                                  
              era of control systems design.  Availing                                       
              ourselves of these advances, we seek to expand                                 
              the applicability of the theory toward an                                      
              eventual goal of a practicable design                                          
              methodology.  Using theoretical tools from                                     
              differential geometry, center manifolds, and                                   
              singular perturbations and aided by powerful                                   
              graphics and symbolic computational tools, we                                  
              will investigate:                                                              
                                                                                             
                 o     input-output approximations of                                        
                       nonlinear systems by nonlinear                                        
                       systems possessing desired regularity                                 
                       conditions, and                                                       
                                                                                             
                 o     the effect of system perturbations on                                 
                       the structure of MIMO nonlinear                                       
                       systems.                                                              
                                                                                             
              A better understanding of these areas will                                     
              make a significant contribution to the                                         
              theoretical understanding and practical design                                 
              of high performance nonlinear control systems.
