Abstract    :
              Improvements in microscopic data collection and analysis are                   
              needed for research activities of the faculty in the biological                
              sciences.  To replace obsolete facilities, improve instrumental                
              resolution, and increase operating efficiency, the PIs propose to              
              purchase a new scanning electron microscope and to equip the                   
              existing transmission electron microscope with an image                        
              acquisition system.  The latter will allow the PIs to link the                 
              transmission electron microscope/image acquisition system to the               
              University's computer network, including the Cray YMP                          
              supercomputer in Columbus, to facilitate work on the three-                    
              dimensional organization of large structures.  The proposed                    
              acquisition will enhance the research potential of several                     
              investigators and allow others to work on problems that cannot                 
              currently be addressed at all.  These purchases will complete the              
              process of upgrading the University's central microscopy                       
              resources and will enhance all the research programs that employ               
              microscopy as an essential tool.
