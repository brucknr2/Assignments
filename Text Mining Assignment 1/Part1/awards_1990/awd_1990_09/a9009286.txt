Abstract    :
              Many theoretical models in modern finance, organizational                      
              economics, information economics, and game theory rely heavily on              
              how individuals react to risk.  The purpose of this proposal is                
              to analyze risk preferences by the use of experimental methods in              
              a laboratory setting.  Specifically, experiments will be designed              
              and run with human subjects to determine the factors that govern               
              the experimentalist's ability to induce particular risk attitudes              
              for an experimental commodity, and then to compare this ability                
              to induce preferences to various techniques for the direct                     
              measurement of preferences over monetary gambles.  A better                    
              understanding the role of risk preferences is important not only               
              from a theoretical, but also from a practical standpoint.                      
              Recently, a plethora of institutional changes, ranging from                    
              computerized trading and new financial instruments to new                      
              regulatory rulings on trade inequities, have emerged.  The                     
              evaluation of these institutions has immense, practical import,                
              given the magnitude of resource transfers that occur in these                  
              institutions.
