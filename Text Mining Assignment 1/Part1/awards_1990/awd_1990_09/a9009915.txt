Abstract    :
                 This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Mauro to                    
              initiate independent studies aimed at correlating                              
              electrophysiological properties of keratinocytes with their                    
              capacity to differentiate and attempting to determine which                    
              membrane currents are important in keratinocyte differentiation.               
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that this award will help Dr. Mauro obtain the               
              preliminary results necessary to launch an independent research                
              career.
