Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a post-event investigation project to learn                            
              engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                   
              1989).                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is two-fold: to evaluate the                     
              performance of reinforced concrete buildings and to assess,                    
              through earthquake data analysis, the current vulnerability                    
              evaluation methods. Most specifically the document ATC-14                      
              which provides recommended methodologies for rapid assessment                  
              of life-safety level of performance of buildings will be                       
              evaluated.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The tasks undertaken in this investigation are: (a) collection                 
              and organization of structural performance data, (b) analysis                  
              and evaluation of structural vulnerability in the ATC-14                       
              format, and (c) evaluation of the ATC-14.                                      
                                                                                             
              The project will provide a rational verification with field                    
              data and improvements of structural safety evaluation                          
              methodology.
