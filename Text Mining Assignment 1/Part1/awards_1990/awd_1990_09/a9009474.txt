Abstract    :
              This project is a study of one-dimensional systems in which                    
              competing interactions with different length scales give rise to               
              a succession of commensurate and incommensurate phases.                        
              Their methods open up new possibilities for understanding                      
              commensurate-incommensurate phase transitions.  In this context                
              they will examine a selection of interesting and accessible                    
              problems:  non-convex interactions, multicritical points, mean-                
              field theories of selected models, modeling of a qusi-periodic                 
              potential, superconducting networks, mathematical correspondence               
              between ground states and more general equilibrium states.
