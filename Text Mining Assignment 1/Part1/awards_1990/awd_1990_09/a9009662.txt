Abstract    :
              There are four main objectives to this work.  The first is to provide          
              a better understanding of a new negative ion diagnostic procedure for          
              radio-frequency processing discharges.  This technique is based upon           
              direct ion mass spectrometry.  The second objective is to use this             
              diagnostic to probe technologically important discharges and determine         
              the negative ions identities and dependencies on externally controlled         
              parameters.  This information will be used to provide a more complete          
              understanding of negative ion kinetics and transport in the discharge.         
              Negative ions are being studied to determine whether or not they help          
              to produce gas-phase particulates (microcontamination) in the                  
              discharge.  This contamination can increase the failure rate of                
              semiconductor devices.  The fourth objective is to begin to                    
              investigate whether or not negative ions etch or deposit materials             
              better than their positive counterparts.  Mass spectrometric                   
              measurements of the neutrals and ions in the discharge in conjunction          
              with microwave measurements of the electron density and optical                
              measurements of radiating species will be combined to achieve the              
              goals for this research.
