Abstract    :
              The Research Initiation Award is to support an integrated study of             
              magneto-thermo-mechanical behavior of superconducting composite                
              solids.  An efficient and consistent finite element computational              
              method for solving the resulting nonlinear field equations will be             
              developed.
