Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses the control of nonlinearly flexible                     
              structures.  The intent is to determine stabilizing controls                   
              based on the energy-momentum methodology.  The system                          
              considered comprises a flexible assemblage and a controller.                   
              The demand is imposed that a specified state be an                             
              equilibrium state, and then the energy-momentum method is                      
              used to find conditions which the controller must satisfy,                     
              thus characterizing a class of stabilizing controllers.  A                     
              nonlinear model for the flexible appendage is used and                         
              imposes no restrictions on deformation.
