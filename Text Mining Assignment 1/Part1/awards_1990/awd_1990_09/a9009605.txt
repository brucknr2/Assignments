Abstract    :
              Preliminary studies will be performed to investigate the                       
              solution-state active-site structure of liver alcohol                          
              dehydrogenase (LADH) and its complexes with substrates,                        
              substrate analogs, and inhibitors.  The validity of the                        
              cadmium-substituted enzyme as a model for native                               
              zinc-containing LADH will be assessed 113Cd, 15N and 17O nuclear               
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  The feasibility of 17O                 
              and 67Zn NMR as methods to determine the nature of binding of                  
              substrate and water molecules to the active-site metal of                      
              native LADH will be assessed.
