Abstract    :
              This ROW planning grant is to use shape descriptors to                         
              characterize the bones of the wrist.  Finding a new way                        
              to "mark" abstract shapes for eventual characterization                        
              is intriguing, and may have general application in the                         
              area of image analysis.
