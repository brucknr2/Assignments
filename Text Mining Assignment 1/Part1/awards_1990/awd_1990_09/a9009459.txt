Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This a post-event investigation project to learn engineering                   
              lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October 1989).                        
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to improve the reliability                    
              of the existing earthquake loss estimation models based upon                   
              observations of the October 17 Loma Prieta earthquake.                         
              Research will be focused on two issues:                                        
                                                                                             
              *  the amplification of ground motion due to certain soil                      
                 conditions, and                                                             
                                                                                             
              *  a Bayesian update of the loss estimate matricies for                        
              various      classes of buildings.                                             
                                                                                             
              The study will comprise of four tasks:     (1) Data collecting                 
              and processing, (2) development of soil amplification model,                   
              (3) Bayesian update of intensity-damage relationships, and (4)                 
              calibration of the updated integrated loss estimation model                    
              developed earlier by the investigators at Stanford University.                 
                                                                                             
              A successful completion of the project will advance the state                  
              of the art in earthquake risk management to the benefit of all                 
              segments of society.
