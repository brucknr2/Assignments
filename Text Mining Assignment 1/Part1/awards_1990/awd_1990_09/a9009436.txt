Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project explores the unique properties of liquid                 
              crystals (LCs) as membrane barriers for electrical field-                      
              enhanced separation of fluid mixtures.  Such materials are                     
              organic molecules which form partially ordered phases.                         
              Application of an electric field to the LC can influences                      
              spatial order within the crystal, the most dramatic effect                     
              being a variety of electrohydrodynamic (EHD) instabilities and                 
              anisotropy.  In the presence of an electron this anisotropy                    
              produces current focus and space charge accumulation, which in                 
              turn leads to electric body forces and flow of the LC.  With                   
              appropriate parameter selection this flow can enhance the                      
              charge accumulator, a form of positive feedback, thus                          
              producing the instability.  Moreover, the result with a                        
              dynamic AC field is a series of bifurcations to chaotic                        
              turbulent flow as sub-micron dimensions.                                       
                                                                                             
              The EHD induced instability can be used to make structures                     
              exhibiting voltage controlled permeability.  Permeation across                 
              the membrane barrier occurs by diffuse flux which when                         
              subjected to the electric force produces a large controllable                  
              increase in the permeability of the LC layer.  For mixtures                    
              with different solubilities, the high permeability EHD state                   
              can become an effective and selective membrane for separation                  
              processes.  In addition, because of the enhanced transport                     
              induced across the barrier, the technique can be used as a                     
              "permeability switch" for providing a rapid, clean signal to a                 
              sensing element for on-demand sampling and analysis of process                 
              streams.
