Abstract    :
                   PI will investigate the timing and style of the initial                   
              opening of the Gulf of California.  Sediments, sedimentary                     
              structures, sediment provenance and age-dating will be used to                 
              constrain the times and patterns of rifting.  Elucidation of                   
              rifting in this region  will permit understanding of rifting in                
              other geologic settings and at other times.
