Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Movement by animals including man, requires precise timing                
              to be smooth and coordinated.  The neurons which control movement              
              have been in existence for millions of years and if we can                     
              understand how they work we will have fundamental knowledge for                
              understanding numerous aspects of movement from designing robots               
              to rehabilitating stroke victims.  The proposed study will focus               
              on one of the oldest vertebrates known . the lamprey.  Its                     
              nervous system has to provide accurate wave motions through                    
              pattern generating nerves which can be recorded in vitro.  Also                
              the lamprey undergoes a protracted larval phase during which the               
              pace maker neurons must change cell firing rates to maintain the               
              exact phase of the rhythm even though the neurons are growing                  
              longer and thereby taking longer to fire the muscle.  The study                
              will provide both basic biological data of the cell firing                     
              patterns during fictive swimming and also a mathematical analysis              
              of the stable and unstable patterns and phase shifts.  The work                
              should tell us much about very basic events in the control of                  
              movement.
