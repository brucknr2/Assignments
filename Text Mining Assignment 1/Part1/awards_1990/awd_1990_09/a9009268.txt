Abstract    :
                   Let M be an irreducible highest weight representation of an               
              affine Lie algebra. This project is concerned with the inner                   
              ideal geometry in M and the associated group G. The principal                  
              investigator will study the algebraic and topological structure                
              of M. She will also work on a characterization of the Kac-Moody                
              group associated with the affine Lie algebra in terms of inner                 
              ideal geometries. An explicit description of the inner ideal                   
              geometry associated with M will be derived.                                    
                   The research supported falls in the general area of                       
              geometric algebra which is concerned with vector spaces,                       
              coordinatization, and the transformation groups acting on the                  
              spaces. Questions concern both the underlying geometry and the                 
              algebra.
