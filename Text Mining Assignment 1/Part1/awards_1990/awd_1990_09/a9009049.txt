Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his work on topics               
              concerning the statistical behavior of systems with infinitely                 
              many degrees of freedom.  The principal focus will be on systems               
              which are homogeneously disordered such as Bernoulli percolation               
              and spin-glasses.  However, he will also study some questions                  
              involving uniform systems.  These problems will be studied with                
              rigorous methods rooted primarily in probability theory, making                
              use of renormalization group ideas and graphical (or stochastic                
              geometrical) techniques.  The subjects range from those which                  
              are of purely mathematical interest to some which have                         
              experimental ramifications.  This field is at the interface                    
              between mathematics and physics.
