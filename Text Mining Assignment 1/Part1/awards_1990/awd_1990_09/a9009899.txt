Abstract    :
              Plasmas have become important in materials processing because                  
              they can provide a highly chemically reactive environment                      
              while remaining at relatively low overall gas temperatures.                    
              One of the more common industrial reactors consists of radio                   
              frequency (RF) power capacitively coupled to two parallel                      
              plate electrodes.  The material to be processed is placed on                   
              one of the electrodes and the plasma generated in the fill gas                 
              provides the free radicals, ions and energetic neutrals needed                 
              for the particular chemical process.                                           
                                                                                             
              With this Career Advancement Award, the PI will design and                     
              construct a "standard" RF reference parallel plate reactor                     
              with maximum capability for diagnostics as well as certain                     
              characteristics desirable for modeling.  Specifically, the                     
              reactor will have the following properties                                     
              - RF power (capacitively coupled)            0 - 500 Watts                     
              - RF Frequency                               13.56 MHz                         
              - Electrode Spacing                          2.54 cm                           
              - argon                                      99.999%                           
              - Gas flow                                   2 - 20 sccm                       
              - Gas pressure                               0.1 -1.0 Torr                     
              The diagnostics she plans to measure include: (1) the first                    
              five harmonics, magnitude and phase of the voltage and current                 
              at both electrodes, (2) spatial and temporal measurements of                   
              the visible optical emission, (3) spatial measurements of                      
              eletron temperature and density, and (4) spatial measurements                  
              of the electron energy distribution function.  The results of                  
              these measurements will be compared to measurements taken on                   
              another reactor on the University of Michigan campus.  Once                    
              the standard reactor is fully characterized, it will be used                   
              as for comparison in the modeling and experimental study and                   
              analysis of industrial reactors.  The grant will advance the                   
              career of the PI by providing her initial experience in a new                  
              line of research on which future projects can be based.
