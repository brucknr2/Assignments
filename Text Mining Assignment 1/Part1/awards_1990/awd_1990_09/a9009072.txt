Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to conduct geotechnical regional              
              workshops for the practicing geotechnical engineer to provide input            
              and direction to the research community in designing research                  
              programs to meet the needs of the practitioner while advancing the             
              state-of-the-art of the profession.  Four regional locations,                  
              representing substantially different geotechnical conditions and               
              levels of practice, will be chosen:  Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, and              
              San Francisco.  The workshops will be structured to invite                     
              practitioners with a mix of geotechnical disciplines.
