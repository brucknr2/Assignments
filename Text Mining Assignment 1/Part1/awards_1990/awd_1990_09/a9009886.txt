Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop a new system for measuring                       
              blood flow using Doppler ultrasound. Repeated pulses,                          
              consisting of synchronous swept-frequency sinusoids, are                       
              used for excitation.  After appropriate processing of the                      
              reflected signal (which may include correlation with the                       
              excitation waveform), both depth and velocity information                      
              can be recovered.  The proposed system includes software                       
              cancellation of stationary tissue structures, allowing a                       
              substantial increase in the signal-to-noise ratio for                          
              weak flow signals.  If successful, the work will open up                       
              new research and diagnostic avenues by facilitating the                        
              determination of flow in small arteries and peripheral                         
              vasculature.
