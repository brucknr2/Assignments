Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Regional patterns of climate and environmental response in                
              southwestern North America during the pivotal millennia of the end of          
              the Pleistocene epoch, and the relations of that regional pattern to           
              global climate change continue to be nationally and internationally            
              important research topics.  The Sierra Nevadas of eastern California           
              are a major climatic and vegetational boundary today, but at the end of        
              the last ice age Great Basin-like vegetation coverered lower slopes on         
              both sides of the southern Sierra Nevada.  In this project, the                
              investigator will collect, date, and examine lake-core chronologies            
              from four lakes west of the Sierra crest in eastern Calfornia in order         
              to evaluate two competing hypotheses that explain why the western              
              Sierra was drier and the eastern Sierra was wetter at the end of the           
              last glacial period.  The first hypothesis argues that enhanced                
              monsoonal activity was due to greater summer insolation and an enhanced        
              land-sea thermal contrast.  The second alternative explains the                
              northern aridity and the southern moistness by a southward displacement        
              of the winter jet stream.                                                      
                                                                                             
                   The study will illuminate our understanding of the late Quaternary        
              vegetation history of arid North America and the climatic patterns that        
              have influenced it.  This knowledge will increase our understanding of         
              processes of climatic and vegetation change and the ways the regional          
              changes relate to global changes.
