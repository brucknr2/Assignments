Abstract    :
              The development of parallel and vector                                         
              algorithms for solving very large                                              
              matrix algebraic Riccati equations is                                          
              proposed. The approach to be used                                              
              stresses the use of computational                                              
              kernels such as the BLAS3, which are                                           
              available on a wide variety of                                                 
              parallel computers.  This approach                                             
              will make the algorithms portable to                                           
              many advanced scientific computers.                                            
              Much of the research is based on the                                           
              matrix sign function algorithm, an                                             
              iterative method that has been shown                                           
              to work well on a certain class of                                             
              multiprocessor.  Topics  for research                                          
              include easily parallelized                                                    
              "multiplication rich" algorithms,                                              
              parallel and vector algorithms for                                             
              several different advanced computer                                            
              architectures, a condition estimate                                            
              computable using the matrix sign                                               
              function, and iterative algorithms for                                         
              solving the linear Lyapunov equation.                                          
              Finally, implementation of the                                                 
              algorithms as high quality, reliable                                           
              mathematical software is proposed, in                                          
              order to make the results of the                                               
              research available for use by the                                              
              control systems community.  The                                                
              solution of algebraic Riccati
