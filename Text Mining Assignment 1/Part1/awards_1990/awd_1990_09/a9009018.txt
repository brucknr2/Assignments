Abstract    :
              This work addresses fundamental problems in three facets of                    
              discourse processing, (1) the focus of attention of discourse                  
              participants, (2) the use and understanding of pronominal                      
              reference, and (3) the coherence of discourse.  The research                   
              focuses on the interaction among these facets within a discourse               
              segment.  It will refine and expand current computational                      
              theories of discourse coherence and reference at this local                    
              level.  The approach is interdisciplinary:  it includes the                    
              development of algorithms that embody the theory and                           
              psychological investigations to determine constraints on                       
              parameters of the theory (e.g. the ordering of candidate                       
              referents for pronouns).  It will empirically test the claims of               
              the theory as a model of human language use, and will compare the              
              performance of algorithms for handling pronouns employing the                  
              constraints of this theory with alternatives based on other                    
              theories.  The results will contribute to computer science and                 
              the cognitive sciences in three major arenas:  the construction                
              of more fluent and robust natural-language processing systems;                 
              the development of more computationally sufficient psychological               
              theories of discourse processing; and, potentially in the longer               
              term, the design of more sophisticated computer languages (e.g.                
              database-access languages, system-interface languages).
