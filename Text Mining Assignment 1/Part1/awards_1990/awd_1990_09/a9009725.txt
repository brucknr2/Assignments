Abstract    :
              Bioremediation is an emerging technology which exploits                        
              the natural degradative processes of microorganisms for                        
              the purpose of cleaning up chemical wastes.  Although                          
              several case studies have reported impressive results, for                     
              example the restoration of the Alaskan coastline following                     
              the recent oil spill, the processes controlling the rates                      
              of chemical degradation are not well understood.  One                          
              aspect which has not been fully investigated is the role                       
              of bacterial population migration.  Motile bacteria are                        
              able to move in response to chemical gradients toward                          
              beneficial substances and away from substances which may                       
              be detrimental to their survival.  The purpose of this                         
              study is to determine the significance of bacterial                            
              migration in bioremediation processes and its potential                        
              for accelerating the overall rate of chemical degradation.                     
                                                                                             
              Experimental studies will measure bacterial motility and                       
              chemotaxis in terms of population parameters derived from                      
              known cell mechanisms for a model system such as                               
              Pseudomonas and benzene.  These parameters will be                             
              incorporated into mathematical models describing bacterial                     
              population dynamics to determine their effect on the                           
              population.  The results will be used to determine the                         
              feasibility of this type of study and approach and also                        
              provide direction for the development of a research                            
              program in the area of bioremediation.
