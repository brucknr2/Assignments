Abstract    :
              This research program involves theoretical investigations of the               
              nonequilibrium transport phenomena of charged particles under the              
              influence of rapidly space-time varying fields in rf discharges.  The          
              program has two objectives:  first, obtain a nonequilibrium fluid              
              description of the behavior of charged particles in terms of density,          
              mean energy, and average velocity; this nonequilibrium fluid                   
              description is able to model the ballistic transport phenomena in              
              rapidly space-time varying fields and will be compared to a kinetic            
              description and experimental results to assess the validity of the             
              description; secondly, develop a parallelized code on CRAY X-MP/24 to          
              self-consistently simulate the transport of charged particles in the           
              rf discharges of the Gaseous Electronics Conference RF Reference Cell          
              multidimensionally based on the nonequilibrium fluid description and           
              compare the simulation results with experimental results.  Successful          
              completion of this investigation will contribute to the understanding          
              of the nonequilibrium transport phenomena of charged particles in rf           
              discharges and to the design of rf plasma processing reactors.
