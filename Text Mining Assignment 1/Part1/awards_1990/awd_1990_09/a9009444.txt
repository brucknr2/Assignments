Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is part of the NSF/USGS                                           
              initiative within the National Earthquake                                      
              Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to                                            
              investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta                                     
              earthquake of 17 October 1989.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This project involves extensive measurements                                   
              of long-period microtremors in the San                                         
              Francisco basin.  Microtremors, or                                             
              microseisms, are small tremors or vibrations                                   
              of the earth that are generated by natural                                     
              occurrences such as the pounding of surf on                                    
              the shore, or road traffic.  They can be                                       
              detected only by sensitive instruments and                                     
              are not associated with earthquakes, but may                                   
              be used to understand better the process of                                    
              ground shaking due to earthquakes.  The aim                                    
              is to investigate the use of long-period                                       
              microtremors in the San Francisco basin to                                     
              identify "critical" structures having a                                        
              natural frequency of vibration close to that                                   
              of the predominant motion of the basin.                                        
                                                                                             
              The program consists of three phases: (1) The                                  
              measurement of long-period microtremors at                                     
              approximately 30 locations within the basin,                                   
              with some of the sites coinciding with the                                     
              locations were strong motion records were                                      
              obtained during the Loma Prieta earthquake,                                    
              (2) processing these data, and (3) analyzing                                   
              these data and comparing them with the strong                                  
              ground motion records obtained during the                                      
              Loma Prieta earthquake.  Special emphasis is                                   
              being given to the Marina district which                                       
              consists of very soft sediments and in which                                   
              considerable damage occurred.                                                  
                                                                                             
              All recorded data are being stored on floppy                                   
              disks, which will be available upon request.                                   
              In addition, the records will be accessible                                    
              through electronic mail.
