Abstract    :
              A standard for multichip module (MCM) packages is proposed called "Tiny        
              Packages".  This is to be used by university researchers in VLSI               
              subsystem design using multichip modules (MCMs).  The goal is for              
              fabrication to be done through MOSIS in a similar manner to the use of         
              the "Tiny Chips" standard at the single chip level.  The first version         
              of public domain computer aided design (CAD) tools for MCM design is           
              developed making use of the "Tiny Packages" standard.  These tools             
              optimize the placement of chips on the substrate and the multilayered          
              routing of substrate interconnections to exploit MCM high-performance          
              potential.  The utility of these tools will be refined and validated by        
              application to the re-packaging of a commercial digital signal processor       
              (DSP) printed circuit board.  The relative features and performance of         
              the two designs will be compared.  At no cost AT&T will provide the            
              unmounted chips, fabricate the MCMs designed, then assemble and test the       
              resultant redesign.
