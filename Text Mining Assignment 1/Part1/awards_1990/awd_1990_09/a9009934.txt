Abstract    :
              This proposal is to develop a novel approach to the                            
              eventual design of a hand prosthesis.  The PIs will first                      
              develop a formal model of grasping behavior based upon                         
              experiments on humans.  They will then formulate a                             
              minimal set of control inputs that is necessary to                             
              control grasping movements.  Finally, both neural network                      
              and knowledge-based approaches will be investigated as                         
              possible methods of implementing intelligent control                           
              mechanisms for an already developed hand prosthesis.  The                      
              proposed work should lead to better ways of controlling                        
              artificial hands; it also may have an impact on the                            
              design of robotic manipulators.
