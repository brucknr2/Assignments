Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study the implications in                 
              mathematical physics of the minimal representation of SO(4,4),                 
              completely integrable systems using "pairs of Hamiltonian                      
              operators," G-invariant differential operators on the nil-cone,                
              and Lusztig's basis theorem.                                                   
                   The project to be undertaken by the principal investigator                
              involves techniques from group theory and will have consequences               
              in mathematical physics.  A group is an abstract algebraic                     
              concept which simply involves a collection of numbers or                       
              variables and a prescribed manner of combining them which obeys                
              certain rules.  The integers with the operation of addition is an              
              example of a group.  By the 1970s mathematical physicists                      
              understood that relationships between subatomic particles could                
              be described using the group theory which had been studied for                 
              many years by algebraists.
