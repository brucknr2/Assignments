Abstract    :
                   The survey, a vital element in NSF's efforts to measure                   
              scientific and technological activities in industry, collects                  
              data on dollar volume of research and development, sources of                  
              financing, employment of R&D scientists and engineers, and                     
              other economic characteristics of industrial R&D performance.                  
              The contractor will produce detailed statistical tables                        
              displaying survey results.                                                     
                   As part of its requirement under the National Science                     
              Foundation Act, as amended, to provide a central clearinghouse                 
              for the collection, interpretation and analysis of data on the                 
              current and projected availability of scientific and                           
              technical resources in the United States, NSF collects and                     
              disseminates statistical data on detailed characteristics of                   
              industrial R&D spending and employment of scientists and                       
              engineers.  The data collected in this survey are published as                 
              tables and used in analytical reports; they provide policy                     
              makers with a broad range of statistical information for                       
              industrial research and development spending and employment.
