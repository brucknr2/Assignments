Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award is for development of potential-                
              field methods of guiding a polygonal robot among unknown 3-D                   
              obstacles, where inputs are limited to touch or to limited-range               
              non-contact sensors.  Using only local information, the robot                  
              must reach a desired location or determine that it is impossible               
              to do so.  Techniques from computational geometry will be                      
              combined with those of potential-based motion planning, extending              
              Dr. Cox's constraint-network approach to handle additional                     
              degrees of freedom.
