Abstract    :
              An understanding of how tracking in middle and secondary schools               
              affects student learning is critical for informed decision-making              
              about tracking practices.  This study will show how tracking                   
              affects students who differ by gender, race, and prior                         
              achievement.  Thus, it will reveal a source of potential                       
              inequities in our educational system.  The research will also                  
              demonstrate how variation between schools in tracking structures               
              and placement policies is a major, though largely ignored, source              
              of school differences in students learning.  The conceptual model              
              will be tested on longitudinal data from two cohorts of about                  
              2,100 students each, in several public, parochial, and private                 
              middle and secondary schools.  Seventh through tenth grade data                
              have already been collected on these students.  The investigator               
              will collect information on their last two years in high school                
              in this study.  She will conduct descriptive and inferential                   
              analyses to reveal the mechanisms that relate middle school                    
              tracking to opportunities for learning in high school.
