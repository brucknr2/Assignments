Abstract    :
              This proposal offers significant new insights into organizational              
              learning and the transfer of knowledge within organizations.  Large            
              increases in productivity have been observed as manufacturing units            
              gain experience in production.  These learning curves have been                
              observed in many organizations.  The proposed research extends the             
              analysis of learning to quality -- a variable that has become                  
              increasingly important to a firm's competitiveness.                            
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose: (1) to evaluate the                 
              transfer of learning across shifts in a plant, and (2) to analyze              
              the link between quality and production experience.  They plan to              
              investigate the rate at which quality improves with experience,                
              whether quality improvements persist over time, and whether such               
              improvements can be transferred.  The proposed research will                   
              advance scientific knowledge about learning curves in manufacturing            
              organizations.  This information should enable firms to improve                
              their productivity and the quality of their product, and hence to              
              compete more effectively.
