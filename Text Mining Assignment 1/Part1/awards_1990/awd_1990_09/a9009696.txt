Abstract    :
              The idea of median filters can be generalized so as to lead to nonlinear       
              filters that include as a special case order statistic filters (Ll-            
              estimators).  Such filters can be very efficient in processing signals         
              of nongaussian nature and can be constrained to be robust against the          
              presence of occasional impulsive disturbances.  The coefficients of the        
              filter can be computed adaptively using extension of LMS and RLS               
              algorithm.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project is involved in deepening the understanding of the                 
              properties of the generalized filters, particularly when used in an            
              adaptive signal processing framework.  Preliminary results show very           
              promising performance.  The impact of the study can be considerable in         
              the signal processing practice since all linear digital filters                
              (recursive and nonrecursive) could be upgraded with small computational        
              increase to be also order statistic filters.  Robustness and improved          
              performance would easily be gained in presence of nongaussian signals.
