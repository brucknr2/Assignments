Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Although much attention has focused on the genetic control of                  
              development in the central nervous system of Drosophila,                       
              development of the neuromusular system is largely unexplored.                  
              The proposed research seeks to identify the precursor cells that               
              differentiate during metamorphosis to form the thoracic muscles                
              mediating the escape response.  The large size of metamorphosing               
              flies, relative to embryos, makes their developing muscles ideal               
              for physiological testing, anatomical analyses, and surgical                   
              intervention.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The investigators will follow during metamorphosis the                         
              differentiation of normal muscle precursors, determine which                   
              developmental steps are perturbed in mutant flies lacking escape-              
              response muscles, and identify the function(s) controlled by the               
              wild-type alleles of the mutant genes.                                         
                                                                                             
              To further characterize the action(s) of genetic mutations that                
              prevent formation of muscles or cause them to degenerate                       
              prematurely, the investigators will test whether transplanted                  
              muscle precursors reverse mutant defects.  Results from these                  
              experiments should help to determine whether defects in muscles                
              or in neurons innervating muscles cause muscle deficiencies.                   
              This information should enable the investigators in future to                  
              identify the gene products that are required to complete the                   
              complex process of muscle formation.
