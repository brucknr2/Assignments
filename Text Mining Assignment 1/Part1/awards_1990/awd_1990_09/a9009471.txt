Abstract    :
                   This proposal supports a symposium entitled Computing                     
              Science and Statistics: Symposium on the Interface, and subtitled              
              Statistics on Many Parameters: Curves, Images, Spatial Models.                 
              The conference is to be held 17-19 May 1990 at the Kellogg Center              
              at Michigan State University.  This is the 1990 version of a                   
              continuing series of symposia sponsored by The American                        
              Statistical Association, the Institute of Mathematical                         
              Statistics, and the Society for Industrial and Applied                         
              Mathematics.  This series provides an opportunity for                          
              professionals in statistics, computing science, and numerical                  
              methods to interact. This particular conference is intended to be              
              a showpiece for the computer-video presentation of statistical                 
              and numerical research on problems involving curves, images, and               
              spatial models.
