Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will initiate a study of multiple              
              self-intersecting closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces.  This               
              will include an investigation into a systematic method for                     
              determining the existence of permanent triple points.  The method              
              involves the application of trace identities between matrices in               
              SL(2,C) representing hyperbolic isometries.  Trace polynomials                 
              will also be used.                                                             
                   Geodesics, which may lie along surfaces, are generalizations              
              of the concept of a straight line.  The great circles are the                  
              geodesics on a sphere.  These are called closed geodesics because              
              they eventually retrace themselves.  For many years, geometers                 
              have studied the problem of classifying and counting the numbers               
              of closed geodesics on other surfaces such as the torus. The                   
              principal investigator's project is related to this continuing                 
              study.
