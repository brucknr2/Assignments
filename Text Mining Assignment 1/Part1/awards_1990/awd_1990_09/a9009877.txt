Abstract    :
                   This study is developing adaptive error control algorithms                
              for nonstationary communication channels with feedback.  The                   
              feedback channel allows for the flow of channel state information              
              from the receiver to the transmitter.  The transmitter uses this               
              information to reconfigure data structures in accordance with                  
              variations in channel noise and attenuation.                                   
                   There are three basic questions that are being considered in              
              the development of the adaptive algorithms.  First, how can the                
              receiver derive channel state information from received data                   
              blocks?  secondly, how can the receiver use the feedback channel               
              to report this information to the transmitter?  Finally, how is                
              the transmitter to react to this information?
