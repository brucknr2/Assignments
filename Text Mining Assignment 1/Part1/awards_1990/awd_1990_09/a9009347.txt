Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposal is to characterize internal damage in particle                    
              reinforced composite materials, including thermomechanical                     
              behavior, micro-mechanics and continuum mechanics approaches.                  
              The objective is to develop models which captures the                          
              fundamental mechanics phenomena and yet simple enough for                      
              implementation.
