Abstract    :
              Under a Career Advancement Award, ROW, a previously developed                  
              micromechanical theory for flow of granular materials will be                  
              extended to describe flows of interacting fluid-solid                          
              mixtures.  A corresponding experimental project is to be                       
              carried out by the investigator while on sabbatical leave in                   
              Sweden.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Two-phase flows of particles and fluids occur in a broad range                 
              of mechanical and chemical engineering systems, and this                       
              research will enhance their more accurate predictability.
