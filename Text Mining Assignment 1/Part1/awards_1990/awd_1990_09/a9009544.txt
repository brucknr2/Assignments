Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigators will determine what role cell lineage plays in               
              the specification of cell fate during vertebrate neuronal                      
              development.  They will study the early embryo of the zebrafish,               
              in which they can mark individual cells, transplant them, and                  
              follow them as they develop in living embryos.  They have shown                
              previously that gastrula cells generate clones restricted to                   
              single tissues, yet if the cells are transplanted, they produce                
              new lineages.  The early cells, therefore, may express position-               
              specific developmental programs that determine their early                     
              behavior, but do not restrict their potential.  To further our                 
              understanding of the developmental roles of cell lineage, the                  
              investigators will study in vivo the lineages that normally arise              
              from singly marked cells, learning the patterns of division,                   
              movements, and lineage relationships of a variety of cell types,               
              including identified neurons.  To investigate cellular                         
              commitments and clues provided by the environment, they will                   
              examine lineages and fates of cells transplanted individually                  
              between embryos.
