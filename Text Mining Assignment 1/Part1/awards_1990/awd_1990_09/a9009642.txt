Abstract    :
              The wear of polymers and polymer composites will be studied in                 
              order to further develop a model for wear debris generation.                   
              Transfer film formation will be followed and related to surface                
              preparation techniques.  These will be designed to impart                      
              controlled surface features.  The wear by surface cracking for                 
              sliding against very smooth counterfaces will also be studied.                 
              The findings will be related to a model based on two-                          
              dimensional non-Hertzian stress systems.
