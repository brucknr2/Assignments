Abstract    :
                   Vector Quantization (VQ) is a source coding technique that                
              is emerging as a fundamental component in many speech and video                
              coding systems, particularly for low rate efficient transmission               
              over limited capacity communication channels.  The principal                   
              investigator is investigating and developing combined VQ and                   
              channel coding algorithms that substantially advance the current               
              performance achievable with respect to the overall reproduction                
              quality of the signal in a narrowband channel or packet network                
              environment.                                                                   
                   In many applications limited bandwidth constraints make                   
              impractical the use of traditional channel coding techniques.                  
              The algorithms being studied will combine basic VQ compression                 
              techniques for voice and video applications with new channel                   
              coding schemes that use little or no redundancy information.                   
              The project will examine in depth and develop new source/channel               
              techniques for VQ, exploiting combined quantization and                        
              modulation, packet error recovery, index permutations, and                     
              selective bit protection.  In addition, a theoretical analysis of              
              the performance of VQ in the presence of channel noise for                     
              asymptotically high resolution quantizers is being studied, which              
              can lead to better understanding for quantizer design procedures.
