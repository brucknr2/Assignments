Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is focused on the development of a computer                      
              assisted model to predict when and how people will cluster into                
              groups and polarize.  At issue is the question, under what                     
              conditions will people prove susceptible, or resistent, to the                 
              persuasive attempts of the majority or minority groups.  The                   
              model developed in this proposal has shown that with only a small              
              amount of information, changes in group attitude structure can be              
              predicted with a high degree of accuracy.  This research, if                   
              successful, will assist considerably in understanding the manner               
              in which groups influence individuals, and also the manner in                  
              which individuals influence groups.  These issues are fundamental              
              to almost all of social psychology, and as such, the research                  
              promises to have a great impact throughout the field.  This                    
              research promises to contribute to both theory and application in              
              social research.
