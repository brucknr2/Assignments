Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses issues in heteroepitaxy through research                
              into MBE growth and detailed characterization of epitaxial                     
              fluoride buffer films on silicon substrates, and subsequent                    
              overgrowth with III-V materials (GaAs, InGaAs).  The aim is to                 
              understand how to tailor and control defects in the overlayers by              
              using such buffer films.  A general goal of the project is to                  
              study heteroepitaxy from the point of view of engineering ideal                
              substrates for semiconductor materials used in photonic and                    
              electronic applications.
