Abstract    :
              An important aspect of a parallel architecture is the interconnection          
              network, which can be represented as a graph.  Many graphs have been           
              proposed as suited to parallel computation.  Previous research has             
              partially answered the questions of which graphs to use for which              
              problems and of which graphs are most generally useful for parallel            
              processing.  What has been lacking are uniform techniques and a                
              comprehensive theory for analyzing parallel networks.                          
                                                                                             
              The central thesis of this research project is that analogies to the           
              mathematical theory of algebraic topology can provide a foundation for         
              a theory of parallel networks.  New topologies for graphs are defined          
              that capture the essence of the graphs as parallel networks.                   
              Topological invariants are defined that facilitate comparison and              
              evaluation of networks, and efficient algorithms are given to compute          
              these invariants.  The standard technique for simulating one parallel          
              network by another is via graph embeddings.  In the topological                
              framework, a graph embedding is a special kind of continuous function          
              between topolical spaces.  Algorithms are given to compute the                 
              homotopology and homology groups of a graph and to compute the group           
              homomorphisms induced by a graph embedding.  Techniques are developed          
              to prove upper and lower bounds on the ability of one network to               
              simulate another.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The ultimate result of this research is a unified mathematical theory          
              of graphs as parallel architectures.
