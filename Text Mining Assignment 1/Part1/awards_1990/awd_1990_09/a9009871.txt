Abstract    :
              This research investigates the effects of clathrate                            
              hydrate formation in reversed micellar solutions on the                        
              solubility and conformation of proteins.  Preliminary                          
              results show that hydrate formation can, under certain                         
              conditions, effect protein solubilization into micelles                        
              when conventional phase transfer methods prove                                 
              ineffective.  It has also been found that hydrate                              
              formation is a method of in-situ modification of micelle                       
              size, and  thereby, of protein conformation and enzyme                         
              activity.  Therefore a set of related studies is proposed                      
              that exploit these concepts to enhance protein extraction                      
              into reversed micelles, and recovery in appropriate form.                      
                                                                                             
              The use of hydrates to alter the catalytic activity of                         
              enzymes in reversed micelles is also proposed.  The                            
              phenomenon of hydrate formation in reversed micelles is                        
              essentially unstudied up to the present.  To a large                           
              extent, this research is phenomenological, and certain                         
              aspects are exploratory.
