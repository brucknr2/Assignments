Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the representation theory of              
              artin algebras. The principal investigator will study idempotent               
              ideals and other generalizations of quasihereditary algebras and               
              their usefulness in the reduction of problems to algebras with                 
              fewer simple modules. She will also study contravariantly finite               
              subcategories of finitely generated modules over artin algebras                
              with regard to the finitestic global dimension conjecture and                  
              existence of almost split sequences.                                           
                   This research is in the general area of ring theory. A ring               
              is an algebraic structure having both an addition and a                        
              multiplication defined on it. These objects arise naturally and                
              are important in many areas of mathematics and physics.
