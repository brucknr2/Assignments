Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              People can learn that different events are interchangeable                     
              because they essentially "mean the same thing."  Such "stimulus                
              equivalences" are one means by which people can respond                        
              immediately and appropriately to new situations on the basis of                
              learning and experience in other situations.  This characteristic              
              of behavior is often regarded as special, and maybe unique, to                 
              human beings.  Is language necessary for this important                        
              behavioral attribute?  If animals without language can learn                   
              stimulus equivalences, language is not necessary.                              
                                                                                             
              Dr. Urcuioli, in collaboration with Dr. Thomas R. Zentall, of the              
              University of Kentucky, will examine this question using pigeons               
              as the experimental animal.  Well-established training techniques              
              and the excellent visual abilities of pigeons make them a most                 
              appropriate choice.  The pigeons will first be taught that                     
              certain (visual) stimuli go with other (visual) stimuli.  Later,               
              they will be tested to see if, as a result of that training, they              
              have learned that those stimuli belong to the same "group" or                  
              "class."  To do this, they will be taught in a second phase to                 
              match new stimuli to some of the stimuli with which they were                  
              originally trained.  Then, their ability to match the remaining                
              training stimuli to the new ones introduced in the second phase                
              will be measured.  Successful performance during this latter                   
              (test) phase would show that pigeons, like humans, can form                    
              stimulus equivalences or stimulus classes.                                     
                                                                                             
              If this ability can be established, it would mean that human                   
              language is not necessary for this important behavioral                        
              attribute.  It would also encourage scientists to study more                   
              intensively in the laboratory just how this supposedly special                 
              human characteristic comes about.
