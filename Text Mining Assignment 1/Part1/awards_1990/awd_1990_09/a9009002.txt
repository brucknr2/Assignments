Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for the purchase and construction of two                   
              greenhouses with an attached headhouse and an indoor                           
              environmentally controlled growth facility consisting of three                 
              growth rooms and 12 growth chambers.  The greenhouses are                      
              designed to be easily modified to conform to potential future                  
              regulations for the propagation of transgenic plants.  Three                   
              rooms within one of the houses will be equipped with refrigerated              
              cooling to provide temperature reduction during summer months.                 
              The growth rooms and growth chambers will be located within the                
              University's new BioScience Complex.  They will provide                        
              relatively large amounts of environmentally controlled space for               
              routine plant growth.  The chambers will provide greater and more              
              precise ranges of temperature (100  to 400 C) and light (0 to 1200             
              micro mol/photons m-2 s-1 at growth height) for more rigorously                
              defined growth requirements.  Major projects utilizing the                     
              proposed new facilities include:  hybridization in natural plant               
              populations (Arnold); regulation of gene active in later                       
              embryogensis (Galau); breedng structure and gene flow in plant                 
              populations (Hamrick); genetic and environmental control of                    
              flower development (Malmberg); differential expression of two                  
              multigene families (Meagher); environmental effects on heat shock              
              and auxin regulation (Nagao); phytochrome structure and                        
              functional relationships in transgenic plants (Pratt);                         
              photosynthetic acclimation in C3 plants (Sage); transposable                   
              elements in maize and rice (Wessler); and moss phylogeny and                   
              paternity in milkweeds (Wyatt).
