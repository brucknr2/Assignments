Abstract    :
              This is a Career Advancement Award which will allow the                        
              investigator to study game theory. The retooling will increase                 
              the investigator's ability to perform research in a wide variety               
              of fields and substantially increase the methodological tools in               
              her specific area of expertise - international research and                    
              development.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The project she hopes to work on will focus on the differences                 
              between the U.S. and European patent systems, their respective                 
              effects on when corporations file for patent protection and                    
              ultimately whether one system induces greater research and                     
              development expenditures in the private system as well as higher               
              social welfare. The major difference between the U.S. and                      
              European systems is the rule upon which a firm is awarded a                    
              patent when more than one firm is applying. The U.S. patent law                
              awards the patent to the firm that can prove it conceived  of the              
              idea first, whereas in Europe and most of the work, the patent is              
              awarded to the firm that applies for a patent first, independent               
              of who conceived of the idea first.
