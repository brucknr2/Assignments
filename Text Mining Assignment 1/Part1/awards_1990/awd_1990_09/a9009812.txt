Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is necessary for the normal development              
              and survival of nerve cells in the peripheral and central nervous              
              system.  The cellular mechanisms through which NGF elicits its                 
              effects are unknown.  The discovery of a protein kinase, which is              
              activated by NGF, may play an important role as a transducer of                
              signals derived from NGF's interaction with cell receptors.  Dr.               
              Landreth has previously characterized and purified this protein                
              kinase known as MAP2 by the enzyme's ability to phosphorylate                  
              microtubule associated protein 2.  This research project will                  
              determine how the protein kinase is activated.  It has been                    
              established that MAP2 kinase is activated through phosphorylation              
              by an unidentified kinase.  The mechanism of MAP2 kinase                       
              activation will be investigated by transfecting PC12 cells with                
              oncogenes that encode kinases for the amino acids serine and                   
              threonine.  The biological function of MAP2 kinase will be                     
              studied by creating mutant cells which lack MAP2 kinase.  This                 
              will be accomplished by utilizing antisense RNA or DNA molecules               
              which specifically block the synthesis of the MAP2 kinase.  This               
              examination will analyze whether kinase deficient cells respond                
              to NGF by activation of other protein kinases.  Results from this              
              study will provide additional information on the function of NGF               
              in the nervous system.
