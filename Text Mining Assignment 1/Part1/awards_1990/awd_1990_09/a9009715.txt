Abstract    :
              This project develops and analyzes a longitudinal data set on the              
              political geography of Nazi Party membership in Weimar Germany.                
              Names of more than 31,000 early Nazi members will constitute the               
              data set when completed.  The data will permit test of hypotheses              
              derived from rational choice models of behavior, to assess the                 
              adequacy of that type of explanaiton for political extremism.                  
              The storage, cleaning and checking, restructuring, maintenance,                
              and analysis of data will make a valuable resource for secondary               
              analyses of Nazi membership records.
