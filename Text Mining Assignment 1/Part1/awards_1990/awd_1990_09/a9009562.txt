Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In recent work it has been suggested that many of the unusual                  
              and attractive properties of supercritical fluids (SCF's),                     
              including enhanced solubilities may be explained by solvent                    
              and entrainer clustering around the solute that result in                      
              local densities and concentrations that are greater than the                   
              bulk.  It is proposed in a three part program to take                          
              advantage of this clustering in reactions and crystallization                  
              processes:  First, to experimentally determine the effect on                   
              the reaction rate of operating in the region near the critical                 
              point where entrainers cluster around the solute, which would                  
              increase local reactant concentrations:  Next, to determine                    
              the effect of varying upstream conditions on the                               
              characteristics of solid particles formed from the expansion                   
              of SCF solutions:  And, finally, to develop a                                  
              chemical/physical theory equation of state to describe SCF                     
              phase equilibrium with entrainers present, as encountered in                   
              the above two processes, as well as in simple extractions.                     
              The overall results of this work will be better use of the                     
              unique microscopic properties SCF solvents for reactions and                   
              crystallization processes, as well as a more realistically-                    
              based and reliable thermodynamic model upon which to design                    
              these processes.
