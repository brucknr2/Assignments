Abstract    :
              This project is a study of microscopic models of incommensurate                
              phases and phase transitions of various types, along with                      
              development of new mathematical and computational procedures for               
              problems of this sort.  Specific systems of interest are:  models              
              of entropically stabilized quasicrystal phases including                       
              "realistic" atomic models in two and three dimensions,                         
              antiferromagnetic Potts models which are studied using new Monte               
              Carlo simulation methods, properties of lattice models of dimers               
              using replica Monte Carlo techniques, development of high-                     
              efficiency algorithms for computer simulation of large molecules               
              (polymers, proteins, etc.).
