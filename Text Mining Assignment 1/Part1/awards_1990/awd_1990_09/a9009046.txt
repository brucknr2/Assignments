Abstract    :
                   In recent years microscopic study of wear patterns on molar               
              teeth has provided useful inferences on the diet of fossil                     
              hominoids.  This is the first attempt to reconstruct dietary                   
              information from the analysis of anterior (incisor) teeth.                     
              Central incisors of four sympatric primate species form Sumatra                
              (Macaca fascicularis, Presbytis thomasi, Hylobates lar, and Pongo              
              pygmaeus) will be examined by scanning electron microscopy.                    
              Features will be quantified using a semi-automated image analysis              
              procedure, and species will be compared on the basis of revealed               
              dental microwear patterns.  These patterns will be use to                      
              generate predictions concerning degree of incisor use, items                   
              contracting these teeth, and type of ingestive behavior.                       
              Resulting predictions will be evaluated by observing the same                  
              four living primate species in their natural habitat at Ketambe,               
              in northern Sumatra.  The proposed research will (1) introduce a               
              precise an rapid procedure for the quantification of dental                    
              microwear, (2) provide data on incisor microwear and tooth use                 
              among Sumatran primates, and (3) determine associations between                
              incisor use and microwear so that the former may be predicted for              
              the latter.  Such associations will facilitate dietary inferences              
              for fossil incisors.
