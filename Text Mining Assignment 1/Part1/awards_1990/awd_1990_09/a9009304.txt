Abstract    :
              A sheet of light from an Argon ion laser will be used to                       
              visualize the gas-liquid two-phase flow in various geometries.                 
              Transparent plexiglass test sections of spherically convex,                    
              rectangular and convergent-divergent channels will be                          
              considered.  The pressure drop fluctuations at the wall will                   
              be also measured.  The power spectrum for the fluctuating                      
              interfacial area concentration will be determined.  An attempt                 
              will be made to interpret the pressure and flow visualization                  
              measurements with a statistical model.                                         
                                                                                             
              This experimental study will provide new data on gas-liquid                    
              two-phase flow phenomena in channels, which may be used for                    
              modeling and instrumentation development.
