Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator intends to combine probabilistic               
              and analytic methods, related to the theory of partial                         
              differential equations, to study several stochastic control                    
              problems, which arise from portfolio management models with /or                
              without transaction fees.  These include investment-consumption                
              models, trading and forecasting models, recursive utility                      
              function models et cetera.  Such problems have already attracted               
              considerable attention by both financial economists and                        
              mathematicians.  The principal investigator plans to spend                     
              extensive periods of time visiting several institutions to                     
              interact with economists and mathematicians.  She also plans to                
              attend several meetings related to her work.
