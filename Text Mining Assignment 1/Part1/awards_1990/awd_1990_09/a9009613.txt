Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The proposed study will investigate how dopamine, an                      
              important neurotransmitter in the brain, is involved in the                    
              regulation of motivated behavior.  The proposed studies will                   
              investigate which brain areas are involved in this behavior, and               
              will study the effects of different drugs in this paradigm.                    
              These results will increase our knowledge of how dopamine is                   
              involved in motor processes that are related to motivation.
