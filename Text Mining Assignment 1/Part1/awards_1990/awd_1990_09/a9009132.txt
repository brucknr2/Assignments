Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                        ABSTRACT                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This proposal is concerned with the accuracy of children's                     
              memory of autobiographical events.  Current research on memory                 
              suggests that repeated questioning about a past event can                      
              enhance the consistency with which one recalls the event.  The                 
              PI intends to test various explanations of this finding with                   
              children, to determine the factors that influence the accuracy                 
              (or inaccuracy) of children's autobiographical memory.  The                    
              research has important implications not only for theories of                   
              memory, but for more practical concerns, as well.  For example,                
              it may shed light on issues of the reliability of children's                   
              courtroom testimony under repeated questioning, etc.  This                     
              research has the potential to expand our understanding of the                  
              factors that affect our memories of important life events.
