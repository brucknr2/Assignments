Abstract    :
                 This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Johansen to                 
              initiate independent studies aimed toward elucidating the                      
              mechanism of determination of correct cell fate choice and                     
              subsequent cellular differentiation during development in                      
              Drosophila.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that this award will help Dr. Johansen obtain                
              the preliminary results necessary to launch an independent                     
              research career.
