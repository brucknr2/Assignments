Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for the purchase of equipment of critical                  
              importance for the pursuit of experiments in the area of low                   
              temperature physics at the University of Massachusetts.  The                   
              equipment will permit interesting and timely experiments in the                
              areas of:  films of 3He/4He mixtures; localization; and the                    
              behavior of helium in restricted/disordered environments.
