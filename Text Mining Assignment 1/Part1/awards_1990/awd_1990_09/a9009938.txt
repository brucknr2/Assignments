Abstract    :
                   In this ROW/CAA (Research Opportunities for Women/ Career                 
              Advancement Award) project, Dr. Linda Strausbaugh at the                       
              University of Connecticut proposes to study the evolution of the               
              histone gene family in the Drosophila willistoni species complex.              
              The histones are a class of proteins universal in living                       
              organisms which, because of their functional importance in                     
              chromosomes, have been highly conserved by evolution. Strausbaugh              
              has found evidence of histone gene variation among closely                     
              related species of the D. willistoni complex and proposes a                    
              series of experiments to test theories about the evolution of                  
              histone genes. Dr. Strausbaugh is a molecular geneticist                       
              attempting to carry her research into the realm of evolutionary                
              biology. Under the ROW/CAA program she will continue her work                  
              initiated while on sabbatical leave at Yale University during the              
              1989-90 academic year; specifically, she will "re-tool" her                    
              laboratory for studies in molecular evolution, initiate several                
              new projects and complete the projects initiated at Yale.
