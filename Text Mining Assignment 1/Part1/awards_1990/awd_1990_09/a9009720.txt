Abstract    :
                   The intent of this research is to develop explicit formal                 
              models for control of flexible manufacturing cells.  The models                
              will add considerably to the development of a science base for                 
              manufacturing, and towards addressing the generic issues in                    
              control of manufacturing systems.  A direct application of these               
              models would be in the development of automatic software                       
              generators for cell control.  This research presents a novel                   
              approach to control a flexible manufacturing cell, where the                   
              control actions are executed as a by product of grammar                        
              recognition.  Each controller will be modeled as a layered parser              
              capable of recognizing a "manufacturing language", with the                    
              control actions embedded as semantic actions within each control               
              grammar.  Specific activities include:  development of formal                  
              models of the physical and logical views of the manufacturing                  
              cell, establishing equivalence of properties of the FMS cell to                
              context free grammars, defining the various semantic actions, and              
              developing the control grammars for various controllers in the                 
              system.
