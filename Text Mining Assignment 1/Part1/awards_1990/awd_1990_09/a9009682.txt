Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigator will examine the rearrangement of synapses                    
              ("synapse elimination") occurring in neonatal rat muscle.  The                 
              long-term goal is to understand the qualitative and quantitative               
              roles of this rearrangement in generating the adult innervation.               
              The project has two specific aims.  1) To ascertain how single                 
              motor neurons distribute their synapses to the types of fibers                 
              present at the time of birth.  Intracellular dye injection will                
              be used to mark fibers innervated by a single motor neuron; the                
              types of these fibers will be determined using antibodies                      
              directed against myosin heavy chain isoforms.  These results will              
              reveal whether synaptic rearrangement generates the selective                  
              innervation of fiber types found to exist a week following birth               
              or whether these connections are already selective at birth.  An               
              examination of the innervation of fiber types during the early                 
              stages of reinnervation of neonatal muscle is also proposed in                 
              order to determine whether the final selective pattern seen in                 
              these muscles is the result of synaptic rearrangement.  2) To                  
              determine whether slow and fast motor neurons innervate the same               
              fibers during embryonic developments.  The fast fibers which are               
              present in the neonatal soleus muscles are not generated until                 
              after the 20th day of gestation.  Thus at this time, fast motor                
              neurons must either be innervating slow fibers or alternatively                
              awaiting the generation of fast fibers before they begin                       
              synaptogenesis.  These alternatives will be distinguished by                   
              determining the number of motor neurons innervating soleus on the              
              20th day of gestation.
