Abstract    :
              The proposed work is to design and initiate a research program to              
              investigate the detailed sedimentology and hydrodynamics of tidal              
              creeks along the Georgia coast.  The approach will be a                        
              quantitative analysis of low processes and sedimentation, which is             
              especially important because few existing facies models accurately             
              explain fluvial to marine transitional deposits in terms of modern             
              processes.  A research program will be developed in modern coastal             
              environments that will lead to better three-dimensional models                 
              useful for interpreting the ancient sedimentary record.                        
              Specifically this research will lead to better understanding of the            
              mechanisms that control evolution of tidal creek-salt marsh                    
              ecosystems and how they are preserved in the geologic record.
