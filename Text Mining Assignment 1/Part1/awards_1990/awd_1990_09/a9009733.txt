Abstract    :
              This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant                  
              is in the general area of organic chemistry.  Dr. Banita White                 
              Brown of the Chemistry Department of the University of North                   
              Carolina at Charlotte will attempt to prepare several one-armed                
              and two-armed peptide-derived lariat esters.  Circular                         
              dichroism (CD) measurements will be made on at least two                       
              systems in order to test the feasibility of CD in determining                  
              binding constants for sodium, potassium, and calcium cations.                  
              The lariat esters are expected to behave as ionophores and                     
              exhibit selectivity for particular cations.  If promising                      
              results are obtained, a proposal for sustained study in this                   
              area may be developed, perhaps focussing on competition between                
              sidearm and ring sites for complexation or the roles of                        
              conformation and donor group polarity in cation selectivity.
