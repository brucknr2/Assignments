Abstract    :
              Semiconductor processing techniques will be utilized                           
              to fabricate electron optical structures.  In addition to                      
              electron microscopy the results of this research can                           
              also be applied to high definition cathode ray tubes                           
              (HDCRT), 10um period wigglers, and vacuum                                      
              microelectronics.  The areas considered in this                                
              proposal are:                                                                  
                .   A specimen holder with a binary selection of                             
                    square apertures in a diaphragm ranging from                             
                    1um to 32um on a side, to support ultrathin                              
                    specimens.                                                               
                .   Miniature thermionic electron sources that                               
                    have a flat emitting surface of varying size.                            
                    There will be up to 10,000 of these filaments                            
                    on each substrate.  In addition a pseudo-                                
                    blackbody source of electrons will be                                    
                    fabricated, this will have the advantage of a                            
                    reduced evaporation of work function                                     
                    lowering impurities for tungsten.                                        
                 .  Programmable thermionic electron sources                                 
                    that can control the emitting surface by                                 
                    changing the current path.  This feature will                            
                    add flexibility to the traditional triode design                         
                    that relies on a Wehnelt electrode to control                            
                    the emitting area.                                                       
              Electron specimen holders, and sources have been                               
              traditionally made with a beaker or in a machine                               
              shop.  Semiconductor processing techniques                                     
              developed for integrated circuit manufacture can                               
              generate 1-100um patterns in two and three                                     
              dimensions with appropriate etching.  This                                     
              unprecedented control can be used to greatly improve                           
              the ease of manufacture of electron optical                                    
              components and the resolution in microscopy.
