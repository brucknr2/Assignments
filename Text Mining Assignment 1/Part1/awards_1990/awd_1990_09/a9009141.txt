Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Render's                  
              sabbatical visit to the laboratory of Dr. Chris Doe at the                     
              University of Illinois.  Dr. Render intends to learn modern                    
              molecular biology techniques, in order to apply them to her                    
              experimental system involving cell fate specification during                   
              development of a gastropod mollusc.                                            
                                                                                             
              The acquisition of these new techniques, and the opportunity to                
              apply them to the experimental system which has already been                   
              fruitful, is anticipated to significantly enhance her career.
