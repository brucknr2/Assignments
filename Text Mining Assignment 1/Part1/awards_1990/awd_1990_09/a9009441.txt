Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a post-event investigation project to learn                            
              engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                   
              1989).                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project is to collect, analyze, and interpret the                         
              technical and hazard mitigation data related to the                            
              performance of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings in                         
              response to the Loma Prieta Earthquake.                                        
                                                                                             
              The collected performance data will be applied to the                          
              improvement of the "SEAOC/CALBO Joint Unreinforced Masonry                     
              Technical Strengthening Provisions."  These provisions have                    
              been recently approved by the Structural Engineers Association                 
              of California (SEAOC) as a submittal for inclusion in the                      
              Uniform Code of Building Conservation (UCBC).  If approved by                  
              the International Council of Building Officials they will                      
              provide unified design criteria for the hazard mitigation of                   
              URM buildings                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This data base can provide valuable improvements to these new                  
              provisions in the form of additions, clarifications, and                       
              changes necessary for their effective implementation.  These                   
              improvements will be formulated to provide the related                         
              supplementary commentary and example applications.                             
                                                                                             
              This project will make an important contribution to the                        
              improvement of seismic code provisions.
