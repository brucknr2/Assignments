Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The object of this proposed research is to undertake exploratory               
              studies on the ultraviolet transmittance characteristics of                    
              fluoride glasses.  In particular the effect of composition on the              
              ultraviolet absorption edge will be investigated in a range of                 
              fluoride compositions.  Furthermore, the effect of ultraviolet                 
              irradiation on the absorption edge will also be studied.  The                  
              proposed research is intended, in part, to assess the viability of             
              further work in the area of optical characteristics of ultraviolet             
              transmitting glasses.
