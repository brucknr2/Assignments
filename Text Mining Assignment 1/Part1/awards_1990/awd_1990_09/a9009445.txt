Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the research of a cultural anthropologist in               
              Los Angeles, California.  The project studies the history and                  
              present state of community activism about housing in a multi-                  
              ethnic, blue-collar Black, Latino, and White neighborhood.  Using              
              the methods of ethnography and oral history the project will                   
              study how women have been key forces in maintaining their                      
              community's informal infrastructure, shaping its cohesive values               
              and transforming daily networks and values into local activism                 
              and grassroots political culture.                                              
                                                                                             
              This research is important because grassroots political movements              
              are one of the bedrocks of democracy.  Understanding how they are              
              formed around issues of varying importance to different ethnic                 
              groups, and analyzing the role of women in maintaining local                   
              political culture will provide information useful to municipality              
              governments and urban housing planners.
