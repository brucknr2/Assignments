Abstract    :
              Due to its potential for high reliability and high performance, a              
              carefully designed distributed system can make an ideal controller for         
              real-time applications.  However, the main drawback of a distributed           
              system is that the communication latency between tasks executing on two        
              different nodes can be fairly large.  This research is to improve the          
              communication performance by addressing the problems related to message        
              passing in a distributed system with point-to-point interconnection            
              topology.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              First, the assignment of deadlines to messages based on the deadlines          
              of related tasks is formalized.  Message passing techniques are then           
              developed that have higher probabilities of messages meeting their             
              assigned deadlines.  Since, by the first objective, the deadlines have         
              been assigned in a proper manner, the new message passing techniques           
              result in a better communication mechanism between the real-time tasks.        
                                                                                             
              Our approach is to first characterize the probability distribution             
              function of message delivery times.  Using this distribution, the              
              deadlines for messages from the deadlines of related tasks will then be        
              derived.  Finally, use will be made of the multiple disjoint paths in          
              a distributed system to increase the probability of a message meeting          
              its assigned deadline.
