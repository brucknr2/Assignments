Abstract    :
              Pyruvate and phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP) are two central                        
              intermediates in cellular metabolism.  They are the branch                     
              points of many catabolic and biosynthetic pathways.                            
              Although the importance of these intermediates has long                        
              been recognized, the use of both genetic and engineering                       
              techniques for studying the physiological effect of                            
              redirected pyruvate and PEP metabolism has not been                            
              reported.  Pyruvate is not normally recycled back to PEP                       
              under glycolytic conditions.  Because of this                                  
              irreversibility, the yields of many specialty chemicals                        
              produced from glucose via bacterial fermentations remain                       
              low.  The Principal Investigator proposes to construct and                     
              characterize strains of the bacteria E. coli which can                         
              recycle pyruvate back to PEP.  In addition to improving the                    
              yields of amino acid fermentations, the results of this                        
              project could contribute to the understanding of how the                       
              cell distributes its carbon source, and how to decouple                        
              product formation from cell growth.
