Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Calcium entry leads to the release of neurotransmitters in nerve               
              terminals.  Malfunctions in this fundamental process can result                
              in neurological and neuromuscular diseases.  Despite vigorous                  
              research, the actual mechanism whereby calcium entry regulates                 
              transmitter release is poorly understood.  This conference will                
              focus on nerve terminals; concentrating on the biophysical and                 
              pharmacological properties of nerve terminal calcium channels,                 
              the entry and distribution of calcium ions after the nerve                     
              impulse, the physiology of calcium-dependent transmitter release,              
              and the mechanism by which calcium triggers secretory vesicle                  
              fusion.  In addition, new experimental techniques will be                      
              highlighted.  The conference will assemble some of the best                    
              investigators working in the area to discuss the current status                
              of knowledge and to examine the most promising lines of future                 
              development.
