Abstract    :
                   The development of beams of fast bare ions in the last two                
              decades has allowed atomic physicists to vary the coupling                     
              constant in non-trivial, ion-atom reactions and much has been                  
              learned.  In real atoms the electrons provide a wide range of                  
              velocity scales.  Thus, it becomes important to develop the                    
              theoretical and computational tools to describe excitation,                    
              ionization and charge transfer over broad energy regimes.  The                 
              present work is based on a variational expansion of the                        
              scattering wavefunction in a truncated Hilbert space.  The                     
              method goes beyond the independent particle model to describe                  
              an ion perturbing a fully correlated, two electron atom and                    
              given an interpretation of two electron pseudostates, allows a                 
              complete description of such systems.  The eventual goal is to                 
              explore reacting, relativistic many-body systems.
