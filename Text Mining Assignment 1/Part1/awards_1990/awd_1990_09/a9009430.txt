Abstract    :
              The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will establish a                      
              world class calibration facility for CTDs and other                            
              hydrographic instruments that are necessary for modern ocean                   
              science research.  Permanent equipment and supplies will be                    
              acquired and technical support will be provided to set up the                  
              facility and make it operational.  The facility will be                        
              housed in a new addition to an existing building being                         
              constructed by the institution.  Major components of the                       
              calibration facility have been provided by the Office of                       
              Naval Technology.  NSF funded research projects such as WOCE                   
              will be the prime beneficiaries of the facility.
