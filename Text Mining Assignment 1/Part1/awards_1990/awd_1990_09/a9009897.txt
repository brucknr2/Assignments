Abstract    :
              Conventional database systems process all the data (related to a               
              query) before providing a response. This project develops new                  
              query processing methods suitable for the database management                  
              systems (DBMS) when they are to respond to estimation, error-                  
              constrained and time-constrained queries, or when there is no                  
              need or there is not enough time to process all the data related               
              to the query. This approach incorporates sampling and sample                   
              size determination mechanisms into DBMS so that, with a given                  
              user's requirement (e.g., timing or error constraints), the DBMS               
              can determine an appropriate amount of sample tuples that need to              
              be processed in order to produce acceptable estimations for                    
              aggregate relational queries.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to provide efficient methods for                  
              DBMS that will be able to effectively support time- and error-                 
              constrained environments, and serve for other statistical                      
              purposes. Furthermore, these facilities will also provide                      
              ordinary users with convenient working environments enabling the               
              users to get statistical information about the database as soon                
              (or as precise) as they wish by specifying the timing                          
              constraints, sampling fractions or error constraints. Such                     
              statistically enhanced DBMSs will find a wide variety of                       
              applications.
