Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award will permit Dr. Healey to study                 
              the physics of color image formation and the use of physical                   
              models in segmenting and analyzing color imagery.  Highlight                   
              grouping and clustering of normalized colors will be used in new               
              algorithms for color edge detection, segmentation, and material                
              identification.  Image sensors will also be modeled, and high-                 
              speed implementations will be studied.  This work may be                       
              particularly important in industrial inspection tasks, where                   
              color information can compensate for uncalibrated illumination                 
              changes and poor or varying sensor optics.
