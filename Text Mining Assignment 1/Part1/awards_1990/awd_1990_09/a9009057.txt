Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with two problems in commutative               
              algebra. The principal investigator will analyze the direct-sum                
              decompositions of Cohen-Macaulay modules. She will also study the              
              structure of the partially ordered set of prime ideals in a                    
              noetherian ring and the influence of this poset on the direct-sum              
              behavior of modules over the ring.                                             
                   Commutative rings are algebraic structures possessing a                   
              commutative addition and a commutative multiplication. These                   
              structures occur throughout mathematics and algebra. Common                    
              examples include polynomial rings and rings of algebraic integers              
              in extension fields of the rationals. This project is concerned                
              with several questions concerning commutative rings.
