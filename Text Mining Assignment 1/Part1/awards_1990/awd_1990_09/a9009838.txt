Abstract    :
              Heterologous proteins produced by recombinant DNA                              
              technology are frequently isolated in unfolded and inactive                    
              forms.  These proteins must be refolded before a useful                        
              product is obtained.  In this proposal, a novel                                
              quasi-electric light scattering (QELS) technique is                            
              proposed for use in studying protein refolding and                             
              aggregation.  Processing conditions that facilitate protein                    
              refolding and environmental effects on the functional                          
              properties of the folded proteins will be evaluated using                      
              beta-galactosidase as a model protein.
