Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Neuropeptide Y is a 36 amino acid peptide that has been                        
              implicated in the integration of a variety of behavioral,                      
              endocrine, and autonomic functions, including several aspects of               
              reproduction.  It has been demonstrated that the gonadal                       
              hormones, estradiol and progesterone can alter the hypothalamic                
              mRNA levels of neuropeptide Y.  This project will examine the DNA              
              sequence which is responsible for the hormonal regulation of the               
              gene that codes for Neuropeptide Y. Dr. Camp will establish                    
              standard molecular biological methods to study the mechanisms by               
              which steroids affect gene expression in the central nervous                   
              system.  A promotor region of Neuropeptide Y gene will be used to              
              test the gene's responsiveness to progesterone.  The result of                 
              this research will serve as a model for exploring the methods by               
              which hormones regulate the synthesis of neurotransmitters in the              
              central nervous system.//
