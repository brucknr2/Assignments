Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The research is designed to illuminate the psycholinguistic                    
              processes involved in implementing long-distance dependencies                  
              during language production.  Such dependencies constitute a                    
              considerable theoretical challenge, since the abstract structural              
              knowledge required to reliably format the discontinuous elements               
              does not straightforwardly mesh with articulatory requirement of               
              incremental, word-by-word production.  The dependencies to be                  
              explored are, primarily, number agreement between subjects and                 
              verbs, and, secondarily, number agreement between subjects and                 
              subject anaphors.  Because verb agreement in English may call on               
              a range of information about number from the nonlinguistic                     
              message, from the lexicon, from the morphology, and from other                 
              sources, it offers many opportunities to examine the transmission              
              and interaction of information during language production.                     
              Conversely, because it exhibits strict syntactic conditioning, it              
              offers opportunities to observe constraints on the transmission                
              and interaction of information.  Predictions about the nature of               
              information transmission and the types of constraints likely to                
              operate are derived from an approach to production developed by                
              Garrett (1975, 1988) and elaborated by others (Bock, 1987a;                    
              Lapointe, 1985; Lapointe & Dell, 1989; Levelt, 1989).  The                     
              experiments employ agreement-error elicitation tasks in tandem                 
              with timed pronunciation tasks to explore the nature of the                    
              number information used in the agreement operation, the nature of              
              subject identification and maintenance operations, and the                     
              processing demands of agreement implementation.
