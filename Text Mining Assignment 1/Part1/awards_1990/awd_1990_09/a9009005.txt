Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is in the area of control of structural                          
              vibrations.  Flexible mechanical systems are widely used in                    
              spacecraft, buildings and bridges, material processing                         
              devices, and elsewhere.  Vibration of such systems limits                      
              their utility in many applications.  This project addresses                    
              this topic and focuses on the modeling, analysis, and                          
              experimental evaluation of noncolocated vibration control                      
              of flexible mechanical systems.  It utilizes the time delay                    
              approach to eliminate structural instabilities.  The                           
              research comprises four phases, including (1) formulation                      
              of a noncolocated control system in the frequency domain,                      
              (2) development of the time delay approach for noncolocated                    
              control, (3) analysis of the noncolocated control system                       
              and design of stabilizing controllers, and (4) experimental                    
              verification of the control system model and time delay                        
              approach.  This is a multidisciplinary problem requiring                       
              expertise in dynamics, structural analysis, and control                        
              system design.
