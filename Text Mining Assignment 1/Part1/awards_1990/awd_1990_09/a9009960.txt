Abstract    :
              Computer architectures dominated by control logic are an important class       
              since many applications specific designs are dominated by design of the        
              control logic.  This research is developing new optimization algorithms        
              for behavioral synthesis of control dominated  machines. Research is           
              being done on: a. how to partition the behavioral synthesis process into       
              manageable compilation steps, b. finding optimization algorithms to            
              implement the compilation steps, c. determining how various                    
              optimizations interact, and d. developing reliable methods to estimate         
              hardware costs to drive optimization.  An experimental behavioral              
              synthesis compiler is being built and will be used to experiment with          
              real examples to test the optimization algorithms.
