Abstract    :
              A pattern modeling techniques for representing,                                
              analyzing, and classifying features in data sets                               
              resulting from fluid dynamics and combustion                                   
              diagnostics research, with particular emphasis on                              
              turbulent flows will be developed.  The primary                                
              thrust of the research is directed toward a two                                
              component model for flow fields; one being                                     
              oriented along the major direction of anisotropy,                              
              describing the large scale flow; the other being a                             
              residual pattern representing the independent small                            
              scale flow structures.  The separation into global                             
              and localized flows facilitates subsequent                                     
              identification and tracking of features such as                                
              eddies.  Significant data compression will be                                  
              achievable due to the decorrelation of the flow                                
              patterns.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Low level image processing techniques will be                                  
              developed to meet the challenges posed by the                                  
              unconventional properties of fluid imagery.  A                                 
              method for low level image segmentation based on                               
              a topographic classifier will be investigated.  In                             
              addition, orthogonal transforms for further                                    
              compression of the two component flow model will                               
              be researched.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Data acquired from established laboratories will be                            
              used to test our modeling strategy.  Spatially and                             
              temporally resolved 2D data sets will be used to                               
              extend our previous work in feature detection and                              
              tracking experiments.  We expect the proposed                                  
              work will meet some of the needs voiced by the                                 
              combustion and heat transfer community                                         
              concerning the automation of computer analysis                                 
              techniques for large fluid flow data sets.
