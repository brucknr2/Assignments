Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential                    
              equations (ODEs and PDEs) provides an important class of large                 
              scale scientific computing problems.  Fourier analysis has been                
              used by applied mathematicians as a simple and effective tool to               
              analyze the numerical properties of approximation schemes and                  
              solution methods for ODEs and PDEs.  This includes three main                  
              objectives: (1) exploiting Fourier tools used in the areas of                  
              digital filtering and digital control for solving ODEs and                     
              elliptic PDEs, (2) analyzing numerical ODE and elliptic PDE                    
              algorithms with Fourier techniques so that they can be understood              
              by electrical engineers in a more familiar setting, and (3)                    
              development of new parallel algorithms and study of their                      
              performnce on parallel algorithms and study of their performance               
              on parallel computers such as the Connection Machine CM/2 and                  
              Alliant FX/80.
