Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to provide Dr. Postle with               
              some release time from teaching, plus supplies and necessary                   
              equipment, so that she can try out some rather high risk                       
              experiments to investigate physical interactions between TonB (a               
              protein of the E. coli membrane which is involved in transport                 
              of vitamin B12 and iron-bearing siderophores) and other E. coli                
              envelope proteins.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This award will give her the opportunity to try out these risky                
              experiments without compromising her ongoing research program on               
              various aspects of TonB.  If the experiments work, the results                 
              would serve to significantly enhance her visibility and stature                
              in the field, thereby enhancing her career.
