Abstract    :
              Physical controls for most devices are either "one size fits all"              
              or require custom hardware for each user.  Cost often prohibits                
              custom design, and each user must adapt to the standard device                 
              interface, typically with a loss of precision and efficiency.                  
              When user abilities vary widely, such as in the disabled                       
              community, devices often become unusable.  The goal is to create               
              a system that will track user gestures and interpret them as                   
              control signals for devices.  Existing gesture recognition                     
              research converts continuous body motion into discrete signals.                
              The approach is to map continuous motions into a set of analog                 
              device control signals.  The system will allow us to quickly                   
              tailor a device interface to each user's best physical range of                
              motion.  The first application domain is a speech synthesizer for              
              disabled users.  Results are expected in two major areas of                    
              applicability for non-disabled users:  in telemanipulator                      
              interfaces, and as a design tool for creating biomechanically                  
              efficient interfaces.
