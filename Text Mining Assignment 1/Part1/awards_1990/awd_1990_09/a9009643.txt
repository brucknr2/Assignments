Abstract    :
              Multiprocessor architectures are being widely investigated to overcome         
              the performance limitations of traditional uniprocessor computer               
              systems.  VLSI and Wafer Scale Integration (WSI) of the entire                 
              multiprocessor architecture on a single wafer further enhance the system       
              performance by eliminating long off-chip signal delay and                      
              interconnection.  However, an efficient fault tolerance scheme is              
              essential for the VLSI/WSI implementation to achieve a practical level         
              of yield and reliability.  This research is developing practical design        
              methodologies capable of efficiently realizing large fault tolerant            
              multiprocessor architectures of regular interconnection structure on a         
              single large area VLSI circuit. The study is based on nonprobabilistic         
              model to produce practical results which can be used in actual                 
              implementation.  We are also developing efficient wafer testing and            
              diagnosis schemes.
