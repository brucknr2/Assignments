Abstract    :
                   The genus Lacuna is an herbivorous gastropod that uses its                
              radula (a ribbon-like structure covered with variably-shaped                   
              "teeth") to scrape algae.  This genus displays an unusual level                
              of morphological variability in radular teeth, and Dr. Dianna                  
              Padilla proposes an exploratory research project aimed at                      
              establishing the causes of this variability.  During a year of                 
              research planning, Dr. Padilla will use enzyme electrophoresis to              
              establish species identities and evolutionary relationships.                   
              Controlled growth experiments using different food types will                  
              reveal the degree to which radular morphology varies within a                  
              brood, and the degree to which the physical nature of food items               
              produces different radular variations.                                         
                   The proposed research will find a wide audience among                     
              developmental and evolutionary biologists, systematists, and                   
              ecologists.  The various possible sources of morphological                     
              variation are factors in diverse research areas, but only a few                
              studies such as Dr. Padilla's actually assess their relative                   
              contributions.
