Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A field program will examine the mutual interaction of the Deep                
              Western Boundary Current and the Gulf Stream as they cross near                
              Cape Hatteras.  Sampling will include both hydrography with a                  
              CTD and direct measures of transport with POGOs.  An additional                
              tracer, CFM, will be measured through a companion proposal from                
              Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory.  Dynamical                              
              interpretations of the data will follow.
