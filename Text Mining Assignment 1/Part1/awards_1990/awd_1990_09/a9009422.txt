Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this exploratory research is to                                    
              develop a method to control the degradation                                    
              properties of implanted materials. The                                         
              approach is to deposit negative charges on                                     
              the implant material using low-temperature                                     
              gas plasma technology. The negative surface                                    
              charges are expected to repel the negative OH                                  
              ions involved in hydrolytic degradation                                        
              mechanisms. The work will test the hypothesis                                  
              that the degradation rate of surface-treated                                   
              synthetic absorbable polymers will be reduced                                  
              when compared with those of untreated                                          
              materials. The degradation rate will be                                        
              determined using several quantitative                                          
              techniques. If successful, this research will                                  
              open up a new way of designing implant                                         
              materials for specific degradation rates.                                      
              Moreover, the possibility also exists that                                     
              the degradation rate may be controllable                                       
              externally.
