Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Climate fluctuations may pose a considerable                                   
              risk to municipal water supply and                                             
              distribution systems (WSD) in areas with high                                  
              rates of water demand.  The project will                                       
              examine the risks to such systems associated                                   
              with two types of drought-induced failure                                      
              modes: a) aggregate demand exceeding aggregate                                 
              supply; and b) demand rate exceeding system                                    
              capacity.  Three classes of WSD systems will                                   
              be studied:  systems constrained by                                            
              availability of supplies only; systems                                         
              constrained by treatment and distribution                                      
              capacity only; and systems constrained by both                                 
              capacity and supplies.  Techniques will be                                     
              developed for numerically estimating the risks                                 
              to WSD systems under recurring drought                                         
              conditions.  Results will provide water                                        
              conservation strategies to decrease the impact                                 
              of drought on urban communities.
