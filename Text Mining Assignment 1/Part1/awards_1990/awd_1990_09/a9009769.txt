Abstract    :
                   This work will study the eigenvectors of a schematic shell                
              model whose classical limit displays both regular and chaotic                  
              motion.  The statistics of matrix elements will be examined for                
              universal features expected from random matrix theory and for                  
              specific features corresponding to short periodic orbits.
