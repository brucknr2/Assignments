Abstract    :
              Substitutional dopants in silicon diffuse via                                  
              interactions with point defects (interstitials and                             
              vacancies).  Simulators which model the fabrication of                         
              two dimensional integrated circuit structures and                              
              explicitly consider point defects have recently been                           
              developed (i.e., SUPREM IV), but in order for them                             
              to accurately predict device structures, a great deal of                       
              work remains in developing and quantifying models.                             
              The goal of this work is to develop basic quantitative                         
              physical models of substitutional dopant diffusion and                         
              precipitation/clustering for such simulators which can                         
              consistently predict the redistribution of dopants over                        
              the full range of fabrication conditions: in lightly and                       
              heavily doped materials, enhanced and retarded                                 
              diffusion under conditions of point defect injection                           
              and extraction.  We will analyze existing experimental                         
              observations of dopant diffusion under equilibrium                             
              and non-equilibrium conditions and also conduct new                            
              experiments to produce models which can be                                     
              incorporated into future fabrication simulators.
