Abstract    :
                   This is a project to test a new model of how competition for              
              food and risk of predation interact to affect primate group size               
              and structure.  Most models that predict primate group size treat              
              predation risk and within-group food competition as distinct                   
              factors which can be measured independently from each other.                   
              In contrast, Janson proposes a mathematical model in which, for a              
              given habitat, both an individual monkey's food intake and                     
              predation risk are functions of four socioecological parameters:               
              group size, spacing between individuals, time spent vigilant, and              
              time spent foraging.  Because parameter values which decrease                  
              risk of predation also decrease food intake, the optimal social                
              group size in this model is remarkably independent of the                      
              intensity of predation, while the other socioecological                        
              parameters covary with group size in well-defined ways.  Data on               
              brown capuchin monkey social structure will be collected on four               
              groups in a low-predation environment in a National Park in                    
              Argentina, and compared with data previously collected by the PI               
              on the same species in a high-predation environment in Peru.  The              
              proposed study will be the first in which differences in both                  
              food availability and predation risk between populations are                   
              measured and related to specific differences in social structure.
