Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The surface segregation of one species from a binary polymer                   
              blend                                                                          
              has important consequences in determining the strength of                      
              polymer-                                                                       
              substrate composites.  In this it is proposed to study the                     
              surface                                                                        
              behavior of a binary blend, in which all segments of one chain                 
              interact identically with the surface, while the end moieties                  
              of                                                                             
              the second species, which has the same repeat units as the                     
              first                                                                          
              chain, have energetic interactions with the surface that are                   
              different from the central beads.  Preliminary analytical                      
              calculations on this subject suggest that the difference in                    
              energetic interactions between chain ends and middle beads of                  
              the                                                                            
              second species with the surface will dictate which component                   
              will                                                                           
              partition to it.  It follows that one can maximize the surface                 
              segregation of an appropriate species from the blend by                        
              controlling                                                                    
              the chemistry of the end moieties, thus allowing for the                       
              design of                                                                      
              polymer composite with desired mechanical properties.                          
              Experimentally, these theoretical predictions will be verified                 
              by                                                                             
              a new technique, neutron reflectivity.  From a theoretical                     
              viewpoint, analytical lattice models are being developed to                    
              examine                                                                        
              these situations.
