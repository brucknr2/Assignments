Abstract    :
                    A new three terminal device, double                                      
              heterostructure optoelectronic thyristor                                       
              (DHOET), will be investigated for picosecond                                   
              high power switching and for generating short                                  
              laser pulse with high output power.  The                                       
              device is developed from concepts of Si                                        
              thyristors and double heterostructure (DH)                                     
              lasers and will be based on GaInAsP/InP                                        
              heterostructures grown by liquid phase                                         
              epitaxy.  While numerous research works have                                   
              been reported about Si based thyristors, little                                
              has been done as A1GaAs/GaAs and no                                            
              work has been reported on GaInAsP/InP                                          
              based thyristors.  The main thrust of this                                     
              proposed study is to understand the effects of                                 
              band discontinuities ( Ec, Ev) on the turn-on                                  
              and turn-off speed of the proposed DHOETs                                      
              and to explore their unique features as                                        
              compared to Si thyristors including: (i) much                                  
              higher device speed, (ii) higher device                                        
              operating temperature, (iii) higher radiation                                  
              resistance, and (iv) excellent optical triggering                              
              sensitivity with InP as the optical window.                                    
                    This research may open up a                                              
              practically important new research area of III-                                
              V-DHOETs for the applications of high speed                                    
              pulsed power switching and the generation of                                   
              subnanosecond electrical and optical high                                      
              power pulses.  Research performed in this                                      
              project is expected to advance our                                             
              understanding of heterostructures and will                                     
              have many other important applications such                                    
              as the potential of fabricating novel optical                                  
              amplifiers.
