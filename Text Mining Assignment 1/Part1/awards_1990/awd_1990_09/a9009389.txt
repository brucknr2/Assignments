Abstract    :
              The long range objective of this program is to develop cell                    
              culture procedures that can be readily applied to improve                      
              the efficiency of producing monoclonal antibodies.  The                        
              proposal focuses on using engineering approaches to                            
              describe cells at the metabolic level so that methods in                       
              which hybridoma cells utilize energy to proliferate and                        
              produce monoclonal antibodies can be better understood and                     
              more effectively controlled.  It is proposed to integrate                      
              expertise from three technological loci: biosensing, cell                      
              culturing, and mathematical modeling, and to integrate                         
              these in order to improve processing procedures.
