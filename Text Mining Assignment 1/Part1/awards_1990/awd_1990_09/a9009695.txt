Abstract    :
                   This planning grant seeks support for examination of Upper                
              Triassic and Lower Jurassic rocks from Baja California to                      
              document the location of the Triassic/Jurassic boundary,                       
              illuminate issues of terrane provenance, and calibrate zonations               
              with those of other fossil groups.  Research will provide PI with              
              first independent NSF support and allow her to resume a research               
              career interrupted by several years with industry and other                    
              activities.  Proposed work will increase her competitiveness with              
              subsequent proposals.
