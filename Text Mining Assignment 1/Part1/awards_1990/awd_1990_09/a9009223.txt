Abstract    :
              The onset of scuffing wear will be studied in a device which                   
              will allow simulation of the contact conditions of pressure,                   
              temperature and contact stress which exist in the                              
              elastohydrodynamic conjectures of gears, cams and similar                      
              components.  The results will be related to molecular                          
              adsorption/desorption of the lubricant on the wearing surfaces.
