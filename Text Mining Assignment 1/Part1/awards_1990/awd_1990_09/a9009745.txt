Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is a "Research Opportunity for Women / Research                  
              Planning Grant" pilot project by a young cultural anthropologist               
              who will study maritime share contracts among fishermen in the                 
              Philippines.  Two coastal villages will be selected and twenty to              
              thirty fishermen will be interviewed in this two month project                 
              about their practice in dividing up their product in shares.                   
              Theories of share contracts developed for agricultural production              
              will be evaluated for their relevance to fishing.                              
                                                                                             
              This project is important because it supports the scientific                   
              research of a young woman investigator, and helps her develop her              
              potential for doing large-scale scientific research.  The topic                
              of share contracts is an important one because many economic                   
              production regimes are organized in shares, and the economic                   
              understanding of the history and development of share contracts                
              in specific environments will add to our general, comparative                  
              knowledge of this economic structure.
