Abstract    :
                   This research initiation award provides support to study the              
              dynamic control strategy for direct drive actuators used in                    
              precision machining systems.  To realize the full potential of                 
              direct actuation, advanced dynamic control techniques will be                  
              investigated to address problems of dynamic interaction between                
              drives and machining processes and dynamic coupling between axes.              
              Current linear motor technology may provide the response, speed and            
              force required for machining and could have great potential to                 
              realize higher speed and higher precision machining systems at a               
              cost advantage.  Since few applications of linear motors for                   
              machining exist, advanced control theory has seldom been applied               
              to this problem. This research investigates the control methods and            
              techniques for linear motors from the perspective of the entire                
              machining systems, as opposed to exclusively considering the                   
              actuator, independent of the machining process.
