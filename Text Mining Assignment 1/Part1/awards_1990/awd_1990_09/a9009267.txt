Abstract    :
              The proposed work expands research on expertise beyond traditional             
              descriptive or normative analyses by creatively using statistical              
              methods to define and measure informational and perceptual patterns            
              of experts.  Presently, methods to conduct such analyses of experts            
              do not exist.  The proposed studies extend previous laboratory work            
              to a complex field setting (medical decision making).  However, the            
              methods and results should be relevant for any domain that requires            
              the understanding and application of large amounts of specialized              
              knowledge.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The proposed research investigates the ability of expert physicians            
              to solve novel diagnostic problems.  Using a generative approach,              
              hypotheses are developed regarding the knowledge used by physicians            
              to perform a complex diagnosis task.  These hypotheses are tested              
              using descriptions of physicians' knowledge constructed from                   
              analyses of patient records.  Performance on these cases will be               
              examined for evidence of generativity including fluency, strategic             
              problem solving, and use of general heuristics.  The study extends             
              previous investigations of generativity to professional judgment               
              and explicitly examines the relationship between perceptual and                
              strategic aspects of problem solving.
