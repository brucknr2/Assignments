Abstract    :
              The project will develop estimators of limited dependent variable              
              models, also known as Tobit models, with fixed effects.                        
              Individually, fixed effects models and Tobit models are                        
              frequently used in empirical economics. A Tobit model with fixed-              
              effects is implied by a structural life cycle model of labor                   
              supply and many other models, and is of interest as a reduced                  
              form specification.                                                            
                                                                                             
              It is desirable to have asymptotic results for fixed effects                   
              estimators as the number of individuals increases (with the                    
              number of observations per individual fixed). No current                       
              estimators for Tobit models with fixed effects are asymptotically              
              normal, or even consistent, as the number of individuals gets                  
              large. The project will solve this problem and at the same time                
              relax some of the distributional assumptions.  The efficiency of               
              the estimators that are constructed will also be examined. The                 
              research will be supplemented with simulations.                                
                                                                                             
              Given the availability of important panel data sets in economics,              
              the development of these estimators will improve the estimation                
              of many important types of economic models, especially in the                  
              area of labor economics.
