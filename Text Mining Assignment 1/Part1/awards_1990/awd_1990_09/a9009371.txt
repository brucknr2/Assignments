Abstract    :
                 This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Hopp to                     
              initiate independent studies aimed at understanding the                        
              biochemical aspects of skeletal muscle aging.                                  
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that this award will help Dr. Hopp obtain the                
              preliminary results necessary to launch an independent research                
              career.
