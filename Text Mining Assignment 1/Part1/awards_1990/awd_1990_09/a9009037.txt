Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  We know several of the areas in the brain which control                   
              eye movement but we know little about where they are                           
              inter connected for the eyes to move in a coordinated and                      
              responsive fashion.  To study one such interconnection two sites               
              in the brain will be injected with two different neuroanatomical               
              tracers.  The experiment will test if the cortical frontal eye                 
              field is connected to the same cells as the cerebellar fastigial               
              nucleus projections.  Electron microscopy will be used to prove                
              if the identified axons terminate on the same neuron and if so                 
              what the synaptic relationships are.  The study should increase                
              our knowledge of how and where eye movement is controlled.
