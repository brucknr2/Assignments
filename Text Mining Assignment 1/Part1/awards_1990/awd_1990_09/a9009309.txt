Abstract    :
              Four major problems have dominated recent discussions of U.S.                  
              economic growth: the productivity slowdown that began in 1973,                 
              the dramatic differences in growth across regions throughout the               
              postwar era, the relationship between productivity and U.S.                    
              international competitiveness, and the impact of the                           
              deterioration of the public infrastructure on the nation's                     
              economic performance. The analysis of regional productivity                    
              growth  from this project could potentially offer important                    
              insights into all of these issues.                                             
                                                                                             
              In this project, the growth rate and level of productivity in                  
              twenty one industries for each of nine regions over the 1951-1986              
              period will be estimated. This approach parallels the trend in                 
              national productivity research toward disaggregation. Although                 
              this disaggregation has focused on narrower industry detail, it                
              is likely that focusing on regional growth will lead to further                
              gains. The results of the project will allow several important                 
              questions to be answered:                                                      
                   (1) Has productivity grown more rapidly in some regions than              
              others?                                                                        
                   (2) Was the productivity slowdown limited to a small number               
              of regions, or was it more pervasive?                                          
                   (3) Is there any evidence that regional productivity levels               
              are converging?                                                                
                   (4) Are regional differences in productivity correlated with              
              industrial characteristics, the degree of urbanization, education              
              expenditures, regional investment in public infrastructure                     
              capital, and other public policies?
