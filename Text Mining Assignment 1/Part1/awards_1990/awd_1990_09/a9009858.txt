Abstract    :
              The strength of paper will be studied as functions of                          
              microstructure and polymer-fiber adhesive interactions.                        
              Structure layering will be quantized and correlated with both                  
              wet and dry strength.  In addition, resin retention will be                    
              determined for a number of ionic conditions and strain rates.                  
              The experimental work will be supplemented with computer                       
              simulation of fiber motion during sheet forming as determined                  
              by electrostatic and hydrodynamic forces.
