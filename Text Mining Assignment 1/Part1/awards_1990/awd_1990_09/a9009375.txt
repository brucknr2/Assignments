Abstract    :
              Semantic analysis is automated analysis of programs, used to predict           
              their runtime behavior.  Such analysis is complicated by the inherent          
              difficulty of determining semantic properties of programs.  Existing           
              semantic analysis methods, such as data flow analysis and dependence           
              analysis, deal with this problem by seeking relatively weak semantic           
              information.  While these methods are efficient and useful, they               
              suffer from two drawbacks.  First, many have not been justified                
              rigorously.  The second drawback is the weakness of the semantic               
              information they provide.  To rectify these drawbacks, this project            
              will investigate (1) the development of new semantic analysis methods          
              based on analyzing path executability conditions and formal                    
              specifications and proofs; (2) the development of new applications of          
              semantic analysis; and (3) the development of prototype systems to             
              demonstrate new semantic analysis methods and applications.
