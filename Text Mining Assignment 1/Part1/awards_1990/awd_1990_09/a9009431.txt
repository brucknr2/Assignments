Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This SGER project will examine the feasibility of using lighter                
              than airships (blimps) to follow various aspects of cetacean                   
              biology such as the time/space variability in population                       
              structure, diving and submergence behavior, and migratory                      
              movements and behavior, as well as in depth studies of                         
              important breeding and nursery grounds along the US Atlantic                   
              coast.  The airship time is being donated by the FUJI                          
              corporation on its FUJI airship and by Metropolitan life on its                
              METLIFE blimp and thus the award involves an important                         
              commitment and cooperative effort with the private sector.  The                
              donated time will be provided on an opportunistic basis,                       
              dependent on primary commitments.  The project will evaluate                   
              and make recommendations on the use of these new advanced                      
              airships for ocean surveys of marine mammals and their habitats                
              and should further extend our basic understanding of space and                 
              time population variation and general behavior of these                        
              interesting and endangered organisms.
