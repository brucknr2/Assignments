Abstract    :
              The main objective of this research is to improve the performance of           
              I/O subsystems in parallel architectures.  I/O subsystem design is an          
              issue which is often ignored by parallel computer designers.  With the         
              fast advances in VLSI and multiprocessor technology the processing             
              power and main memory speeds have been increasing at rapid rates but           
              the I/O system has hardly seen any comparable improvements.  This              
              disparity in performance gives rise to the I/O bottleneck in parallel          
              architectures.  The proposed investigation focuses on issues related           
              to the improvement of I/O subsystem performance.  Emphasis will be             
              placed on I/O schemes for hypercube multiprocessor architectures.              
                                                                                             
              Efficient parallel I/O schemes for hypercube architectures are                 
              studied.  Simulations are done mainly using some I/O bound problems,           
              viz., external sorting, database manipulations, etc.  Parallel                 
              algorithms are developed for such problems on the hypercube with a             
              parallel I/O environment.  Furthermore, different disk organizations           
              and data distribution schemes for the parallel I/O systems will also           
              be evaluated.  The results obtained in this project will enable                
              researchers to design database and transaction processing systems and          
              provide insight for improving the performance of I/O subsystems on             
              other architectures.
