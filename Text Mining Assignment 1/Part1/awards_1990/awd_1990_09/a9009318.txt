Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to study space bounded computations.              
              Even though space bounded computations are somewhat less difficult to          
              analyze than time bounded computations, little is known regarding the          
              power of nondeterminism.  This research attempts to understand                 
              underlying combinatorics in space bounded computations by looking at           
              various restricted models of computation.  The DSPACE?log n! =?                
              NSPACE?log n! problem is approached by considering different models            
              such as sublog space bounded machines, universal traversal sequence            
              and multihead two way finite state automaton.  These restricted models         
              of computation raise interesting questions with direct consequence to          
              DSPACE?log n! =? NSPACE?log n! problem.  This research concentrates on         
              developing and using tools like communication complexity to show lower         
              bounds on space requirement in these models with the hope of                   
              understanding the space bounded computations.
