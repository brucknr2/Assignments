Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with improving the laser-heated                
              pedestal-growth method in order to grow long single crystalline                
              fibers of sapphire, yittrium aluminum garnet, titanium carbide,                
              titanium diboride, and barium fluoride.  Single crystal fibers of              
              these materials in lengths greater than one meter have not                     
              previously been grown.  These fibers will have potential widespread            
              applications in such areas as strengthening elements in structural             
              composite materials, and fiber optic sensors for medical and other             
              applications.
