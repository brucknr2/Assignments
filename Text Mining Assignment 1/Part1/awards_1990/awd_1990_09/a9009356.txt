Abstract    :
              An experimental study will be conducted, under a Research                      
              Initiation Award, of supersonic flow with shock waves interacting              
              with frictional boundary layers.  A novel focused Schlieren                    
              technique will be used to form holograms of the three-dimensional              
              density gradients in the flow field.                                           
                                                                                             
              The technique, if successful, could be implemented in conventional             
              high speed windtunnels, and thus perhaps gain widespread usage in              
              the future in the diagnosis of three-dimensional supersonic flows.
