Abstract    :
                   A broad program of research in theoretical physics will be                
              carried out.  It will include study of the observable                          
              consequences of expanded versions of the Standard Model that                   
              include multiple Higgs doublets, technicolor and/or                            
              supersymmetry, such as, for example, the large contributions to                
              the neutron electric dipole moment that arise in these models.                 
              Continued study of the phenomenology of superstrings, focussing                
              on model-independent predictions and on the search for a stable                
              vacuum with broken supersymmetry, will be undertaken, as will                  
              continued study of quantum gravity, and of the ground states of                
              string theory.                                                                 
                   This program of research addresses a number of very                       
              important questions regarding the behavior and properties of                   
              the elementary particles, and the unification of the forces of                 
              nature.
