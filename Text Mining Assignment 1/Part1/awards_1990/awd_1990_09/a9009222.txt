Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project outlines studies designed to evaluate                    
              developmental expression of IGF-I and IGF-II and their receptors               
              in the rat hippocampus.  The presence of the IGFs and their                    
              receptors in the fetal brain suggests a role for these peptides                
              in the development of the CNS.  Careful correlation between the                
              morphological stages of rat hippocampal development and the time               
              course of IGF protein and receptor expression will provide                     
              insight into a potential role for this system during development.              
              These studies will provide the first available information on                  
              developmental expression and localization of the IGFs and their                
              receptors in a defined brain area as well as defining changes in               
              IGF expression in response to a stimulus known to induce neural                
              plasticity: limbic seizures.
