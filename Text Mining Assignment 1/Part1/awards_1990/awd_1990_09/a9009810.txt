Abstract    :
              The attractive forces between cellulose fibers will be                         
              measured on the molecular level with the aid of a surface                      
              force apparatus.  Bare fibers and fibers with absorbed layers                  
              of polymeric binders will be used and the effects of moisture                  
              will be determined.  The results will be compared with                         
              results for Langmuir-Blodgett films deposited on the mica                      
              measuring surfaces of the apparatus.  The study will provide                   
              fundamental information on the structure-property relations                    
              for paper.
