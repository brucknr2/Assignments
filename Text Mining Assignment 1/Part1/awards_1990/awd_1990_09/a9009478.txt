Abstract    :
              This award will support study of the Japanese language by an                   
              American scientist or engineer by providing a stipend, tuition,                
              other course-related expenses.  The objectives of the program                  
              are to enable active U.S. scientists and engineers to acquire                  
              sufficient familiarity with the language and customs of Japan                  
              to allow them to function independently there; or to acquire                   
              sufficient expertise in reading Japanese to be able to                         
              understand technical abstracts in their field of interest.                     
                                                                                             
              There is a critical need for more effective technical                          
              communication between American and Japanese researchers.                       
              This award is intended to help remove language and cultural                    
              barriers to U.S.-Japanese cooperative research and to                          
              facilitate science and technology exchange.
