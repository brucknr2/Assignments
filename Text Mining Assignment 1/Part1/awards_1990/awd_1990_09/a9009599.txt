Abstract    :
              This project explores the implications of imperfect information                
              for the functioning of the capital market, the implications of                 
              these derived properties of the capital markets for the behavior               
              of firms, the implications of these derived characteristics of firm            
              behavior for the macroeconomic performance of the economy, and the             
              potential ensuing consequences for tax policy, for macroeconomic               
              stabilization and growth policies, and for government interventions            
              in the capital markets.  A basic objective of the project is the               
              construction of a general macroeconomic model incorporating in a               
              consistent way central aspects of financial markets, together with             
              results derived from earlier work on how imperfect information                 
              affects product and labor markets.                                             
                                                                                             
              This project also enhances our understanding of the consequences               
              of different organizational forms for organizational performance,              
              in the presence of imperfect information, e.g., with respect to                
              decision making (the selection of projects, the selection and                  
              assignment of managers), and the design of incentive structures.               
                                                                                             
              This grant is an accomplishment-based renewal.  Funding is provided            
              because of the high quality, pathbreaking research in the 103                  
              papers and 3 books completed by the investigator under his last NSF            
              grant and because of future contributions from this extremely                  
              productive project.  Research takes place in six interrelated                  
              areas: (1) the economics of information; (2) the implications of               
              imperfect information for the economy's macroeconomic performance;             
              (3) welfare economics; (4) the theory of innovation and market                 
              structure; (5) the economics of organizations; and (6) public                  
              finance and development.
