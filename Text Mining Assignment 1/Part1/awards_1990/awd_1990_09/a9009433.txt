Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Brazil Science and Technology Initiative (STI) award                 
              will support a program planning workshop in the area of natural                
              products chemistry.  The purpose of the workshop, organized by                 
              Professor Bruce Jarvis of the University of Maryland and                       
              Professor Otto Gottlieb of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil,                
              is to stimulate cooperative research between U.S. and Brazilian                
              chemists.  As such, the workshop will address the following                    
              topics: diagnostic of on-going research efforts in both the U.S.               
              and Brazil in the area of natural products chemistry; identifi-                
              cation of areas of common interests and likely future collabo-                 
              rators; and organization of joint planning activities for                      
              cooperation in the short, medium, and long term.
