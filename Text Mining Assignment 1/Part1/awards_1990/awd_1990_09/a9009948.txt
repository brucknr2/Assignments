Abstract    :
              The research to be carried out by the ten co-principal                         
              investigators involves experimental techniques drawn from molecular            
              biology and protein biochemistry to study: (1) protein                         
              structure/function relationships; (2) the ability of plants to                 
              synthesize cellulose and to respond to temperature stress and (3)              
              evolutionary relationships in reptiles and mammals.  The requested             
              instrumentation, which will constitute the core biological                     
              facility, will provide a central, shared group of modern                       
              instruments that will enable the co-P.I.'s and other research                  
              faculty in the three co-operating academic departments represented             
              in this proposal; to isolate proteins on a large scale; to purify              
                                                                                             
              proteins, peptides and oligonucleotides to homogeneity; to isolate,            
                                                                                             
              purify and amplify DNA samples; to obtain amino acid resolution of             
                                                                                             
              proteins; to analyze electrophoresis results quickly and with high             
                                                                                             
              DNA and to carry out site-directed mutagenesis.
