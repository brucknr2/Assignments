Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to comprehensively examine and                 
              critically assess Friedrich von Hayek's contribution to                        
              methodology in economics.  Hayek is a Nobel Prize winner and a                 
              leader of the Austrian Economics movement.  He has written                     
              extensively about social science methodology, but no                           
              comprehensive analysis or assessment of his contribution exists.               
              Of particular interest are the origins of Hayek's views, how he                
              justified them, and the internal consistency of his                            
              methodological approach.  The relationship between Hayek's ideas               
              on methodology and those of a number of other twentieth century                
              economists and philosophers will also be examined.  The positions              
              of Ludwig von Mises, Karl Popper, and Milton Friedman will                     
              receive extended attention.  The primary method of research will               
              be a through review of the written work of Hayek and of related                
              authors.  Nearly five hundred pages of transcripts from                        
              interviews of Hayek held during the late 1970's will also be                   
              analyzed.  This research will be of value to scholars interested               
              in the methodology of economics and in the history of economic                 
              doctrine, and more broadly to the philosophers and historians of               
              science.
