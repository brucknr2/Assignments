Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on the role of                            
              solution chemistry, chemical characteristics of the solid-                     
              solution interface and colloidal interactions with porous                      
              media on the transport of colloids in groundwater.                             
              Objectives of this project are to develop a theoretical                        
              framework for these phenomena and then to conduct                              
              laboratory experiments to evaluate the chemical factors                        
              that affect movement of colloids in porous media aquifers.                     
              The approach planned in developing the transport model                         
              will be to combine fundamental theories of mass transfer,                      
              consideration of the hydrodynamics of colloids in porous                       
              media, colloidal interaction and stability.                                    
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this award was submitted in accord                     
              with the NSF Program Announcement:  Research Initiation                        
              Awards, NSF 88-99.  Results are expected to provide a                          
              scientific base for characterizing the fate of colloidal                       
              particles that are suspended in water as they move through                     
              a porous medium such as a groundwater aquifer or a                             
              filtration process in a water treatment system.  In                            
              addition to their role as pollutants, colloidal particles                      
              can serve as the vehicle for transport of bacteria and                         
              viruses.  Results of this research may also be applied to                      
              engineering design of systems to isolate aquifers from                         
              potential contamination by seepage from hazardous waste                        
              disposal sites.
