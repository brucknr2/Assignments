Abstract    :
              The specific goal of this project is the generation of the                     
              diasatereomeric 4-substituted phenacyl methylposphonate adducts                
              of chymotrypsin and trypsin-like enzymes.  It includes the                     
              synthesis of the 4-nitrophenyl esters of respective inhibitors                 
              (PMNs), the study of phosphonylation by the their enantiomers,                 
              and, in particular of the self-stimulated dephosphonylation                    
              reactions.  Rational selection of the substituents in the 4-                   
              position of phenancyl will provide inhibitors that will                        
              regenerate enzyme activity on different time scales.  The                      
              potential for medical use of these compounds as modifiers of                   
              serine hydrolase activity through controllable                                 
              inactivation/regeneration cycles is suggested.                                 
                                                                                             
              Synthesis of the compounds and kinetic measurements will involve               
              conventional techniques.  Non-bonded interactions in the                       
              diastereomeric adducts will be evaluated by molecular graphics                 
              and mechanics calculations, in an independent, complementary                   
              research project. Results of all the investigations will then be               
              used to assess the use of phosphonate esters as active site                    
              probes of serine hydrolases.  Acetycholinesterase, for which no                
              structural information is presently available, will be the target              
              of similar studies in the future.
