Abstract    :
              Description:  This project supports participation of ten U.S.                  
              scientists in "The International Conference in Game Theory and its             
              Application" scheduled for December 18-22, 1990 at the Indian                  
              Statistical Institute (ISI) in New Delhi.  The Indian organizer is             
              Dr. T. Parthasarathy of ISI.  The conference is planned to cover               
              the following topics:  Non Cooperative Game Theory, Trade and                  
              Development, Dynamic Games, Cooperative Games, Industrial                      
              Organization and Contracts and Organization design.  It is expected            
              that participants will come from the U.S., the U.S.S.R., Western               
              Europe, Japan, Poland and India.  Proceedings are expected to be               
              published.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Scope:  Over 50 U.S. scientists have been invited.  India is                   
              expected to have a strong delegation from its well respected                   
              institute such as the ISI in New Delhi and in Calcutta, the Indian             
              Institute of Management, the New Delhi School of Economics and from            
              other universities.  Some of these Indian scientists have had                  
              considerable research careers in top U.S. universities.  The                   
              exchange of information is likely to be highly stimulating and to              
              lead to new research activities.
