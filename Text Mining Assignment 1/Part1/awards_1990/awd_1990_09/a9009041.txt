Abstract    :
                   Professors Curtis and Bade will continue their research into              
              the underlying structural relationship between the radical in a                
              non-semisimple Banach algebra and the algebra which contains it.               
              This problem will be pursued in the context of amenable or weakly              
              amenable Banach algebras. Particular attention will be paid to                 
              non-semisimple algebras arising from sets of non spectral                      
              synthesis for group algebras of locally compact abelian groups                 
              and for the associated Beurling algebras.                                      
                   Banach algebras are composed of abstract objects which can                
              be added or multiplied, but the exact form of the multiplication               
              rule is purposely not specified so that the results obtained                   
              apply to very many situations.  Concrete examples of Banach                    
              algebras are plentiful, and this research will help elucidate                  
              their structure.
