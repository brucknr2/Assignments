Abstract    :
              The overall objective of the proposed research is to elucidate                 
              the mechanisms by which transcriptional regulation influences the              
              cell tropism of retroviruses.  As a model system, the P.I. is                  
              studying the contribution of the transcriptional enhancer of a                 
              replication competent mouse retrovirus, the Moloney murine                     
              leukemia virus.  There are multiple binding sites for host                     
              nuclear transcription factors on the Moloney virus enhancer.  One              
              of these binding sites, the Leukemia Virus fact b (LVb) site is                
              the most highly conserved sequence in the enhancers of mammalian               
              type C retroviruses.  There is indication that a protein(s) that               
              binds the LVb site contributes significantly to the pathogenesis               
              of the Moloney virus.  Dr. Speck plans to characterize, purify                 
              and obtain molecular clones encoding the nuclear DNA-binding                   
              protein that binds to the LVb site in the Moloney virus enhancer,              
              and most likely to the enhancers of many mammalian C-type                      
              retroviruses.
