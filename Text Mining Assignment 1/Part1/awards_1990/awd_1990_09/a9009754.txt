Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to explore the microstructural                    
              details and macroscopic consequences of polymer grafted                        
              colloidal particles in aqueous media.  Novel grafting                          
              techniques utilizing biochemical linking agents will be used                   
              to graft poly(ethylene oxide) or other polymers onto                           
              functionalized polystyrene or silica particles.  The efficacy                  
              of the analytical techniques, including UV absorbance, NMR                     
              spectroscopy, static and dynamic light scattering, and                         
              dielectric spectroscopy.  Rheological measurements, including                  
              capillary viscometry, steady shear and constant stress                         
              viscometry, oscillation, and stress relaxation, yield insights                 
              regarding polymer-mediated interparticle forces and the                        
              suspension microstructure.  The dielectric spectroscopy                        
              technique will be extended to concentrated suspensions                         
              containing grafted polymer.  These measurements will be                        
              combined with extended theoretical models of polymer layer                     
              structure, interparticle forces, and suspension rheology in                    
              order to rationalize the observed equilibrium properties and                   
              dynamic behavior.
