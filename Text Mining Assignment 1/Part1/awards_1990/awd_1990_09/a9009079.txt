Abstract    :
              Voltage collapse ia a loss of stability in                                     
              large scale electric power systems which                                       
              causes blackout when voltages decrease                                         
              catastrophically.  Explanations of voltage                                     
              collapse involving various subsystems                                          
              (generators, transformers, loads is unknown).                                  
              The main purpose of the research is to                                         
              determine which subsystems and parameters are                                  
              primarily responsible for voltage collapse so                                  
              that a simple power system model capturing the                                 
              main causes of voltage collapse may be                                         
              developed.  Such a model would form the basis                                  
              for the scientific understanding and                                           
              prevention of voltage collapse.                                                
                                                                                             
              Voltage collapse is generally associated with                                  
              bifurcation of the nonlinear power system                                      
              equations; that is, the disappearance as                                       
              parameters vary of the stable equilibrium at                                   
              which the power system is normally operated.                                   
              The goal of the proposed research is to                                        
              determine how the subsystems and parameters                                    
              contribute to the bifurcation (and hence the                                   
              voltage collapse) by studying the geometry of                                  
              the bifurcation and reducing the condition for                                 
              bifurcation to a simpler form.  Other                                          
              parameterised nonlinear systems lose stability                                 
              in a similar way and most of the techniques                                    
              developed will apply generally.
