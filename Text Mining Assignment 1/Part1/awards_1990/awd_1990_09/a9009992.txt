Abstract    :
              Production of pharmaceutical and fine chemicals ("secondary                    
              metabolites") from plant tissue culture has been recognized                    
              as a worthwhile objective for many years, but the potential                    
              of this technology has been limited.  A major reason is the                    
              genetic instability of cell culture for continuous                             
              production on a large scale.  A novel plant culture system                     
              is "hairy" root cultures.  The PI has established in her                       
              laboratory productive and stable "hairy" root cultures for                     
              Catharanthus roseus (periwinkle).  The proposed research                       
              involves investigating the metabolism of hairy root                            
              cultures in order to understand the factors which limit                        
              production of secondary metabolites.  Growth kinetics and                      
              alkaloid production will be monitored by high performance                      
              liquid chromatography (HPLC) for different hairy root                          
              clones in flask cultures.  The physiological state and                         
              carbon flows of the cell culture will be monitored                             
              noninvasively in a perfusion reactor by 31P and 13C Nuclear                    
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  This dual approach                     
              will enhance fundamental understanding of the metabolic                        
              cellular processes limiting alkaloid production.
