Abstract    :
              This proposal is to develop instrumentation to study the                       
              morphology and organization of a cell during detachment                        
              of the cell from a surface.  The detachment will be                            
              caused by aspiration through a micropipette; observations                      
              of the cell-substrate interface will be made using total                       
              internal reflection fluorescence.  Cell adhesion plays a                       
              crucial role in both biomedical and bioprocessing                              
              problems such as bioreactor design, tumor cell metastasis                      
              and the triggering of inflammatory responses.  The                             
              proposed methodology should greatly facilitate                                 
              quantitative, engineering-oriented research in these                           
              important areas.
