Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Muscle movements are carefully controlled during posture by               
              mechanical impedance.  This is an area where neuroscientists can               
              apply the accuracy of control systems analysis to quantitatively               
              analyse how a single neuron matches the mechanical stress on the               
              muscle as relayed by mechanoreceptor input with the maintainence               
              of a movement or posture.  To do this cells which control a                    
              single reflex will be recorded in the hermit crab and experiments              
              carried out to test the cell response to quantifiable resistances              
              applied to the leg movement. The data will be analysed                         
              mathematically.  The results will determine which mathematical                 
              model best describes the way in which a neuron maintains posture               
              and stiffness in a complete motor reflex.  This kind of                        
              information has important consequences for the understanding of                
              movement and efficiency of neuronal systems.
