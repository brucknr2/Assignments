Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Aprille's                 
              sabbatical work, which will be carried out in her home                         
              institution (Tufts University).  The goal of the project is to                 
              study molecular-genetic aspects of postnatal development of                    
              mitochondrial function in mammalian liver.                                     
                                                                                             
              Dr. Aprille has an established record of productivity in the area              
              of physiological aspects of postnatal mitochondrial development.               
              This sabbatical year will provide her with the opportunity to                  
              collaborate with and learn molecular genetic techniques from her               
              colleague, Dr. Susan Ernst.  The acquisition of molecular                      
              techniques will allow Dr. Aprille to make some unique                          
              contributions to her field, and is anticipated to significantly                
              enhance her career.
