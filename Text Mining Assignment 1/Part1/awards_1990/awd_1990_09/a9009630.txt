Abstract    :
              These researchers request partial support for the acquisition of               
              a high temperature stage and control unit, modern x-ray detection              
              and control electronics, and a computer to enhance and upgrade                 
              an existing x-ray diffraction facility in the Department of                    
              Physics and  Astronomy at the University of Delaware.  This                    
              facility will be used in structural studies of artificially                    
              structured materials.
