Abstract    :
              A novel class of cell adhesion substrates has been                             
              developed and partially characterized.  These materials                        
              contain covalently attached peptide ligands for                                
              cell-surface receptors, and the particular structure of                        
              these peptides is based on the structure of proteins,                          
              called cell adhesion molecules, that mediate cell                              
              adhesion.  Such an approach to cell attachment substrates                      
              provides a significant engineering advantage in enhanced                       
              control, specificity, stability, and synthetic ease.                           
              These materials may have important applications in cell                        
              culture technology and biomedical materials technology.
