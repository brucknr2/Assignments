Abstract    :
              This research is on performance driven partitioning for high speed and         
              high density circuit design.  Tools for an automatic partitioning system       
              which divides circuits from the system level to basic layout modules are       
              being developed.  For systems of several million gates, a technique,           
              called the ratio cut, is used to define the hierarchy of the system.           
              The ratio cut is used to identify the cluster structure and thus               
              organize the system into a tree structure.  A heuristic ratio cut              
              algorithm is being explored for use in hierarchal partitioning of the          
              design.  Once a partition has been made there is an optimization               
              problem.  Solutions to this problem are being investigated using neural        
              nets, partitioning on special graphs and other methods.
