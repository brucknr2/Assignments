Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  This research is undertaken in order to prepare a reference               
              grammar of Itza Maya, Yucatecan Mayan language currently spoken                
              by small groups in Peten, Guatemala.  There are no modern                      
              reference grammars for any of the extant Yucatecan languages.                  
              Prior to European contact, Yucatecan languages were recorded                   
              hieroglyphically.  Itza Maya is a dying language, and it is                    
              important for Mayan linguistics and epigraphy to record it before              
              it disappears.                                                                 
                   On the basis of extensive previous research on the language               
              as well as new fieldwork, a comprehensive, heavily exemplified                 
              grammar will be prepared for use by linguists, anthropologists,                
              epigraphers, and others interested in a general reference work                 
              for this important language.
