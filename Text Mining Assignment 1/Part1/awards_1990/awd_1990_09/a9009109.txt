Abstract    :
              This is part of a joint project at Carnegie Mellon University and              
              the University of Southern California to build a massively parallel            
              processor and use it for natural language translation.                         
                                                                                             
              The system to be built is an array of custom processors that are               
              specialized for marker passing in semantic networks.  A specific               
              goal of this project is to implement a real-time speech-to-speech              
              dialogue translation system with about 500 words in its vocabulary.            
              This system will necessarily include natural language understanding            
              and generation components.  The culmination of this project will               
              be an array of 16,384 semantic network nodes with software                     
              implementing the translation system.
