Abstract    :
                   The changes currently reshaping the geography of manufacturing            
              activities in the U.S. have received considerable scholarly attention.         
              Among the important questions being asked are:  How have changing              
              technologies altered the locational requirements of firms? and How have        
              changing forms of management altered the relationships among firms?            
              This is not the first time that American industry has undergone                
              dramatic transformations, however.  From 1860 to 1880, new technologies        
              and management practices fundamentally altered the locational structure        
              of American manufacturing.  This project will examine the formation and        
              development of industrial complexes in large northeastern U.S.                 
              metropolises from 1860 to 1880.  Manufacturing data based on 4-digit           
              standard industrial codes will be used to analyze the changing mixes of        
              16 metropolitan complexes.  These data analyses will be complemented by        
              reviews of articles in business periodicals and by case studies of             
              selected firms and industries that will seek to identify and explain           
              the decision making of entrepreneurs, the market areas of goods, and           
              linkages among firms.  Case studies of industrial complexes in Chicago,        
              Cincinnati, New York, and the Pittsburgh-Cleveland corridor will               
              amplify on the relationships detected in the general study.                    
                   This research will complement work already completed in many of           
              the study areas, enhancing our knowledge about the complex dynamics at         
              work in the evolution of major American industrial centers in the              
              latter part of the 19th Century.  Even more importantly, it will               
              provide the basis for elaboration of a model of metropolitan industrial        
              complex development.  This model will provide a basis for assessing            
              other industrial transformations in the past, and it will provide a new        
              perspective for evaluating contemporary manufacturing growth.
