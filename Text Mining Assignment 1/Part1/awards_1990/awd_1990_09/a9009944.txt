Abstract    :
              Studies are being conducted which if successful will demonstrate the           
              feasibility of universities fabricating in a few hours their own low-          
              cost prototype multichip modules (MCM).  MCMs represent a state-of-the-        
              art microsystems packaging technique, improving speed and power by             
              factors of three or more.  Current industrial MCM fabrication costs are        
              prohibitive in prototype quantities to universities.  The cost reduction       
              and short turnaround time offered by this novel concept along with other       
              fast prototyping methodologies have the potential to revolutionize             
              microsystems design.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The concept is to have standard pattern substrates mass produced by            
              industry at low cost.  Each substrate would have buried patterns of            
              power and ground wiring, plus a buried level of signal wiring.  All            
              buried wiring would have strategically placed paths called vias to a           
              surface layer.  This surface layer would be a pattern of wiring                
              including connections to the vias which could be cut by the universities       
              to customize for a particular design.  Pretested bare chips with solder        
              bumps would be bonded to the customized substrate to form the customized       
              module.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The concept is being demonstrated by 1) designing, fabricating and             
              testing the substrates and two types of memory MCMs, 2) functional             
              design only of two other complex modules.
