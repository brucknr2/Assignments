Abstract    :
                   Two goals of this proposal are to extend some known results               
              for the uniform random mapping model to other interesting random               
              mapping models, and to initiate new research on probabilistic                  
              optimization problems.  The work on random mapping models is a                 
              continuation of work already completed by the principal                        
              investigator.  In particular, the principal investigator is                    
              interested in determining new central limit theorems and                       
              functional limit theorem for certain random mapping models.  The               
              investigation of probabilistic optimization problems is related                
              to the study of random mapping models, as both rely, in various                
              ways, on the theory of random graphs.  Since the second topic of               
              this proposal is a new area of research for the investigator, the              
              planning activities that will be carried out are primarily                     
              intended to prepare the proposer to work independently in this                 
              field.
