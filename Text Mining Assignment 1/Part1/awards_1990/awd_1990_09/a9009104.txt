Abstract    :
                    The Younger Dryas event in earth history provides an                     
              important example of a rapid climate change forced by no known                 
              external cause. Thus understanding the mechanisms for this change              
              will help to evaluate the internal feedbacks affecting climate.                
              The research outlined in this proposal is important because it                 
              will determine the geographic extent of the climatic event in                  
              North America.  Its scientific approach combines proven and new,               
              experimental methods for precise dating of paleoclimate records                
              and therefore will help to resolve some long-standing and                      
              confusing discrepencies in the paleoclimate records of western                 
              North America.
