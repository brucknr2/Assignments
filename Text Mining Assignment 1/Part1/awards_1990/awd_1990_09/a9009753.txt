Abstract    :
              On-line problems arise in many important, practical settings, such as          
              operating systems, programming language implementations, and robotics.         
              These problems involve sequences of requests that must be processed on         
              the fly.                                                                       
              The goal of the project is to find fast algorithms and to prove lower          
              bounds for on-line problems in sets and graphs, two fundamental                
              mathematical objects that are used to model a myriad of computer               
              applications.  The project will investigate problems which arise in            
              logic programming and that involve varying sets of variables.  It will         
              also study problems of maintaining information about graphs that are           
              changing on-line.  Such changing graphs model applications in circuit          
              simulation, networks, and distributed computing.  Solving on-line              
              problems involves the development of dynamic data structures, which            
              are sophisticated tools for quickly accessing and modifying stored             
              information.  Dynamic data structures often have uses in other areas           
              of computer science.  A final goal of the project is to investigate            
              whether certain on-line problems in sets and graphs are inherently             
              difficult.  The project will improve the understanding of theoretical          
              issues relevant to practical problems, and hopefully give better               
              solutions to those problems.
