Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal represents and ROW research planning grant.  The                 
              research proposed will continue comparative studies on the                     
              mechanical response of invertebrate worm tentacles, when                       
              exposed to forces encountered during the feeding process, and                  
              how the responses relate to the structure of the tentacle and                  
              to the microscopic organization of the tissue of which it is                   
              composed.  The relationship between the mechanical properties                  
              and the tissue organization of invertebrate feeding tentacle                   
              are of particular interest because tentacles capture food in                   
              diverse ways ranging from removal of suspended matter from                     
              moving water to the removal of particles from a substratum.                    
              This project addresses important aspects of cell and tissue                    
              structure and function and should lend considerable insight                    
              into what mechanisms can permit some cells and tissues to                      
              undergo large deformations and to recover their prestrained                    
              shapes.
