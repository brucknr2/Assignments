Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research, by one of the leaders in advancing our theoretical              
              understanding of accretion phenomena, will investigate the                     
              generation of radiation by accreting systems on both stellar and               
              galactic scales.  It will address the problem of bringing material             
              close enough to the central black hole in active galaxies to                   
              produce the radiation observed. The evolution of low mass X-ray                
              binary systems will also be studied.
