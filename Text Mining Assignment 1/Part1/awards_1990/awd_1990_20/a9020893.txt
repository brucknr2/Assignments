Abstract    :
                   This project continues research on shared virtual memory for              
              multicomputers and further research on fault tolerant, real-time,              
              parallel systems based on shared virtual memory.  Such a system will           
              be called persistent shared virtual memory.  The system research is            
              based on the principal investigator's previous research:  shared               
              virtual memory for multicomputers, concurrent real-time methods for            
              checkpointing, garbage collection, main-memory transaction processing.         
              Design methods for persistent memory management for a large class of           
              multicomputers are studied and a persistent shared virtual memory              
              system for the Intel iPSC/2 and iPSC/i860 multicomputers will be               
              implemented.
