Abstract    :
                   The question of the limits of predictability of the                       
              atmosphere is one of the more fundamental questions facing                     
              meteorologists.  Most of the research performed in this area has               
              emphasized predictability characteristics of large-scale                       
              atmospheric flows.  Based on these earlier studies, pessimistic                
              conclusions were drawn for the forecasting of localized weather                
              events (e.g. heavy rainfall), termed mesoscale events by                       
              meteorologists.  More recent work, however, has provided                       
              evidence that forecasting of mesoscale weather may not be as                   
              limited as originally suggested; however, not much research has                
              been done in this area.                                                        
                   Using a numerical model, the Principal Investigator will                  
              perform a number of experiments designed to address the question               
              of predictability of mesoscale precipitation.  Some of the tasks               
              to be undertaken are to determine the variation of range of                    
              predictability of mesoscale precipitation with respect to                      
              temporal and spatial averaging; and to use the concepts of chaos               
              theory and strange attractors to characterize the precipitation                
              process.
