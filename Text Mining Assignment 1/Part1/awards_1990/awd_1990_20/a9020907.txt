Abstract    :
                   This Research Opportunity Award funds a project "Diffusivity              
              of Gases through Aseptic Food Packaging Materials and Seals" at                
              North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in                  
              support of North Carolina State Univesity's Industry/University                
              Cooperative Research Center for Aseptic Processing and Packaging.              
              This two year project is reporting to the Center's Industry                    
              Advisory Board.                                                                
                   The research is studying the effective diffusivity of gases               
              through media used in the packaging and sealing of foods.                      
                   The researchers are competent and have the facilities to                  
              perform the research.                                                          
                   The Program Manager recommends North Carolina Agriculture and             
              Technical State University be awarded $100,000 for two (2) years.
