Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research award will support the linguistic and               
              ethnographic research of a cultural anthropologist on the Navajo               
              Indian reservation.  The project will investigate the                          
              significance of a linguistic term denoting the abstract creation               
              principle of "non-constancy" as well as "Navajo mythological                   
              figures", and "berdache" (meaning Native Americans who adopt the               
              behavior, dress, and/or sexual preferences of the opposite sex).               
              Methods will include linguistic and ethnographic interviews with               
              medicine people as well as people identified by the term                       
              ("nadleeh"), and archival research.                                            
                                                                                             
              This research will add to our knowledge of "berdache", and                     
              important element of Native American culture that has been                     
              clearly understood.  In addition knowledge of the community                    
              understanding and values on these issues can help regional health              
              specialists to understand Native American sexual behavior, which               
              can help develop culturally relevant AIDS prevention strategies.
