Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The cellular mechanisms used to regulate the rate of degradation               
              of insoluble vs. soluble forms of cellulose and starch by anaerobic            
              bacteria in continuous cultures are the objects of this research.              
              A variety of cellulolytic anaerobes, as well as some that are                  
              amylolytic will be analyzed in terms of: kinetics of growth,                   
              substrate disappearance, and product formation; the production of              
              cellulase and cellobiase activities (for cellulolytic bacteria) and            
              amylase and malatase activities (for amylolytic bacteria); the                 
              realtionships between enzyme activities and rates of substrate                 
              utilization; the influence of growth substrate on enzyme production            
              (constitutive vs. induced); and effects of particle size and                   
              concentration on kinetics of insoluble cellulose decomposition.                
              These studies will aid in understanding a very important aspect of             
              the global carbon cycle--microbial growth on insoluble biopolymers.//
