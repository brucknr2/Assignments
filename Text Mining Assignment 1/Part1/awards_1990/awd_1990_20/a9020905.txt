Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action funds a Small Grant for Exploratory Research                       
              (SGER) in plant-pathogen interactions.  The mechanism by                       
              which breakdown products of the plant cell wall are                            
              transported or taken up into phytopathogenic Xanthomonas,                      
              Erwinia and Fusarium species is the major focus of this                        
              research.  The uptake of radiolabeled galacturonic acid into                   
              plant pathogens is being measured to determine the kinetics                    
              of transport, the number of transport systems, and the                         
              inducibility of cell wall degrading enzymes.                                   
                                                                                             
              The SGER mechanism was selected for this project because of                    
              the high cost of custom synthesis for the requisite                            
              radiolabeled compound.  The element of risk involved is more                   
              than would normally be assumed in a fully funded, multi-year                   
              project.  Some preliminary observations make a strong case                     
              for the project and it is highly likely that new information                   
              will be gained of a basic nature as well as on the processes                   
              of soft-rot diseases of many agriculturally important                          
              plants.***
