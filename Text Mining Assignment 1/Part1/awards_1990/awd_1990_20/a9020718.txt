Abstract    :
              The long term goals of this project are to determine the                       
              structure, the mechanism of transposition, and the possible                    
              regulatory function of Tad, a LINE-like transposable element from              
              Neurospora crassa.  Tad is a 7 kilobase transposable found in                  
              multiple copies in the Ivory Coast strain, Adiopodoume, and its                
              derivatives, but not in other strains (over 400 tested).  The Tad              
              element has no terminal repeats, but it has internal regions of                
              homology with both the gag and pol genes of retroviruses and                   
              retrotransposons.  The sequence of one Tad elements, which proved              
              to be defective, was determined. A functional Tad element has                  
              been cloned.  We will determine the sequence of this functional                
              element and compare the sequence to other elements as well as the              
              nonfunctional element already sequenced.  The location of the                  
              major promoters will be determined using gene fusion techniques.               
              Cis-acting sequences important for transposition will be                       
              determine using engineering constructs.  An intron will also be                
              introduced to determine whether Tad transposes via and RNA                     
              intermediate as expected from its structure.  The effects of an                
              adjacent Tad element on the expression of the am gene will be                  
              addressed.  Tad will also be tested for mutator function, reverse              
              transcriptase activity, and what effects RIP has on this                       
              elements.
