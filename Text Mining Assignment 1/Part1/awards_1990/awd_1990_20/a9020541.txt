Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research                            
              project between Dr. Frank Tittel of Williiam Marsh                             
              Rice University and Dr. Zsolt Por of JATE University,                          
              Szeged, is to pursue two related topics:  1) novel                             
              ultrashort laser pulse techniques and 2) production                            
              of nanostructures using direct laser ablation or                               
              photochemical processing.  These efforts are                                   
              intended to contribute to development of new                                   
              broadband ultrashort laser pulse amplifiers, and to                            
              advance our understanding of the production of                                 
              nanostructures using direct laser ablation.                                    
              Results of this project should contribute to our                               
              knowledge of basic physical mechanisms of UV laser                             
              ablation of polymers and should offer insight on such                          
              important questions as whether new photochemically                             
              induced absorbers are formed by direct photo                                   
              dissociation, radical formation after a chemical                               
              reaction, or other photochemical processes.                                    
              Results may lead to refinements for an interferometer                          
              capable of producing nanostructures in organic                                 
              materials by direct laser etching.                                             
                                                                                             
              This project in quantum electronics, waves and beams                           
              fulfills the program objective of advancing                                    
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers                           
              in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                             
              complementary talents and pool research resources                              
              in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
