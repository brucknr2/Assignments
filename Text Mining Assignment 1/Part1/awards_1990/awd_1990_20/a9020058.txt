Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A pilot investigation of the effects of parasites on howler                    
              monkeys on Barro Colorado Island, Panama will be conducted.  The               
              effects and biological costs of parasites on natural populations               
              of nonhuman primates are poorly known and this well-known,                     
              habituated island population is a good choice for an                           
              initial study.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Two specific parasites will be investigated by this                            
              inter-disciplinary team.  The pathology and infestation rates for              
              the howler monkey bot fly larvae will be documented as will those              
              for the howler malarial parasite (Plasmodium brazilianum).                     
              Additionally, there will be an attempt to determine the effects                
              of environmental stress (climatic, nutritional etc) on                         
              infestation rates.
