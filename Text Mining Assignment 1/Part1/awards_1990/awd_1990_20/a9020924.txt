Abstract    :
              The author of this SGER proposal aims to synthesize and                        
              characterize novel molecular ferromagnets.  Binickelocenium                    
              triiodide is the target molecule for this synthesis project.  It               
              is an attractive candidate for molecular ferromagnetism since the              
              complex is mixed-valent, and the electronic structure of this                  
              ferromagnet matches theoretically predicted electronic structure               
              configurations.  Also, the solid state structure is predicted to               
              be a stacked-array with nearest neighbor contacts closer than                  
              other known molecular ferromagnets.  The project will include                  
              studies of the conductivity and magnetism of binickelocenium as a              
              function of concentration of dopants to include iodine and                     
              arsenic pentafluoride.
