Abstract    :
                   The idea that ecological processes such as competition and                
              predication influence assemblages of species has been a common                 
              theme ever since the scientific method was applied to ecological               
              systems.  Such factors have been posited as explanations for many              
              of the patterns seen in nature.  The P.I. will investigate                     
              competitive hierarchies (species A always beats species B and C,               
              and B always beats C) can be altered to such that an extent that               
              an intransitive relationship (i.e.,) species A beats species B,                
              which beats species C, which beats species A) using several                    
              invasion sequences which resulted in a change in ordering of the               
              intransitivity.  The P.I. propose a series of experiments                      
              designed to explore competition for resources based on                         
              physiological, population, and community level factors.  The                   
              experimentation and theoretical analysis of this phenomenon                    
              promises to uncover ecological mechanics which may very well                   
              recast some of the current views of interspecific competition.
