Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Western New Mexico University is establishing a connection to                  
              NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line through the New Mexico                
              TECHNET state network and the WESTNET mid-level network.  The                  
              connection enhances collaborations of campus scientists with                   
              colleagues at other institutions, and allows access to libraries               
              and other remote facilities throughout the internet.  This award               
              funds part of the costs for two years.***
