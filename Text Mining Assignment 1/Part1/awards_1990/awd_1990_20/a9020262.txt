Abstract    :
                   The research to be carried out includes the following:                     
                  1.  A program of precise wavelength measurements of energy                
              levels of atomic helium at an accuracy which will provide a test               
              of current theoretical calculations.                                           
                   2.  Precise measurements of the ionization potential of                   
              molecular hydrogen, to be done in collaboration with  Edward                   
              Eyler of the University of Delaware.                                           
                   3.  Theoretical work on correlation effects in atom-atom                  
              collisions, to be done in collaboration with Kate Kirby of the                 
              Harvard Smithsonian Observatory.
