Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Harte will evaluate the feasibility of a novel approach to                 
              field manipulations for investigating the ecological consequences              
              of global warming.  The approach uses an array of infrared                     
              radiators suspended three meters above the ground.  This provides              
              a relatively simple, reliable, and realistic way to simulate                   
              additional surface warming in-situ.  Field trials of the                       
              procedure will be conducted in replicated experimental and                     
              control plots in undisturbed montane grasslands at the Rocky                   
              Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) in Colorado.  Additional                 
              infrared flux is designed to produce a nearly uniform soil                     
              temperature rise over the experimental plots that is commensurate              
              with that predicted by general circulation models for the gird in              
              which the site is located.  Dr. Harte is an expert in the area of              
              ecology, biological conservation, and causes and consequences of               
              climate change.  The facilities for this research are                          
              outstanding.
