Abstract    :
                   The proposed research represents a continuation of isotopic               
              measurements of atmospheric species and reactions of direct                    
              importance to tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry.  The PI                
              proposes to conduct five individual tasks: (1) Recent kinetic                  
              measurements by Troe et al. for O + O2 + M recombination have                  
              shown that, at pressures to 1,000 bar pressure, the rate constant              
              varies in an unpredicted fashion which may be related to the                   
              anomalous 18O, 17O fractionation in O3 formation and in the                    
              stratosphere, which is presently not understood.  High pressure,               
              variable temperature, bath gas experiments are proposed to                     
              resolve the role of electronic excitation and radical complex                  
              mechanisms upon isotopic fractionation in O3 formation and to                  
              define the mechanism of the mass independent oxygen isotopic                   
              fractionation process in O3 formation.  (2) Using presently                    
              developed experimental and theoretical techniques, the PI                      
              proposes to measure the rate of isotopic exchange between the                  
              species O3-O2-O and CO2,H2O, N2O and CO.  Anomalously large 18O                
              enrichments exist in stratospheric O3,H2O and CO2, but which are               
              not understood.  There are no measurements of most of the                      
              isotopic exchange rates needed to model these reactions.  (3) The              
              PI has found a new isotope effect in the thermal decomposition of              
              O3.  He proposes to resolve this mechanism as it is of importance              
              to general isotopic fractionation processes and chemical                       
              reactions.  (4) A variable 17O/18O ratio in atmospheric CO2 has                
              been measured, which the PI has demonstrated is removed by CO2-                
              H2O exchange.  Determination of the source of the variable                     
              17O/18O and exploration of applications as a quantitative measure              
              of the lifetime of CO2-H2O exchange and general mixing, e.g.                   
              stratospheric-tropospheric exchange are planned (5) High                       
              precision 18O tropospheric O2 measurements will be maintained                  
              specifically to verify 18O variations in Santa Ana conditions and              
              measure stratospheric O2 samples.
