Abstract    :
              The regulation of sister-chromatid segregation in Drosophila will              
              be analyzed.  While disjunction of sister-chromatids is common to              
              both meiosis and mitosis, in meiosis sister-chromatid separation               
              occurs in meiosis II and is inhibited in meiosis I.  Thus there are            
              functions that promote sister-chromatid cohesion as well as those              
              that lead to disjunction.  Two Drosophila mutants, mei-S332 and                
              ord, result in precocious sister-chromatid separation in meiosis               
              I of both males and females, providing a key to unraveling this                
              process.  We have recently isolated additional alleles of each of              
              these loci; these alleles reveal that the mei-S332 is not required             
              to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion until anaphase I, after the              
              kinetochore has duplicated.  The new alleles of mei-S332 will be               
              analyzed for their effects on sister-chromatid segregation in                  
              meiosis and mitosis using genetic and cytological approaches.  The             
              mei-S332 gene will be cloned and its products identified and                   
              characterized.  Since an interesting possibility is that the gene              
              encodes a component of the kinetochore which functions to maintain             
              cohesion or the two duplicated halves, the cytological location of             
              the mei-S332 gene product will be analyzed.                                    
                                                                                             
              Sister-chromatid disjunction is central to the ordered segregation             
              of chromosomes is eukaryotic organisms.  The information resulting             
              from this work will allow us to understand better fundamental                  
              aspect of inheritance.
