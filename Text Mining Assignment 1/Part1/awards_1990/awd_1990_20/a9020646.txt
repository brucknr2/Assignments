Abstract    :
              This proposal aims to generalize the Stokesian dynamics                        
              formulation of fluids with particles, with a fresh theoretical                 
              approach and several new computer strategies.  The multi-                      
              particle simulations will consider a variety of interparticle                  
              forces (Brownian, colloidal, external and hydrodynamical                       
              forces) and different length scales in the flow.                               
              Microstructural and macroscopic (rheology, diffusivity, etc.)                  
              properties will be determined under nonequilibrium flow                        
              conditions.  It is expected that Stokesian simulations of                      
              systems with tens of thousands of degrees of freedom will be                   
              possible by using sparse matrix systems and parallel                           
              processing.  This will make feasible quantitative predictions                  
              for real systems.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The proposed research will provide basic understanding for                     
              design in processing of microstructured fluids, such as                        
              composite materials, polymers, ceramics, etc.  Stokesian                       
              dynamics will be developed as a tool for other scientists and                  
              engineers.
