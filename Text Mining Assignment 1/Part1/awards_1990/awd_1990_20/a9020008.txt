Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will permit continuation of extremely productive studies            
              of X-Ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGN), dense and distant              
              clusters of galaxies, and BL Lacertae objects.  These systems                  
              possess in common the characteristic that objects selected on the              
              basis of their X-Ray emissions would not necessarily be identified             
              on the basis of their luminosity in other wavelength regions.  Dr.             
              Stocke has been one of the leading contributors to studies of these            
              systems, which appear to hold promise for increasing our                       
              understanding of such phenomena as cooling flows, evolution of                 
              galaxies, and beaming of radiation.
