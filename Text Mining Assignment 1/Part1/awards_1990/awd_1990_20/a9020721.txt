Abstract    :
                   Canisius College requests support from NSF for connection of              
              its campus network to NYSERnet.  NYSERnet is the midlevel network              
              located in the state of New York.  NYSERnet will provide                       
              operations management and information services and it will give                
              Canisius College a 19.2 thousand bits per second connection to                 
              the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)                    
              National Backbone network.                                                     
                   The College needs greater functionality and network speed to              
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
