Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is agency cross-cutting review of the national federal                    
              expenditures on materials research with special emphasis on                    
              materials synthesis and processing research.  This major effort                
              will be coordinated by NIST and cost over $300,000.  The NSF                   
              portion will be $16,800 which will be used primarily for computer              
              support.  A major report illustrating agency by agency funding                 
              will be prepared next year.
