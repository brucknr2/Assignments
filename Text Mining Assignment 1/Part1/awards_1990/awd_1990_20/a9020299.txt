Abstract    :
              The High Pressure Rapid Freezer (HPRF) will be used to freeze                  
              samples of relatively large dimensions without the formation of                
              large ice crystals, making it feasible to study complex cellular               
              systems, tissues, using rapid cryofixation.  This opens new                    
              frontiers in the exploration of rapidly fixed eukaryotic                       
              organisms.  Coupled with freeze substitution, rapid freezing will              
              allow study of labile structures, short lived events, and other                
              advances over conventional preparations already shown when single              
              cell suspensions have been studied using this approach.  Projects              
              will use the superior characteristics of freeze substituted                    
              tissues prepared with the HPRF to investigate short lived events               
              (neural tissue alterations due to ion concentrations, secretion                
              in salivary glands of ticks, secretion of calcium in plant                     
              cells), labile structures (oocyte cytoskeleton, cotton fiber                   
              cytoskeleton), osmotic-sensitive structures (mitochondria in                   
              chemotherapy, symbiotic interfaces), immunolocalization of                     
              various antigens (cytskeleton, cytokinin, anticancer agents), and              
              symbiology between dinoflagellates and sea anemone, and plants                 
              and nitrogen-fixing bacteria.  The project involves research in                
              several regional institutions, and will examine plant, animal,                 
              and microbial systems that have been recalcitrant to                           
              cryopreservation using previously available equipment.  The                    
              instrument will be the only one in the southeastern United                     
              States, and would be made available to qualified regional users.
