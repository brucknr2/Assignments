Abstract    :
              This research represents an investigation of the dynamics of                   
              electrons in disordered metals where the electrical properties are             
              determined primarily by quantum mechanical interference effects.               
              The objective is to reach an understanding of the frequency-                   
              dependent conductance in the regime where the measurement frequency            
              is greater than the quantum dephasing rate.  Disordered two- and               
              three-dimensional samples and also submicron samples.  The                     
              electrical conductance and susceptance will be measured for                    
              frequencies from dc to 20 GigaHertz, for temperatures down to 0.02             
              Kelvin, and for magnetic fields up to 10 tesla.  The sample                    
              composition and geometry will also be varied.  In addition to                  
              adding the determination of a new experimental parameter in the                
              study of quantum transport these studies are in an important regime            
              for the technology of mesoscopic systems.
