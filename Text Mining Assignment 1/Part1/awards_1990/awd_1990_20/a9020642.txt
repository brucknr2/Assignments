Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in collaboration with Peter Nabelek,               
              of the University of Missouri, will study the 160 Ma regionally                
              metamorphosed calcareous argillites in the Wildrose Canyon area                
              of the Panamint Mountains, California.  The purpose of the work                
              will be to understand the effects of fluids on the geochemistry                
              and minerals of rocks which have undergone low-pressure regional               
              prograde and retrograde metamorphism.  Principal methods to be                 
              utilized include petrographic work (and in turn phase equilibria               
              analyses), stable isotope measurements, and total major-element                
              mass  balance calculations.  The study will enhance our                        
              understanding of regional metamorphism and fluid-rock                          
              interactions at mid-crustal depths.
