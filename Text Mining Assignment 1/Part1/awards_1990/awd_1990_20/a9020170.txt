Abstract    :
              This award supports a visit by Dr. Paul W. Davenport of the                    
              University of Florida to the University of Auckland, New                       
              Zealand, to work with Dr. Paul Hill to investigate mechanisms                  
              of respiratory sensation in humans.  Respiratory sensations                    
              allow humans and animals to sense and adjust their ventilation                 
              to meet changing environmental demands.  The sensation of                      
              increased inspiratory mechanical loads has been previously                     
              studied using psychophysical techniques, but very little is                    
              known about the sensory mechanisms mediating the sensation of                  
              mechanical loads.  Recently an evoked potential technique was                  
              used to demonstrate the activation of somatosensory cortical                   
              regions by inspiratory loads.  This new respiratory related                    
              evoked potential (RREP) technique has the potential to                         
              increase our understanding of the physiological mechanisms                     
              mediating respiratory load sensation.  The researchers will use                
              inspiratory occlusions to determine the cortical generator of the              
              RREP early P1 peak.  They will standardize the stimulus/                       
              response paradigm and correlate the RREP with subjective                       
              measures of respiratory load sensation to begin the systematic                 
              investigation of the underlying physiological mechanisms.                      
              The results of these experiments will provide new information                  
              of the application of RREP's to the study of respiratory                       
              sensations.
