Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research is to clarify the relationship of               
              dental development patterns to the life histories of anthropoid                
              primates as well as increasing our knowledge of growth and                     
              development in human and non-human primates.                                   
                                                                                             
              There has been a long-standing discussion as to the maturation                 
              rates in human ancestors.  Some feel that their maturation                     
              resembled tht of modern humans; thus indicating a long period of               
              childhood dependency in our ancestors.  Others have argued                     
              against this perspective; holding that their maturation was                    
              neither human-like, nor ape-like.  The proposed research will                  
              help to resolve this debate and paint a clearer picture of the                 
              maturation pattern of earlier humans.                                          
                                                                                             
              Four specific projects will be undertaken:                                     
                   1) a comparative study of tooth emergence sequence in                     
                        anthropoids                                                          
                   2) a comparative study of tooth formation patterns in                     
                        anthropoids                                                          
                   3) development of standards for the determination of non-                 
                        human anthropoid age from dental data                                
                   4) a survey of the literature on the development of                       
                        mammalian dentition.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This basic data is of central to the ability to compare                        
              development between species.
