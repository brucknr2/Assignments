Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Steroid hormones profoundly influence the structure and function               
              of the central nervous system during development and throughout                
              the vertebrates' lifespan.  While the major source of                          
              testosterone and estradiol comes from the gonads, the brain also               
              produces steroids.  Aromatase enzymes responsible for the                      
              metabolism of androgen into estrogen are localized within                      
              specific target neurons in discrete brain regions.  Since                      
              aromatase is not found in testes or adrenals, Dr. Schlinger will               
              determine whether the major source of circulating estrogen in                  
              these males is derived from aromatization of androgens in the                  
              brain.  This has important theoretical ramifications because the               
              brain may not only be a target of steroid hormones but also a                  
              major source of a circulating steroid.  Dr. Schlinger will also                
              examine the role of brain estrogen synthesis in the regulation of              
              sex differences in brain development and function.  These studies              
              will lead to new insights in the mechanisms underlying hormone-                
              brain interactions.  Increasing our knowledge about the basic                  
              processes underlying normal neuroendocrine events will contribute              
              towards a better understanding of birth defects that result from               
              insufficient and/or excessive exposure to a particular steroid                 
              hormone.
