Abstract    :
                   A 'Polarized Collider Workshop' will bring together                       
              theoreticians/phenomenologists, experimentalists, and                          
              accelerator/machine physicists to discuss the physics case                     
              that can be made for including a polarized beam option for                     
              planned hadron colliders, and its technical feasibility.                       
              Recent technical progress in the acceleration of polarized                     
              protons (e.g. Siberian snakes) and theoretical interest in the                 
              question of the 'spin content of the proton' make the                          
              discussion of spin effects at collider and supercollider                       
              energies very topical.  The prospects for probing the physics                  
              of the standard model of the basic forces, and beyond, with                    
              polarized proton-proton collisions at collider energies must be                
              carefully assessed to provide input to any decision regarding                  
              polarization.  The need to discuss the polarization capability                 
              of future colliders must be faced soon if the problems,                        
              technical and otherwise, of including such an option are to be                 
              addressed in a timely manner.
