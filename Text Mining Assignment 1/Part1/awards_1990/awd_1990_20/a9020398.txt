Abstract    :
              In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Schlegel will develop new                    
              algorithms for reaction path following on molecular potential                  
              energy surfaces. The PI uses these computational tools to study                
              the thermodynamics and reactivity of molecules containing                      
              silicon, hydrogen and flourine that are relevant to chemical                   
              vapor deposition of amorphous silicon films for photovoltaics                  
              and etching of silicon surfaces for microelectronics.                          
                                                                                             
              A family of five new reaction path following algorithms is                     
              proposed. Previously developed spin projection methods for                     
              correlation corrections to ground state wave functions will be                 
              extended and spin projections will be developed for CI singles                 
              calculations (single substitutions in the ground state                         
              determinantal function) of excited states. A new transition                    
              structure optimization algorithm  and a new type of electric                   
              field dependent basis to calculate improved dipole moments,                    
              polarizability and infrared intensities will be developed. In                  
              the area of applications the mechanism of simple photochemical                 
              reactions will be explored. Reaction path following will be                    
              used to study the effect of solvent molecules on transition                    
              states for SN2 reactions. Transition structures and barrier                    
              heights will be determined for radical abstractions, radical                   
              additions to multiple bonds and diradical cycloaddition                        
              reactions. The study of the thermal decomposition of silicon                   
              compounds will be continued.
