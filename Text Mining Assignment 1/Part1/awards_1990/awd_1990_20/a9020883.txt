Abstract    :
              This multi-disciplinary exploratory research work involves sensor              
              design and signal processing in magnetic recording systems.  It                
              involves the use of multi-sensor head structures (which is                     
              different from multi-track structures) along a track, signal                   
              processing techniques applied to these multi-sensor signals to                 
              increase the signal to noise ratio and hence the clarity of                    
              magnetic recording and characterization/analysis of track edge                 
              noise.  Also, the multi-sensor data are used to implement a high               
              resolution, continuously monitored track-edge following servo                  
              system for very high density application.  This would free up the              
              5%-30% of track width that is being used to store information for              
              present embedded servoing methods and hence increase the recording             
              density.
