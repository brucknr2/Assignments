Abstract    :
                   Despite numerous systematic studies, the relationships among              
              many species within the dog family Canidae remain unresolved.                  
              Two areas of continued disagreement are the wolf-like species (in              
              the genera Canis, Cuon,Lycaon, and Speothos) and the South                     
              American species (in 5-7 genera).  Together the two groups                     
              include some 20 species, or more than half of those within the                 
              family Canidae.  Previous work based on morphology, allozyme                   
              variation, and karyology have failed to provide a consistent                   
              picture of relationships among these taxa.  In large part, the                 
              lack of success of the molecular analyses was due to the close                 
              relationships among many of these species.  Associations among                 
              such closely related taxa are best studied with more fine-scale                
              molecular analyses, such as those based on mitochondrial DNA                   
              sequence data.  Here, it is proposed to test several specific                  
              hypotheses concerning the systematics of these taxa using                      
              phylogenetic analysis of approximately 850 base pairs of                       
              mitochondrial DNA sequence obtained by polymerase chain                        
              amplification (PCR) of genomic DNA.  Because the mitochondrial                 
              DNA sequence of mammals evolves quickly (5-10 times faster than                
              the average nuclear sequence), it is particularly appropriate for              
              the study of closely related species.  Many of these canid                     
              species have been the focus of comparative studies of carnivore                
              behavior and thus resolution of their relationships will                       
              illuminate the potential effects of ancestry on observed                       
              patterns.
