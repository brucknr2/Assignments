Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will take advantage of unique aspects of the                      
              hypothalamic-pituitary system in a common species of turtle                    
              (Pseudemys scripta) and frog (Rana pipiens) to study the dynamic               
              relationship between brain peptide regulation of pituitary                     
              function and its modulation by peripheral feedback in relation to              
              gonadal and thyroidal function.  The turtle pituitary model will               
              be used to study responsiveness of TSH secretion and                           
              environmental regulation of TSH secretion with emphasis on plasma              
              binding proteins.  Thyroxine binding protein will be purified and              
              characterized for studies on its physiological role in the                     
              regulation of thyroid hormone transport and function in hopes of               
              developing a model for understanding the evolution and function                
              of thyroxine binding globulins.  The demonstrated resistance of                
              the frog pituitary to desensitization by gonadotropin-releasing                
              hormone (GnRH) will be exploited to study the action of this                   
              neuropeptide on gonadotropin biosynthesis and its modulation by                
              steroids.  Parallel measurements of GnFH in the hypothalamus                   
              willl seek to determine how steroids influence pituitary                       
              regulation by actions in the brain.//
