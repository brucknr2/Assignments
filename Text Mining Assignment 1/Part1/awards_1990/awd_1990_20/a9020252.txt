Abstract    :
              This is a joint research effort between Clemson University                     
              (Dr. Juang) and University of Washington (Dr. Holtz) to                        
              develop a new procedure for  an "intelligent" and                              
              systematic processing of geotechnical information generated                    
              from in situ tests for determination of design parameters.                     
              Methods developed in Artificial Intelligence and Operations                    
              Research, knowledge-based systems, and fuzzy set theory                        
              will be utilized for dealing with incomplete and uncertain                     
              data and information
