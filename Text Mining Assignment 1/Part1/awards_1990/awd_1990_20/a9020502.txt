Abstract    :
              Bacteria can stick to both living and inanimate surfaces                       
              where they can produce copious amounts of an extracellular                     
              polymeric material.  This material forms a polymer gel                         
              matrix termed a biofilm.  The Principal Investigator (PI)                      
              proposes to develop a better understanding of the                              
              mechanisms that govern biofilm formation, persistence, and                     
              performance.  This will include the determination of the                       
              characteristics of the polymer gel matrix as a function of                     
              bacterial species and prevailing growth conditions, and                        
              the assessment of the biofilm extracellular polymer gel                        
              matrix in the mass transport of specific macromolecules                        
              (e.g. antibiotics, bacterially-produced pigments,                              
              chromosomal- and plasmid-DNA).
