Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study concentrates on high resolution electron microscopy(TEM)            
              of compound semiconductor films for increased understanding of the             
              relationships between atomic level structural characteristics,                 
              electrical and optical properties, and details of advanced                     
              materials synthesis and processing methods.  Additionally, it is               
              anticipated that these research efforts will provide a basis for               
              relating observed microscopic features to subsequent optical and               
              electronic device performance.
