Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports analytical and numerical investigations into               
              the topology of the large scale structure of the universe by one               
              of the leading groups of cosmologists in the world.  Computer                  
              algorithms developed to measure the topology of volume                         
              distributions of galaxies, sky maps, and pencils beam surveys will             
              be applied to new observational surveys as well as to very large               
              scale numerical simulations.   These studies are designed to help              
              understand the nature of large scale structure and the initial                 
              conditions that produced it.
