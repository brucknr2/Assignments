Abstract    :
                   This award enables Indiana State University to connect to                 
              NSFNET through a 56,000 bit per second link to the University of               
              Indiana.  The link to Indiana connects Indiana State to the mid-               
              level network CICnet, which then connects to NSFNET.                           
                   Access to NSFNET provides the faculty and students with                   
              access to supercomputers, data archives, a variety of network                  
              gateways, automated library catalogs, and a wide range of                      
              software.  Primary applications include file transfers,                        
              electronic mail communication between local and remote                         
              researchers, and remote login to and use of supercomputers and                 
              other research facilities.
