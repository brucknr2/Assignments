Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project are to examine the role of                  
              biotic interactions in a Chilean small mammal assemblage.                      
              Predation, plant-small mammal interactions, and interspecific                  
              competition are being studied with experimental exclusions of                  
              predators, and the most abundant small mammal herbivore, the degu              
              rat, from fenced exclosures.  Small mammal populations will be                 
              censused monthly, and predator diets and activity monitored by                 
              scat/pellet collections and analysis, and olfactory lines and                  
              call playbacks.  Plant community changes are followed with point               
              intercept sampling each 4 months, and monthly sampling during the              
              annual growing season; soil samples every 4 months track seed                  
              densities.  Similar initial conditions were present, and few                   
              changes in plant species cover, composition or seed densities                  
              have occurred since experiment initiation in May 1989.  Numbers                
              of degus in predator exclusion plots were higher during spring                 
              (September-November 1989): survival times and rates were                       
              significantly higher throughout the year.  Responses of other                  
              small mammal species to predator/degu exclusions have been mixed.              
              Continued support is requested for three years since changes in                
              the small mammal assemblage and plant community are likely to be               
              long-term.  This large scale project represents the first long-                
              term study of biotic interactions in a temperate Neotropical                   
              vertebrate assemblage.
