Abstract    :
              This award supports a study to determine the mass balance                      
              and mechanics of ice flow in the Siple Coast region of West                    
              Antarctica.  The work is aimed at refining the mass balance                    
              calculation for ice stream B and allowing the first accurate                   
              calculations of the mass balance of ice streams D and E. The                   
              flow mechanics of the ice streams will be studied using                        
              strain grids, which allow the side drag, longitudinal                          
              tension and basal friction to be determined.  Limited strain                   
              and topographic grids observed on Spot-satellite imagery.                      
              This work will document the current physical state of the                      
              Ross Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and                            
              contribute to the understanding of the cause of the                            
              extremely rapid drainage of the ice sheet through large ice                    
              streams.
