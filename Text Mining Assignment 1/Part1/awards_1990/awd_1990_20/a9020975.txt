Abstract    :
              This award supports a detailed geological investigation of the                 
              Sirius Formation, Antarctica, in order to determine: 1) its                    
              relation to alpine glaciers and ice sheets; 2) its age and                     
              stratigraphy; and 3) the source of the enclosed marine                         
              microfossils.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The results of this research will provide a critical test for the              
              leading hypotheses of the origin of the Sirius Formation and,                  
              thereby, contribute significantly to resolving Antarctic Ice                   
              Sheet response to Tertiary climate warmth.  Given the important                
              role that the Antarctic Ice Sheet plays in global climate, this                
              new knowledge will significantly aid resolution of global-scale                
              paleoclimate problems, principally by constraining interpretation              
              of the deep sea oxygen-isotope record.  This data will also                    
              permit the testing and tuning of ice sheet models.
