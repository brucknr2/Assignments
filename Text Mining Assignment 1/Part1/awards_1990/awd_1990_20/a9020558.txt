Abstract    :
              This award supports a visit by Professors Michael Stob of                      
              Calvin College, Steffen Lempp of the University of Wisconsin,                  
              and Richard Shore of Cornell University, to Victoria                           
              University, New Zealand, to work with Professor Rodney Downey.                 
              All have collaborated successfully in the past and have several                
              on-going projects in recursion theory, a branch of mathematical                
              logic.  All concern the study of certain algebraic structures                  
              which arise naturally from the study of effective                              
              computability.  The primary structures they will study are the                 
              lattice of recursively enumerable sets and the                                 
              uppersemilattices of the Turing degrees and the recursively                    
              enumerable Turing degrees.  The principal method they will                     
              employ is the priority method.
