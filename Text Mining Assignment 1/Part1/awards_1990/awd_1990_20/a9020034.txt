Abstract    :
                   The evolutionary transition from reptiles to mammals took                 
              place during the Triassic Period, and higher vertebrate fossils                
              of this age are studied intensively.  Dr. A.W. Crompton has the                
              unprecedented opportunity to study Triassic fossils of early                   
              mammals and mammal-like reptiles from the People's Republic of                 
              China.  The specimens will be taken on loan to Harvard University              
              where closely-spaced sections through the skulls will be cut and               
              recorded on a computer-based image analysis system.  The                       
              sections will be integrated by the computer into a three-                      
              dimensional reconstruction, revealing new morphological features               
              of the cranial interiors.                                                      
                   The data to be gathered during this study will have direct                
              impact on the several competing hypotheses that seek to explain                
              the origin (or origins) of mammals from reptiles.  Evolutionary                
              biologist, vertebrate anatomists, and paleontologists will find                
              the results of this study of interest.  The project will also                  
              improve scientific collaboration and exchange between the U.S.                 
              and China.
