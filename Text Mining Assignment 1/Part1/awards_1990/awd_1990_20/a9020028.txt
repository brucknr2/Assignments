Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for a project to study                     
              chemical oxidation processes for the destruction of                            
              organic contaminants of water.  The project involves                           
              systematic investigation of oxidation processes that                           
              involve the use of ozone, hydrogen peroxide and                                
              ultraviolet radiation.  The investigator plans to address                      
              the fundamental principles that are involved in these                          
              oxidation processes, characterize the rate at which they                       
              occur and determine the reaction mechanisms.  She will use                     
              the results of these studies to construct mathematical                         
              models that can be utilized in engineering design of                           
              decontamination processes for water and for treatment of                       
              wastewaters.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Ozone, hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet radiation have                        
              been applied to treatment of water and wastewater without                      
              clear understanding of the chemical and physical                               
              mechanisms that are involved in their action on organic                        
              compounds.  This project is expected to provide insights                       
              into those processes that will permit better design of                         
              processes and systems than is now possible.
