Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Iowa State University established a UNIDATA system using                  
              State funds.  The system will be enhanced under this award.                    
              UNIDATA plays an important role in the teaching and research                   
              programs for both the atmospheric science and agricultural                     
              meteorology programs.  For example, the jointly taught                         
              Introduction to Meteorology course with a yearly enrollment in                 
              excess of 800 students uses McIDAS products in the weather                     
              discussion which begins each lecture.  Several research projects               
              depend upon "real-time" data input including a project which uses              
              upper-air data, radar observations and satellite imagery in an                 
              operational forecast mode to predict insect pest movements in the              
              boundary layer.                                                                
                   The equipment to be acquired will accomplish five main                    
              objectives:  1. Update the four IBM PS/2 model 60 computers with               
              three IBM PS/2 model 70 computers.  This will allow Iowa State                 
              University to continue receiving McIDAS weather products after                 
              the UNIDATA support for the DOS  version of PC-McIDAS terminates;              
              2. Obtain networking software (TCP/2) for the OS/2 operating                   
              system for the IBM PS/2 model 80 (which will act as the                        
              ingester) and the four model 70's; 3. Obtain PC X-Window                       
              software to use with the existing IBM PS/2 model 60 computers as               
              X-Window systems.  An existing Sun 3/160 which now manages                     
              UNIDATA SDM will act as the X-Window server; 4. Add a 700                      
              megabyte hard disk unit to improve the ability to archive McIDAS               
              and SDM products; 5. Initiate the introduction of COMET computer               
              based learning models as an educational resource for                           
              undergraduate and graduate instruction at the university and to                
              foster synergism between the UNIDATA and COMET Programs.
