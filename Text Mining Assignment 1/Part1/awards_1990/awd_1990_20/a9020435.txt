              advance the state-of-the-art of autonomous                                     
              underwater vehicles, and second, to develop                                    
              technologies needed by geologists to                                           
              facilitate automatic reentry of deep-sea                                       
              boreholes so that new exploratory,                                             
              experimental tools may be deployed
