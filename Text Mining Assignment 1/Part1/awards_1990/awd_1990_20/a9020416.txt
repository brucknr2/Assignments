Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The work will provide a workload characterization based on                     
              categorization of major job classes, rates at which the job mix                
              parameters change, composition of queues as a function of job size             
              and CPU limits, and a correlation between resource demands and                 
              application algorithms.  The goals are to minimize the wall clock              
              expansion factor through optimal queue control, minimize idle time by          
              keeping the appropriate job mix in real memory, and process large              
              resource demanding jobs in the general mix, without penalizing all             
              processes, including the largest ones.
