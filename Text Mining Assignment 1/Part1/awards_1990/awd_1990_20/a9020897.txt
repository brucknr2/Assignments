Abstract    :
                   Large space structures will become very important in the                  
              future of manned and unmanned space flight. Types of large space               
              structures include frameworks of solar panels, space stations, and             
              probably the manned interplanetary spacecraft.                                 
              %%%                                                                            
                   The purpose of the proposed research is to study the different            
              forces (e.g gravitational) and stresses (e.g thermal, vibrational)             
              exerted on these large space structures. One goal of this project              
              is to develop three-dimensional computer simulations of forces and             
              stresses acting on a frame. Also, it is planned to create scale                
              models to determine the maximum load the frames can withstand for              
              a particular set of material.
