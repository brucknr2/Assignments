Abstract    :
                   The PIs propose to conduct a detailed study of the                        
              electronic and vibrational structure of O3 by angle-resolved                   
              electron scattering spectroscopy.  They assert that the                        
              electronic states must be better characterized in order to begin               
              a proper assessment of the role of ozone in the chemistry,                     
              radiative transfer, and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium                    
              (non-LTE) effects in the terrestrial atmosphere.  The PIs plan to              
              reproduce the 15-yr-old electron energy loss spectra of Swanson                
              and Celotta, with improved sensitivity, energy resolution, and                 
              angular coverage, and to extend the measurements to include                    
              determinations of electronic and vibrational excitation cross                  
              sections.  The Swanson and Celotta result, though pioneering, is               
              marginal in sensitivity and definitive feature assignments;                    
              however it remains the only tangible experimental evidence for                 
              the energetics of the controversial low-lying metastable states                
              of ozone.  The premise is that these states may participate in                 
              the O + O2 recombination sequence, and thus could be significant               
              energy carriers in the photochemistry of O3 in the stratosphere,               
              mesosphere, and thermosphere.
