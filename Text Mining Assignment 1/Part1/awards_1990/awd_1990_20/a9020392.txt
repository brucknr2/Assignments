Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses the urgent issues of non-renewable resource            
              development in Arctic regions of the United States and the USSR.               
              A comparative evaluation of national regimes will be used to help              
              consolidate the interests of government, industry, environmental               
              organizations and Native communities.  Funding is requested for                
              five U.S. participants to meet with Soviet colleagues in Moscow in             
              late Fall 1990 under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of                     
              Sciences.  The international and multidisciplinary focus of this               
              proposal coincides very well with the goals of the Arctic Social               
              Science program within the Division of Polar Programs and the                  
              international goals of the Arctic Research and Policy Act.
