Abstract    :
              This is a project the objective of which is to assess the                      
              current status of environmental biotechnology with                             
              particular reference to technical and environmental issues                     
              involved in the development of biodegradable plastics.  It                     
              will involve assessment of the "state-of-the-                                  
              science/engineering" associated with biodegradation,                           
              photodegradation and recycling of plastics.  The project                       
              will involve interviews with academic researchers, persons                     
              associated with the plastics industry, and governmental                        
              agencies concerned with the use and regulation of                              
              technologies involved in the management of waste plastics.                     
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              Results of this project are expect to provide a basis for                      
              determination of future research needs.  The three                             
              undergraduate students who will be working on this project                     
              are Emin Abufele, Jodi Pisinski and Christ Sparages.                           
              Faculty advisors in addition to the Principal Investigator                     
              include WPI Professors Rollings and Ljungquist.  This                          
              project is jointly supported by the Environmental Systems                      
              component of the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program                       
              and by the Biotechnology Program in the Division of                            
              Biological and Critical Systems.
