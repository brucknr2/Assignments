Abstract    :
                   This research is aimed at investigating the applicability of              
              magnetic resonance imaging techniques to resolve micron sized                  
              surface flaws produced in ceramics materials during the finishing              
              operation of diamond grinding.  Flaws in the size range from 5-20              
              microns are currently not resolvable by existing nondestructive                
              methods.  The impact of this research, if successful, could be the             
              development of a quality assurance method for use in the production            
              of mechanically reliable ceramic components, as well as a useful               
              characterization tool for gaining better fundamental understanding             
              of ceramic grinding processes.
