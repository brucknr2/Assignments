Abstract    :
              A collaborative project is proposed to produce illustrated keys to             
              enable identification of all genera of Chalcidoidea (a large group             
              of parasitic wasps) known from North America including temperate               
              areas of Mexico.  The Chalcidoidea are one of the largest groups               
              of wasps, containing about 16,000 described species.  Because all              
              species are parasites of other insects, they are of great                      
              importance to agriculture as natural enemies of insect pests and               
              of fundamental importance in ecological systems as regulators of               
              plant-feeding insects.  However, adequate keys to identify genera              
              presently do not exist for most of the twenty families present in              
              the region.  Seventeen scientists have made formal commitments to              
              participate in this project and each family is covered by one or               
              more contributors.  Agreements on scope, content and format of the             
              project was reached at a workshop held in 1989.  The approach will             
              be a pragmatic synthesis of available information using current                
              concepts of genera and higher taxa (families and subfamilies).                 
              The output will be a single manual.  Introductory chapters will                
              include a key to chalcidoid families and a section on anatomical               
              terms explaining the uniform terminology to be used throughout the             
              manual.  The keys will use an annotated format to provide                      
              information on distributions, numbers of species, and hosts when               
              practical for each genus.  A second planning workshop is proposed              
              for integration of the chapters and hands-on testing of draft keys             
              by all participants.  The resulting manual will enable many                    
              biologists to identify Neartic chalcidoids to genus and will vastly            
              facilitate this task for systematics.
