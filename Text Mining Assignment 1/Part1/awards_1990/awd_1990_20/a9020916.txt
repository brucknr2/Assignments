Abstract    :
                   The theme of the Trent Homotopy Conference is the interplay               
              between a space and its loop space under certain finiteness                    
              conditions.  There are several lines of inquiry related to this                
              theme which are of current interest and in which major                         
              contributions have recently been made.                                         
                   This grant will help defray expenses for American researchers             
              in this area to attend this conference to be held June 9-15, 1991              
              in Ontario, Canada.  Established experts in the various areas will             
              be brought together, along with younger researchers and some                   
              students, to foster beneficial exchanges of ideas, problems and                
              techniques.
