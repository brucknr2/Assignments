Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the research of a team of cultural                         
              anthropologists, biologists, and remote sensing experts to study               
              the sociocultural and environmental change in tropical forests of              
              Papua New Guinea.  The project will develop a database of                      
              geographic images of a highland area occupied by indigenous                    
              farmers.  Using ground surveys of agricultural activities and of               
              tree forms along with remote sensing images, the investigators                 
              will try to explain the patterns of stability and change in the                
              tropical forest as an interaction of indigenous farming                        
              activities and ecological processes that do not involve humans.                
                                                                                             
              This projects is important because understanding the interaction               
              of human and non-human processes in the change and stability of                
              tropical forests is critical if the biological resources                       
              represented in these tropical forest areas are to be conserved.
