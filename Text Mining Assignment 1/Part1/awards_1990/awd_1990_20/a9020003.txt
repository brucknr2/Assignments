Abstract    :
                   Root systems of trees and lianas native to north-central                  
              Florida will be compared on the basis of morphology, maximum                   
              depth, and efficiency of colonization of resource-rich volumes of              
              soil.  Allometrical studies of lianas and trees will elucidate                 
              differences in the following ratios:  roots:shoot biomass; leaf                
              area:root surface area; leaf area:stem cross sectional area; and,              
              root:root biomass.  Additionally the P.I. will determine the                   
              degree to which dense tangles of lianas suppress tree seedling                 
              growth through competition belowground and aboveground.  Liana                 
              roots, like their stems, do not serve a mechanical support                     
              function and thus belowground biomass can be allocated to                      
              maximize the volume of soil explored for water and nutrients.                  
              Liana root systems are expected to be extremely opportunistic in               
              distribution and thus benefit more frequently than tree roots                  
              from spatial and temporal variation in water and nutrient                      
              availability.  Differences between trees and lianas in root                    
              foraging efficiency will be experimentally determined.
