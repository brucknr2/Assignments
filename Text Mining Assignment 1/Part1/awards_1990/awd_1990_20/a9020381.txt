Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This project is a study of galactic-scale "superwinds" - mass                  
              outflows driven by the collective effect of supernovae and winds               
              from massive stars.  Observational evidence for this phenomena                 
              has only recently been uncovered, and the importance of this                   
              effect for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies               
              and the inter-galactic medium is very large.  Dr. Heckman, one of              
              the leaders in the study of active galactic nuclei, will utilize               
              both long-slit optical spectroscopy and H-alpha imaging to                     
              directly test a number of ideas related to these superwinds.
