Abstract    :
              Several types of gelatinous zooplankton, including medusae,                    
              sometimes occur in extremely high numbers (blooms).  The                       
              reasons for dramatic population fluctuations are not                           
              understood.  The scyphomedusa Chrysaora quinquecirrha is                       
              unusual in thriving in estuarine waters of as little as 7%                     
              salinity.  However, its annual population fluctuations may be                  
              related to differences in springtime conditions during asexual                 
              production of medusae in the spring.  This research is                         
              designed to test the combined effects of temperature, salinity,                
              and food levels on the production and survival of young                        
              medusae.  Drs. Purcell and Wright will examine ionic and osmotic               
              regulation in the polyps and medusae in order to determine if                  
              they are physiologically limited in low salinities.  This project              
              is an effort to understand population fluctuations of a major                  
              predator in Chesapeake Bay.  The results are important in                      
              understanding the formation of blooms in pelagic ecosystems.                   
              Responses of bloom organisms to changing environmental                         
              conditions are of particular importance now, given the                         
              predicted temperature and salinity changes associated with                     
              global warming.
