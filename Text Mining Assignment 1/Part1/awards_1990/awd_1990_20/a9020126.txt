Abstract    :
                   The study of heavy metal tolerance has provided one of the                
              most sources of data for understanding the processes of adaptation             
              and natural selection.  Jonathan Shaw was one of the primary                   
              players in the indepth exploration of this phenomenon among the                
              mosses.  The proposed research is a continuation of his interest               
              in this group of organisms and this phenomenon, and it will extend             
              that work to the study of patterns of evolution in the entire                  
              subfamily.  The proposal will incorporate undergraduate students               
              into the full scope of the research and provide them with valuable             
              experience in planning and conducting a detailed and complete                  
              inquiry.  Among the questions to be considered is the degree of                
              genetic diversification among widely scattered populations of                  
              copper-mosses that are morphologically very similar.
