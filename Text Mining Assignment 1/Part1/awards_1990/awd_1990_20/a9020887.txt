Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis                       
              (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, is an international institution                 
              that, according to its charter, conducts pure and applied                      
              research in systems analysis, "in relation to problems of                      
              modern societies arising from scientific and technological                     
              development."  The institute is governed by a council                          
              comprised of representatives from 15 National Member                           
              Organizations, including the United States, the Soviet Union,                  
              Canada, Japan, and several Western and Eastern European                        
              countries.  In December 1989, the President determined that                    
              IIASA conducts useful research and merits U.S. support.                        
              Currently, its major research is focused in four policy                        
              relevant areas:  (1) the Envirnomental and Climate and                         
              Ecology-Related Program; (2) Population Program; (3)                           
              Technology, Economy and Society Program; and (4) System and                    
              Decision Science Program.  This grant will support research                    
              in all four areas.  Many of the specific issues addressed by                   
              IIASA's research, particularly in the first of these broad                     
              program areas, is closely related to Global Climate Change                     
              problems.  In view of its long-standing ties with scientists                   
              in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, IIASA is in a                          
              particularly good position to explore environmentally-related                  
              problems in that region of Europe, including their likely long-                
              term conseqences for Western Europe.
