Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are threefold: (1) to use cladistic            
              data to delimit areas of endemism in and reconstruct the                       
              biogeographic history of the cool-temperate afromontane rain forest            
              biota in Africa and Madagascar; (2) to revise and provide cladistic            
              analyses for several spider taxa occurring in Africa and Madagascar            
              likely to contribute to (1), and (3) to contribute to the higher               
              classification of the spider superfamilies Araneoidea, Lycosoidea,             
              and Migoidea.  The resulting area cladogram will provide                       
              information bearing upon several hypotheses regarding the age and              
              mode of origin of patterns within the forest biota in Africa and               
              Madagascar.  Funding is requested for personnel, equipment, and                
              travel necessary to complete revisionary studies on the                        
              Cyatholipidae, Zoropsidae, Migidae, Microstigmatidae, Amaurobiidae             
              Phyxelidinae, and Orsolobidae.  The revisions will be based upon               
              material already in museums as well as that acquired on collecting             
              trips to Cameroon, Madagascar, and Tanzania.
