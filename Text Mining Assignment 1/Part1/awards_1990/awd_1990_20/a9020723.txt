Abstract    :
                   This project will purchase computer equipment to enhance                  
              research and educational activities using UNIDATA developed                    
              technologies within the Department of Meteorology (DoM) at the                 
              SDSM&T.  Two Sun Sparcstation IPC with additional memory, disk                 
              capacity (on one unit) and input/output capabilities will be                   
              purchased.  The UNIDATA suite of software will allow the                       
              Department to ingest, analyze, and interactively display of                    
              weather data for the purposes of research and instruction.  In                 
              addition to enhancing the Department's capabilities, the requested             
              hardware and software will enable transition from an existing                  
              VMS-based to a UNIX-based system.  This transition is important                
              since UNIDATA will no longer support or continue to develop its                
              software for the VMS operating system.  SDSM&T is presently not                
              part of the UNIDATA community and their participation will be                  
              mutually beneficial to the SDSM&T and the UNIDATA community.
