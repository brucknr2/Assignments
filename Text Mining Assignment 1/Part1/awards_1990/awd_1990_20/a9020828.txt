Abstract    :
              The research supported by this grant will concentrate on                       
              determining the mechanism of cavity nucleation, growth and linkage             
              in superplastic metals. Quantitative metallography will be used to             
              evaluate the effects of temperature, strain rate, and grain size.              
              The results will contribute to the understanding the limits of                 
              superplastic deformation in such applications as high strain sheet             
              metal forming.
