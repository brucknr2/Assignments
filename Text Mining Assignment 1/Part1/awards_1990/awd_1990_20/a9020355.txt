Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Laboratory flames of H2/CO/O2/N2 will be studied over a range                  
              of stoichiometries seeded with sulfur and sodium species to                    
              determine the nature of the chemistry controlling the                          
              formation of deposits of sodium sulfate and carbonate on                       
              cooled substrate materials.  With measurements of temperature                  
              using Na-D reversal, atomic Na and OH profiles using LIF, and                  
              the surface deposit composition using in-situ Raman                            
              scattering, a kinetic model for the deposition process can be                  
              developed.  Effects of substrate material and temperature, and                 
                                                                                             
              the composition of the gas phase species will be determined.                   
              In particular, the reversibility of the Na2SO4 and Na2CO3                      
              layer                                                                          
              build-up will be examined as a function of flame conditions.                   
                                                                                             
              This program will resolve the nature of the chemistry                          
              controlling the formation of deposits of sodium sulfate and                    
              carbonate from flames on cooled substrates.  It will establish                 
                                                                                             
              which species in the gas phase are involved in the                             
              heterogeneous surface production of these salts.  Such                         
              knowledge will be needed to develop combustion modification                    
              strategies to minimize high temperature corrosion and                          
              deposition in sulfur and sodium containing systems.
