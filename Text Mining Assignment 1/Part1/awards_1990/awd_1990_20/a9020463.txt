Abstract    :
              This award will support the purchase of the 570-node Intel Delta               
              Touchstone System.  This will be the world's fastest computer.                 
              The computer will be housed on the California Institute of                     
              Technology's campus, but has been acquired through the Concurrent              
              Supercomputing Consortium.  There are 14 members of the                        
              consortium, ranging from federal agencies, government labs,                    
              universities and Intel.  The immediate benefit of the use of this              
              machine will be to solve problems in areas of neurobiology,                    
              chemical physics, fluid dynamics and astrophysics.  The                        
              researchers will attack problems in these and other areas that                 
              could not be approached with existing computers.  The science, in              
              this research, is driving the development of computational                     
              hardware and software.  Experience gained by this set of                       
              researchers on this machine will demonstrate the use of parallel               
              supercomputers to the nation's scientists.  Further, it will help              
              in developing new parallel architectures.
