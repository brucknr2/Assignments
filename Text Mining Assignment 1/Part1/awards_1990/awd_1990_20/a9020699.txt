Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports a linguistic anthropologist who will                     
              identify and explain cross-language patterns in ways Native                    
              American languages have named new objects or concepts encountered              
              in contact situations.  At least 100 Indians languages will be                 
              surveyed for words of 50 items of Occidental culture (e.g.,                    
              chair, cow, week, clock).  Such words are either loanwoards                    
              (e.g., from Spanish into Indian languages) or manufactured from                
              native vocabulary.  The hypothesis is that languages that are                  
              heavy adopters of loans for these items have histories involving               
              significant bilingualism, while languages that show considerable               
              use of native terms do not have such histories.                                
                                                                                             
              This research is important because understanding of how languages              
              adopt new concepts and words for new objects advances our basic                
              understanding of language as a human element.
