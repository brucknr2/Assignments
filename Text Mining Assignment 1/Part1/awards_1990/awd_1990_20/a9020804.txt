Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Jensen will                
              study metal ion catalyzed reactions of organic substances with                 
              water as a means to determine the reactive behavior of metal                   
              ions in various states of complexation. Metal ions play a vital                
              role in the chemical processes essential to our quality of                     
              life, both from an industrial/economic viewpoint as well as                    
              from a biological perspective. Information gained via                          
              exploration of the dependence of metal ion reactivity on the                   
              state of metal complexation is expected to have application to                 
              environmental problems (e.g., problems related to                              
              detoxification of organomercurials in the environment) and to                  
              the development of new chemical transformations.                               
                                                                                             
              It has been shown that the ability of mercury(II) ions to                      
              promote hydrolysis of O,S-acetals is greatly diminished when                   
              the reaction is performed in the presence of anions that are                   
              capable of complexing this ion. The project seeks to clarify                   
              the role of the heavy metal ion in such reactions, i.e., does                  
              the metal simply function as a Lewis acid, or does the reaction                
              with, e.g., O,S-acetals involve oxidation of sulfur via                        
              electron transfer to the heavy metal ion? The effect of                        
              changing the hydrolysis-promoting reagent from a Lewis acid                    
              reagent to an electron transfer reagent will be probed via                     
              kinetic studies that involve high oxidation state                              
              metallocomplexes of a variety of transition metals. Fast                       
              reaction kinetic (i.e., stopped-flow) techniques will be                       
              utilized to detect build-up of oxidized sulfur species that is                 
              postulated to occur prior to decomposition of the O,S-acetal in                
              electron transfer mediated processes.
