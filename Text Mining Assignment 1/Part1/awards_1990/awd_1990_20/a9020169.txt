Abstract    :
              This grant will allow the School of Engineering at North Carolina              
              A&T State University to develop and implement a strategic plan.                
              The development and implementation of this plan will provide the               
              School with a systematic process for making risk taking decisions              
              in implementing quality programs for meeting the demands of its                
              students, faculty, and community.  Further, the plan will provide              
              the philosophy and strategy for meeting specific goals to assure               
              the growth, health, and vitality of the School to survive in the               
              21st century.
