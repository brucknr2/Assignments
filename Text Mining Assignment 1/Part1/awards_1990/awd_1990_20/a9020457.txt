Abstract    :
                   A detailed study of the angular distrbutions of                           
              photoelectrons following two-step laser ionization of                          
              molecular systems will be made. Both direct ionization and                     
              autoionization via an intermediate state will be studied. An                   
              important aspect of the work is that the angle between the                     
              polarization vectors of the lasers may be varied, and theory                   
              predicts that when these are not parallel there will be a                      
              breakdown of  cylindrical symmetry, which may be verified by                   
              this type of measurement.  During the later stages of the work                 
              the polarization of the ejected electrons as well as their                     
              angular distribution will be measured.
