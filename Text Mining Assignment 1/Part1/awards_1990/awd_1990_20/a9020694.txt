Abstract    :
                   Tuskegee University request support from NSF for connection               
              of their campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel                   
              network located in the southeastern United States.  It will                    
              provide operations management and information services and it                  
              will give  Tuskegee University a 56 thousand bits per second                   
              connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per              
              second) National Backbone network.                                             
                   The University needs greater functionality and network speed              
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
