Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Drs. Field, Chapin and Mooney will conduct integrated studies of               
              the responses of California annual grassland to altered resource               
              balance, focusing on factors controlling the response of the                   
              ecosystem to elevated CO2.  Their research involves coordinated                
              empirical and modeling programs to test a series of hypotheses that            
              potentially account for the mechanisms and feedbacks governing                 
              system-level behavior of aboveground and belowground production,               
              decomposition, and nutrient cycling in response to altered                     
              resources.  The conceptual model for the system-level effects  of              
              elevated CO2 is based on two hypotheses concerning the mechanisms              
              of the system level responses and the loci of the direct effects.              
              First, they hypothesize that elevated CO2 may generate novel                   
              resource balance, but the response of plant growth can be                      
              understood and predicted from responses of other variations in                 
              resource balance that change the availability of carbon, relative              
              to other resources.  Second, they hypothesize that system-level                
              responses to elevated CO2 are driven primarily through direct                  
              effects on plants.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This research program consists of five components: 1) a study of               
              the responses of natural ecosystems to elevated CO2 in open top                
              chambers.  2) a probe of ecosystem responses to a range of                     
              modifications, including elevated CO2, altered nutrient and water              
              availability, and altered species composition, using artificial                
              microecosystems in open top chambers.  3) a study of controls on               
              decomposition and nutrient cycling with laboratory, field and                  
              microecosystem experiments using plant litter from the other                   
              experiments as well as isotopic tracers.  4) an exploration of the             
              resource effects on plant growth, allocation, and tissue chemistry             
              with a series of greenhouse experiments.  5) a modeling effort to              
              integrate the experimental results and to link and extend existing             
              ecosystem, community, and plant models.                                        
                                                                                             
              This program has the potential to advance several aspects of our               
              understanding of system-level responses to global climate change.              
              First, studies with elevated CO2 in the California annual grassland            
              will complement CO2 studies in other grasslands, with results from             
              a system that is unique in terms of low carbon storage and rapid               
              equilibration.  Second, the small stature of the plants, combined              
              with the small time constant for system equilibration, will allow              
              the investigators to explore consequences of a broad range of                  
              resource availabilities and plant species characteristics.                     
              Finally, the emphasis on mechanisms of system-level responses,                 
              integrated through linked models, should make the results of this              
              study generalizable to other ecosystems.
