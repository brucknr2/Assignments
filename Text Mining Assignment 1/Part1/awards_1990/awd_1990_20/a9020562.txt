Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this proposal is to quantify variation                
              in the anatomy of the head and jaw of four, closely related                    
              species within a subfamily of New World monkeys, the Atelinae.                 
              Currently there are a number of diverse approaches by which                    
              quantification of the morphology of complex structures has been                
              attempted.  Each has a number of advantages and disadvantages.                 
              The PIs will utilize several of these in order to provide data                 
              which can then be used to explain cranial variation within these               
              monkeys.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Hypotheses related to function, such as the role of dietary                    
              adaptations, will be tested to clarify the role of developmental               
              factors in the production of variation.  The results should help               
              to clarify the forces which were involved in the diversification               
              of these related species for it is thought that much of the                    
              variability seen today results from alterations in the patterns                
              of growth in the species.  The results may also have explanatory               
              power regarding the relationship of form, function and evolution               
              in other primate groups.
