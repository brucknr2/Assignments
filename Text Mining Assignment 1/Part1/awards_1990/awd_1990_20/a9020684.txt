Abstract    :
                   The growth of planktonic bacteria is generally assumed to be              
              limited by depletion of organic carbon substrate.  In contrast to              
              this assumption, experimental work with natural bacterioplankton               
              populations in Colorado lakes over the past several years show                 
              that growth of bacteria in these lakes is frequently limited by                
              phosphorus.  This proposal outlines a plan for testing the                     
              hypothesis that phytoplankton possess greater phosphorus storage               
              capacity than bacteria, which offsets the kinetic superiority of               
              bacteria under some conditions.  Experiments will document (1)                 
              the phosphorus inventory of bacteria under nutrient-sufficient                 
              and nutrient-deficient conditions, (2) the uptake rate of                      
              phosphorus through both inorganic and natural organic phosphorus               
              fractions by bacteria and by co-occurring phytoplankton                        
              assemblages, and (3) the phosphorus usage of bacteria and                      
              phytoplankton components in mixed communities for which organic                
              phosphorus is the only phosphorus source, or for which inorganic               
              phosphorus is supplied in a pulse, as might occur through                      
              nutrient patchiness in nature.  The combined outcome of these                  
              three sets of experiments will demonstrate the influence of                    
              phosphorus storage capacity on the outcome of phosphorus                       
              competition between bacteria and phytoplankton.
