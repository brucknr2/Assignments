Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program supports the work of Drs. Scot E. Wherland, John P.                    
              Hunt, and Harold W. Dodgen of the Chemistry Department,                        
              Washington State University, for the study of the effect of                    
              pressure on electron transfer reactions in nonaqueous                          
              solutions.  Specific systems chosen for study include                          
              metallocenes, a series of chromium isonitriles, and                            
              substitution-proof clathrochelates.  The primary methods of                    
              investigation will be stopped-flow and NMR.  In addition to                    
              pressure, temperature dependence, solvent variation, and ionic                 
              strength will be studied.  Rate control by solvents or electron                
              tunneling at low temperatures may be observed.

              This project may increase understanding of the fundamental                     
              nature of oxidation-reduction reactions in nonaqueous media and                
              influence theoretical development in this area.  The results                   
              would also be useful for organometallic chemistry, catalytic                   
              reactions, and some biological processes involving cell                        
              membranes.  An understanding of the role of solvents could lead                
              to some control of reaction rates by solvent variation.
