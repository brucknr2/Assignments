Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study certain qualitative                 
              properties of incompressible viscous fluids, compressible fluids               
              and mixtures of fluids by using techniques of modern functional                
              analysis and numerical analysis.  In particular, she will study the            
              long-time asymptotic behavior of solutions of the Navier-Stokes                
              equations in two and three space dimensions, the equations of                  
              incompressible magnetohydrodynamics in three dimensions, and some              
              integro-differential equations that model compressible flows.  She             
              will also investigate the global existence in time of solutions of             
              a set of multiphase equations.                                                 
                   Very often one is interested in the behavior of a physical                
              system only after a long time.  For example, once a process is                 
              started one might expect that a single type of stable behavior is              
              the dominant observable output.  Deviations from this stable                   
              behavior might be very much unwanted.  The principal investigator              
              will devote most of her efforts to study how various real-world                
              fluid systems behave for a very long time by using modern                      
              techniques from applied mathematics and numerical analysis.
