Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In addition to being the deepest and largest (by volume)                       
              freshwater lake in the world, Lake Baykal in southern Siberia                  
              is intrinsically important to both geologists and biologists                   
              because of its central position in the tectonically active                     
              Baykal Rift Zone, its long stratigraphic record containing                     
              the paleoclimatic history of southeastern Siberia, and its rich                
              endemic flora and fauna, establishing it as an important                       
              ecological system.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. workshop is to                         
              identify scientific priorities for international geological,                   
              geophysical, and ecological cooperative research on Lake                       
              Baykal and in the Baykal Rift Zone.  The meeting will be held                  
              October 17-25, 1990 in Columbia and Charleston, South                          
              Carolina.  Particular attention will be focused on the                         
              importance of the Baykal region to research in global change,                  
              global tectonics, the evolution of sedimentary basins, and                     
              biodiversity.  It will also provide opportunities for                          
              discussions between U.S., Soviet, and third-country scientists                 
              about common research objectives in the Baykal region and to                   
              develop specific plans and proposals for cooperative research.                 
              The U.S. Geological Survey is also contributing to the cost                    
              of this meeting.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the                    
              United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary                        
              efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest                    
              and competence in the field of basic scientific research on                    
              the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
