Abstract    :
              This award supports cooperative research in paleontology to                    
              be conducted by Myrl Beck and others at Western Washington                     
              University and several Chilean geologists led by Francisco                     
              Herve of the University of Chile.  Together they will carry                    
              out a study of the Liquine-Ofqui fault (LOF) which is a                        
              topographically prominent linear feature that extends more                     
              than 800 km through the fjords of southern Chile and into the                  
              active volcanic arc east of the Lake District.  It is thus                     
              only slightly shorter than the San Andreas fault system of                     
              California.  Unlike the San Andreas, however, the tectonic                     
              significance of the LOF is unknown.  The investigators have                    
              located two large exposures of Cretaceous volcanic rocks on                    
              either side of the fault, and have obtained test samples that                  
              have favorable magnetic behavior.  This proposal is for                        
              funding to do the paleomagnetic part of a multidisciplinary                    
              study of the LOF; other aspects of the research (geochemistry,                 
              geochronology, field mapping) are being funded by a grant                      
              from the Chilean government.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Because two U.S. sceintists and six Chileans including two                     
              graduate students at W.W.U. are invloved, this is a good                       
              example of collaboration.  Also, because of the education and                  
              training aspects of the work, it satisfies very well the                       
              goals of the Science in Developing Countries program.
