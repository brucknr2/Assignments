Abstract    :
                   This proposal call for studies in the area of HF-induced                  
              largescale density structures and wave fields.  The studies focus              
              on non-linear effects that arise because the HF reflection                     
              surface undergoes reorientation relative to the geomagnetic field              
              during HF transmissions of high power with a long pulse.***//
