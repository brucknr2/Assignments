Abstract    :
              The University of North Carolina Educational Computing Service                 
              (UNC-ECS) provides computing and networking services for over forty            
              small educational institutions including the nineteen institutions             
              participating in this proposal.  The nineteen include thirteen                 
              campuses of the University of North Carolina, four private colleges            
              or universities, the North Carolina School of Science and                      
              Mathematics (a State-funded high school for outstanding students),             
              and the National Humanities Center.  The UNC campuses include five             
              minority institutions.  The UNC-ECS runs a data network which                  
              connects through the mid-level network SURANET to NSFNET.  The                 
              proposal requests funds to upgrade the network connections of nine             
              institutions, and provide "NSF recognition" to eight others to                 
              enable them to qualify for reduced annual dues to SURANET.  Wake               
              Forest University and the National Humanities Center, included in              
              the nineteen, do not participate financially in the proposal.                  
              Access to NSFNET provides the faculty and students with access to              
              supercomputers, data archives, a variety of network gateways,                  
              automated library catalogs, and a wide range of software.  Primary             
              applications include file transfers, electronic mail communication             
              between local and remote researchers, and remote login to and use              
              of supercomputers and other research facilities.
