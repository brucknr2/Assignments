Abstract    :
                   This Research Opportunity Award funds a project "Effects of               
              Prestrain and Strain State on Uniaxial Tensile Properties of Sheet             
              Steels" at Southern University in support of the Colorado School               
              of Mines' Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                  
              Advanced Steel Processing and Products.  This two (2) year project             
              is reporting to the Center's Industrial Advisory Board.                        
                   The project is studying the effects of strain rate and                    
              prestrain on mechanical properties of ultralow carbon sheet steels             
              and bake hardenable steels.  The relationship of microstructure to             
              physical properties is being established using the facilities of               
              both universities.                                                             
                   The Principal Investigators are competent and have the                    
              facilities to conduct the research.                                            
                   The Program Manager recommends that Southern University be                
              awarded $100,000 for two (2) years.
