Abstract    :
                   This project will develop stability, time optimal, and                    
              minimum effort control theory of large scale hereditary systems.               
              The principal investigator will focus on two broad areas:  the                 
              quantitative behavior of each isolated system and the overall                  
              behavior of the large scale systems when the inter-connections                 
              are accounted for.  The aim is to analyze the dynamics of large                
              scale systems in terms of their subsystems and the properties of               
              their interconnection.  For the isolated system there are four                 
              aspects of the problem:  stability, controllability when the                   
              controls are small, the form of optimal control when time and                  
              effort are minimum, and all the construction of optimal feedback               
              controls.                                                                      
                   Proposed results may include:  If each subsystem is                       
              controllable and the interaction "nice" then the large scale                   
              system is controllable.  If some subsystem is not controllable                 
              the large scale system can still be controllable if some external              
              control impact is brought to bear.  The implications to the                    
              control of large organizations like global economics will be                   
              studied.  Optimal control strategies will be pursued.
