Abstract    :
                   The proposed research will consider several situations in                 
              which natural and sexual selection function together and in                    
              opposition to one another, and how an organism can behave in a                 
              way that maximizes its fitness.  The research combines field                   
              surveys, field experiments, and laboratory experiments.  These                 
              experiments will examine the interacting effects of predation                  
              risk, density, and sex ratio in Gerris remigis, a species of                   
              aquatic insect.                                                                
                   The research will produce new insights into how natural                   
              selection and sexual selection interact to shape evolution.                    
              Additional knowledge of how stream ecology may be affected by the              
              destruction of surrounding land should also result from this                   
              work.
