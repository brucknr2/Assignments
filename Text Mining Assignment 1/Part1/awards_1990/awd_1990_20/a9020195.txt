Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The approaching completion of the acidification phase of the                   
              Little Rock Lake Project in Spring 1991 provides a rare and                    
              valuable opportunity to examine recovery from long term stress at              
              the whole-ecosystem scale.  Since 1983, Little Rock Lake,                      
              Wisconsin has been the site of a large-scale experiment designed               
              to detail the effects of acid deposition on aquatic ecosystems.                
              Two basins of the lake were separated with a curtain and the pH                
              of one basin was lowered with sulfuric acid from an original                   
              value of 6.1 in three, two year stages to target values of 5.6,                
              5.1 and 4.6.  Both basins have been sampled in parallel for a                  
              broad range of limnological parameters to provide baseline                     
              support for an evaluation of the Lake's recovery following                     
              acidification.  System recovery will be examined on two nested                 
              levels.  Drs. Frost and Kratz will monitor the lake's chemical                 
              recovery as it's pH and ANC return towards pre-acidification                   
              conditions.  Within this chemical framework, the PIs will examine              
              biological recovery by focusing primarily on the zooplankton                   
              community.  Patterns of species return will be documented within               
              the two lake basins and processes underlying those patterns will               
              be examined through smaller-scale experiments.                                 
                                                                                             
              Drs. Frost and Kratz are respected and productive scientists.                  
              The institutional support and facilities available for this                    
              project are outstanding.
