Abstract    :
              White dwarfs are the evolutionary end product of most kinds of                 
              stars, including the Sun.  Studies of them are important not only              
              from this standpoint but because they are well suited to determine             
              the age of the disk of our Galaxy and also because they excite                 
              internal oscillations that can be used to probe their structures.              
              The Principal Investigator (PI) wishes to upgrade a wide field                 
              camera he has built with a new large Charged Coupled Device                    
              detector that he has already constructed.  This camera will be                 
              placed on the end of a small telescope and used by a Ph. D.                    
              candidate to survey the brightness of up to a million faint objects            
              across the northern sky.  This work will give a census of these                
              objects and will improve our understanding of their distribution               
              in luminosity in color, from which one can infer their ages.  Thus,            
              this work will provide many new white dwarf candidates for later               
              study as well as lead to a refined determination of the disk of our            
              Galaxy.
