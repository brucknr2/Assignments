Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Kam Ching Leung,                    
              Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of                             
              Nebraska-Lincoln, to conduct with Dr. Il-Seong Nha,                            
              Department of Astronomy, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, a                    
              U.S.-Korea seminar on Binary Star Astronomy.  The joint                        
              seminar, involving twelve U.S. participants, will be held                      
              from November 5-13, 1990, in Seoul and Taejon, Korea.  The                     
              purpose of this seminar is to bring together for mutual                        
              benefit U.S. and Korean astronomers to (1) exchange                            
              information on contemporary techniques for investigating                       
              both close and wide binary star systems and (2) assess,                        
              identify, and advise NSF and KOSEF (Korea Science and                          
              Engineering Foundation) on priority areas for future                           
              cooperation in this field.  Papers presented at the seminar                    
              will focus on new approaches for acquiring data, deriving                      
              fundamental quantities, and interpreting and modeling                          
              binary systems.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The U.S. and Korean coordinators are highly respected                          
              scientists who have a record of successful collaboration in                    
              binary star astronomy.  This project is relevant to the                        
              objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program                       
              which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between                       
              U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the                           
              exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                         
              techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                     
              benefit.  Korean participation will be supported by KOSEF.
