Abstract    :
              A four-day workshop on parallel knowledge systems and logic                    
              programming will be held in Tokyo, Japan, during September 18-21,              
              1990.  The workshop will be coordinated jointly by Argonne National            
              Laboratory and by the Japanese Institute for New Generation Computer           
              Technology (ICOT).  This workshop is a follow-up to the one held in            
              October, 1989 at Argonne National Laboratory.  The purpose of the              
              meeting is to provide an informal basis for exchange of ideas between          
              U.S. and Japanese researchers on topics relating to logic programming,         
              parallelism, and knowledge systems.  It will also provide a medium for         
              demonstration of key system and language principles.  Approximately 15         
              presentations will be given, as well as a number of demonstrations, by         
              participants of both countries.  Discussion sessions will provide time         
              to collect comments and ideas on future direction of the fields                
              represented.  Overall, the on-going cooperative spirit between the two         
              countries will be enhanced by this opportunity to convene.
