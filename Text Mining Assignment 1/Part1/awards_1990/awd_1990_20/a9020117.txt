Abstract    :
              Zygnematales is the most diverse member of the green algae with                
              about 7,000 species in 55 genera.  Current hypotheses of                       
              phylogenetic relationships among the green plants places this order            
              as the sister taxon of the higher plants.  However, phylogenetic               
              relationships among the members of Zygnematales are problematic.               
              This results in part because the individuals are subject to                    
              considerable morphological modification contingent upon the                    
              environment in which they occur and upon the chromosome number                 
              which is highly plastic.  The PIs propose to examine genes that are            
              not subject to such fluctuations in order to develop a phylogenetic            
              model for this order of algae.  The derived model should have                  
              implications for the origin and radiation of the land plants and               
              the factors that may have played a role in the occupation of                   
              terrestrial habitats.  The genes to be considered are all located              
              in the chloroplast.  This suite of genes has proven useful in                  
              elucidating the phylogenies of a variety of land plant groups.                 
              Therefore, the data set produced by the PIs can be directly applied            
              to comparisons of all other green plants.
