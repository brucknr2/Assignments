Abstract    :
              Dr. Andrew Goudy of the Chemistry Department, West Chester                     
              University of Pennsylvania, is jointly supported for work on                   
              hydrogen absorption by intermetallic hydrides by the following                 
              programs:  Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                         
              Chemistry; Experimental Physical Chemistry; and Interfacial,                   
              Transport and Separation Processes (Engineering).                              
              The project will investigate the influence of phase, surface                   
              structure, and particle size on the rate of uptake of hydrogen                 
              by mixed rare earth-transition metal compounds.  Some mixed                    
              transition metal systems will also be investigated.  Methods                   
              for pretreatment have been developed which make consistent                     
              kinetic results possible.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              These materials are known to absorb significant amounts of                     
              hydrogen at moderate temperatures and so have potential                        
              application for hydrogen storage.
