Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During the past decade there has been growing recognition of the               
              desire of some Native Americans and other ethnic groups that the               
              remains of their ancestors should not be housed in museums.  They              
              believe that these remains should be returned for reburial or                  
              reconsecration according to their traditional practices.  As a                 
              result it is clear that significant portions of the nation's                   
              collections of human skeletal remains may have to be returned                  
              within the forthcoming few years.  Although there is disagreement              
              among anthropologists as to whether or to remains should be                    
              repatriated upon request, there is agreement that if repatriated,              
              all remains should be fully documented and recorded first.  The                
              question is, what should be recorded?                                          
                                                                                             
              This is to provide funds for a conference of experts to                        
              established a set of universal guidelines for recording                        
              information about skeletal remains scheduled for repatriation.                 
              Without such recordation the information that may be gained by                 
              studying the remains would be lost forever.  The conference will               
              be hosted by the Field Museum of Natural HIstory which will                    
              organize the conference, provide the meeting space, and oversee                
              the results.
