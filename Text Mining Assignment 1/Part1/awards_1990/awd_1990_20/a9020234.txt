Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on the effect that                        
              soil structure has on facilitation or resisting the                            
              passage of light hydrocarbons such as benzene, kerosene,                       
              gasoline, jet and diesel fuels through soils.  The                             
              project involves use of a dual energy gamma attenuation                        
              system for studying the movement of water, air and the                         
              light hydrocarbons (all of which typically occupy                              
              portions of the void space in porous subsurface media)                         
              through soils placed in a laboratory flume, simulating                         
              groundwater aquifers.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The light hydrocarbons being studied in this project are                       
              commonly stored prior to use in underground storage                            
              tanks, leakage from which constitutes a common source of                       
              groundwater pollutants. Results of this research are                           
              expected to be of considerable value for testing and                           
              validating models that predict the behavior of these                           
              pollutants as they move from the point of origin into the                      
              water table.
