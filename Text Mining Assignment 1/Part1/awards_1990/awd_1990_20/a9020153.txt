Abstract    :
                   This project deals with aspects of descriptive set theory                 
              and its relationship with analysis.  These include (i) the study               
              of the structure of Borel equivalence relations, both in a                     
              general descriptive set theoretic context, as well as in                       
              connection with specific situations arising in ergodic theory,                 
              as, for example, with equivalence relations induced by orbits of               
              group actions, and (ii) definability and descriptive                           
              classification problems in harmonic analysis and the theory of                 
              operator algebras.
