Abstract    :
                   Recent molecular data from open ocean bacterioplankton                    
              populations and hot spring microbial mats suggest that natural                 
              populations of bacteria are remarkably diverse.  The observation               
              of numerous unique, deeply branching lineages in these systems                 
              supports the widely held view that natural ecosystems contain                  
              many novel microbial taxa, some of nearly phylum level depth.                  
              Moreover, particularly in the planktonic ecosystem, related 16s                
              rRNA gene sequences were found to form clusters of high                        
              similarity suggesting that rRNAs might be used as a tool to study              
              microbial population genetics, as well as species diversity.  The              
              P.I.s propose to study the genetic diversity, abundance, and                   
              ecological role of the Planctomycetales phylum in natural                      
              ecosystems using similar rRNA techniques.                                      
                   This approach will identify components of the microbial                   
              community in fresh water systems that have never been assemble                 
              before, and will promote the refinement of an exciting molecular               
              technique.
