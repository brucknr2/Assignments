Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research, carried out by one of the world's leading young                 
              theoretical astrophysicists, is aimed at furthering our                        
              understanding of the large scale structure in the universe and its             
              origins.  While the work is primarily theoretical, it also will                
              include an observational test of a proposed high z supercluster.               
              Other investigations will examine the statistical properties of the            
              distribution of distant matter, and the evolution of the Lyman                 
              alpha forest of absorption lines, and the evolution of hydrodynamic            
              instabilities relevant to galaxy and star formation.
