Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              New oceanic crust forms along the mid-ocean ridge axis by a                    
              complex interplay of magmatic, tectonic, and hydrothermal                      
              processes. These processes are known to vary significantly                     
              along the axis, as manifested by division of the ridge into                    
              segments bounded by transform faults and overlapping spreading                 
              centers. Hydrothermal venting along the mid-ocean ridge is a                   
              first-order process that is responsible for much of the heat                   
              loss from the ridge axis. This project will determine the                      
              distribution, relative intensity, and first-order chemical                     
              characteristics of hydrothermal venting along the                              
              morphologically, geophysically, and pertologically well-known                  
              segments of the East Pacific Rise between 9 03N and 10N by                     
              surveying the water column for hydrothermal plumes. This                       
              section of the ridge was chosen because it is well-studied, and                
              because it encompasses portions of mid-ocean ridge with high                   
              magma supply as well as portions that are magmatically starved.
