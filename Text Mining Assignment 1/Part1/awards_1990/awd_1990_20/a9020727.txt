Abstract    :
              Professor Dagdigian is supported by a grant from the                           
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the chemical                  
              reactions between fragments of molecules in crossed molecular                  
              beams by analysing the light emitted by the products upon laser                
              excitation.  The motivation for these studies is to answer the                 
              question:  What is the effect of having many possible potential                
              energy surfaces on which these reactions occur on the                          
              distribution of product molecules and on the energy states in                  
              which they are produced?                                                       
                                                                                             
              In this project the dynamics of reactions involving molecular                  
              free radicals will be experimentally investigated through the                  
              determination of product internal state distributions using the                
              laser fluorescence detection technique.  Because of the                        
              unpaired electrons on both reagents, these reactions                           
              necessarily involve multiple potential energy surfaces.  The                   
              influence of the different surfaces should be manifest in the                  
              branching between different product channels.  The reactions of                
              oxygen atoms with vibrationally excited reagents, which will be                
              prepared by stimulated Raman excitation, will be probed through                
              measurement of the hydroxyl product internal distribution.
