Abstract    :
              A number of carbamates and benzofurans which are either                        
              commercially used or generated as industrial waste are highly                  
              toxic.  The N-methyl carbamates used as pesticides inhibit                     
              cholinesterase activity. They persist in some environments,                    
              causing serious health hazards. These compounds are generally                  
              biodegraded via hydrolysis or oxidation.  Hydrolysis processes                 
              are relatively slow. While the oxidation mechanisms are rapid                  
              generate highly toxic metabolites, for example aldicarb (LD=0.9                
              mg per Kg) is oxidized to equally toxic aldicarb sulfoxide and                 
              then to aldicarb sulfone. Therefore, knowledge of the metabolic                
              pathways involved in the detoxification of carbamates and                      
              benzofurans is important for their safe use and disposal.  We                  
              have selected carbofuran (2, 3 dihydro-2.2- dimethyl-7                         
              benzofuranyl methylcarbamate) as model compound represented both               
              carbamates and benzofurans to investigate the biochemical                      
              pathways and genetic determinants involved in its degradation. In              
              our previous studies several microorganisms capable of degrading               
              carbofuran and other carbamates were isolated.  These isolates                 
              utilize carbofuran as sole source of carbon or nitrogen.  A                    
              Flavobacterium sp. 50085, harboring a plasmid pRC200 encodes                   
              functions for the hydrolysis of carbofuran.  Another bacterium, a              
              Pseudomonas sp. 50432 harbored several plasmids and rapidly                    
              detoxify carbofuran.  One of the plasmids, pCF2 was determined to              
              be involved in the oxidation of this compound.  The proposed                   
              study is designed to investigate the mechanism of biochemical                  
              oxidation of carbofuran in strain 50432.  These studies will                   
              involved the following: 1) physical mapping of the plasmid                     
              pCF2:2) purification of the enzymes responsible for the oxidation              
              of carbofuran: and 3) generation of transposon insertion mutants.              
              The results of this study are expected to improve our                          
              understanding of catabolism of carbofuran in Pseudomonas sp.                   
              50432.  This should then help in developing microbial agents                   
              capable of decontaminating soils/waters polluted with carbamate                
              and benzofuran compounds as well as in devising strategies for                 
              improving the efficacy of pesticides and for their safe                        
              environmental use.
