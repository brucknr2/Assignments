Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the training of graduate students in                     
              cultural anthropology at the University of Michigan.  This is one              
              of two graduate programs funded in a new competition for support               
              for ethnographic research training.  The program will use the                  
              funds to support the methodological training of cultural                       
              anthropology students before their critical dissertation                       
              fieldwork.  These training activities will be suited to the                    
              individual student's needs, in research training with a faculty                
              mentor or as pilot research to prepare for future dissertation                 
              fieldwork.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This research training is important in order to maintain and                   
              develop the "state-of-the-art" of cultural anthropology's                      
              ethnographic research methods.  The projects will upgrade the                  
              methodological training of cultural anthropologists, which will                
              maintain the intellectual quality of this research area.
