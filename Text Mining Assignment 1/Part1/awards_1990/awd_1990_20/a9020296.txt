Abstract    :
                   This proposal is to simultaneously probe the HF-modified                  
              ionosphere with the Arecibo 430 MHz radar and a mobile 50 MHz                  
              imaging Doppler interferometer (IDI) radar.  With the IDI system,              
              the P.I. plans to make 3-d images of the heated region.  The                   
              proposal, which concentrates on studying heating and cooling                   
              processes during HF modification, plans to take advantage of two               
              additional VHF radar stations to be deployed in the Caribbean as               
              part of the NASA Combined Release and Radiation Effect (CRRES)                 
              program in the summer of 1991.***//
