Abstract    :
                The Biology Department at California State University, Los                   
              Angeles will institute a program to recruit high school                        
              graduates, community college graduates, Cal State L.A.                         
              matriculated students, graduates from other colleges and                       
              universities, and current high school biology teachers into a                  
              research and mentoring oriented program designed to increase                   
              the number of minority students who matriculate into Ph.D.                     
              degree programs.  The research areas that are involved in this                 
              program are ecology/environmental biology, genetics,                           
              molecular biology, and physiology.  Students who take part in                  
              this program will be active researchers in the laboratories of                 
              biology faculty members with proven research track records.                    
                The students will also be involved in an ongoing                             
              faculty/student mentoring program funded by California State                   
              University, Los Angeles.  Several federal reports have                         
              indicated that the United States faces a severe shortage of                    
              science faculty members by the year 2010 if more students do                   
              not become interested in teaching and research careers.  The                   
              demographic makeup of the United State is changing,                            
              particularly in the younger age groups.  Black and Hispanic                    
              school children are projected to comprise 47% of the total                     
              school age population by the 2000 and this change has already                  
              occurred in the Los Angeles area.  The only way that the                       
              United States can meet future potential Shortfalls of                          
              scientists is by recruiting, retaining, and graduating more                    
              minority students and this California State University, Los                    
              Angeles program will help in this regard.
