Abstract    :
              The fundamental problem of obtaining the parameters of the model               
              (assumed) of a physical system from measured samples of its output             
              response to a known input, is one that impacts on many different               
              and important fields of interest.  Naturally, it has a long and                
              continuing history.  The purpose of this work is to break fresh                
              ground by utilizing a new simple deterministic theory founded                  
              squarely on well established passive network concepts.                         
              Specifically, the approach is used to achieve two main goals: 1)               
              stable rational minimum-phase transfer functions can be identified             
              without a priori knowledge of either numerator or denominator                  
              degrees, and 2) stable rational minimum-phase Pade-like                        
              approximations appear to be generated automatically in the                     
              nonrational case.  Detailed theoretical analysis of the basic ideas            
              and extensive numerical simulation will be carried out.
