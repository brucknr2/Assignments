Abstract    :
              Dr. Burkhardt and his new co-editor, Dr. Duncan Porter, are                    
              continuing the preparation of a definitive, thirty volume editon               
              of the correspondence of Charles Darwin, including approximately               
              14,300 letters he wrote and received, printed in full,                         
              authoritative versions, in accordance with modern standards of                 
              scholarly textual editing.  The letter texts are accompanied by                
              clarifying footnotes and transcriptions or description of Darwin's             
              annotations on letters he received.  Volumes of the Correspondence             
              are published in chronological order. Each volume is self-                     
              contained, having its own introduction, bibliography, biographical             
              notes, and index.  The changes Darwin made as he wrote his letters             
              are recorded as back matter of the volume.                                     
                                                                                             
              Under previous grants, the first seven volumes, including 2,715                
              letters of the years 1821 to 1859, have been completed.  Volumes               
              8 through 14 covering the years 1860 to 1866 will be completed                 
              under this grant.  This will include 2,819 letters.  These letters             
              cover the period of critical reaction to the publication of                    
              Darwin's Origin of Species.  These letters were carefully                      
              considered and used by Darwin in his revisions of this central work            
              of the history of biology.
