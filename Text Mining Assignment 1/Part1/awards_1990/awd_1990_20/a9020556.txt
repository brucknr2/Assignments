Abstract    :
              Research necessary to develop a scanning tomographic acoustic                  
              microscope (STAM) will be conducted.  The long-range objective of              
              this work is to develop a practical prototype, fully capable of                
              providing unambiguous cross-sectional images of the structure                  
              beneath the surface of macroscopic three-dimensional objects.  A               
              principal task is to employ parts from an existing microscope, the             
              scanning laser acoustic microscope (SLAM), in synthesizing STAM.               
              Building on our previous experience, this research will start by               
              mechanically modifying the present STAM system.  Its geometry would            
              be altered so that it would use a fixed multi-transducer system                
              which would improve its capability for acquiring precise data.                 
              Once this has been done, we will formulate and test the necessary              
              new reconstruction algorithms and carry out other phases of the                
              work still needed to fully complete the long-range objective.
