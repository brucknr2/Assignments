Abstract    :
                   High powered radio waves directed to the upper atmosphere                 
              and ionosphere can produce changes in composition, electron                    
              density, optical emissions and other radio waves at various                    
              frequencies.  The cause of many of these effects is still unknown              
              and just what perturbation will occur for a given power and                    
              frequency input is still theoretically unexplained.  This project              
              is an experimental investigation of ionospheric modification by                
              modulated high power HF radio waves using the HF heating facility              
              and the incoherent scatter radar facility at the Arecibo                       
              Observatory in Puerto Rico.  The objectives of these experiments               
              are to study the convective heating and cooling response in the                
              natural F-Region ionosphere, to study electron changes in the                  
              electron density in the D and E regions, to analyze for                        
              instability dynamic thresholds and to investigate predicted                    
              thermal self-focusing instability dependence on magnetic field                 
              orientation, pump power, frequency and electron temperature.fz
