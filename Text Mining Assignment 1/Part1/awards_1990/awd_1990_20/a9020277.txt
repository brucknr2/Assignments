Abstract    :
                   The Plant Resources Center of the University of Texas                     
              contains over one million specimens and 4,600 type specimens.                  
              The Center is one of the most active research herbariums in the                
              world, and one of the premier repositories of plant specimens                  
              from the southwest U.S., Mexico, and Central America.  Several                 
              smaller herbarium collections have been absorbed into the Plant                
              Resources Center during recent years, and the University of Texas              
              has provided newly renovated space to accommodate this growth.                 
              Dr. Beryl Simpson, Director of the Center, is overseeing the                   
              final stages of transferring the collections into new quarters.                
              The proposed relocation and reorganization of the collections                  
              will make valuable research resources more accessible to the                   
              botanical community.                                                           
                   Natural history collections such as the Plant Resources                   
              Center are indispensable tools for research into the diversity of              
              life on Earth.  The continued growth and improvement of these                  
              collections will be critical if future generations of                          
              systematists, ecologists, biogeographers, and investigators from               
              diverse other disciplines are to have the essential resources for              
              their research.
