Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the acquisition of several pixel charge-                   
              coupled device (CCD) sensors in support of ground-based optical                
              observing at San Diego State University's Mount Laguna                         
              Observatory.  Several of these will be unthinned and one will be               
              thinned and anti-reflection coated for enhanced blue and                       
              ultraviolet sensitivity.  They will be manufactured by the Ford                
              Aerospace foundry following Science Applications International                 
              Corporation's (SAIC) design.  San Diego State will assist SAIC in              
              the testing and characterization of the CCD's in selecting the                 
              devices for delivery, as well as to help SAIC develop improved                 
              devices and to determine their range of performance                            
              characteristics.  The thinned sensor will provide improved                     
              quantum efficiency and a factor of 9.4 larger detector area than               
              the currently available TI sensor.  The CCD's will be controlled               
              by a quadrant readout camera controller designed at San Diego                  
              State, and by a dual processor instrument control and image                    
              processing computer system.  The thinned CCD will be targeted to               
              three ongoing observational programs - the optical and near                    
              infrared imaging of Bok globules, studies of the physics of                    
              plasmas in stars, and a search for and monitoring of novae in                  
              external galaxies.
