Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will study the                 
              structure of waves that arise in a number of physical systems                  
              through the action of temporally periodic driving forces.  The                 
              research will follow two directions.                                           
                   First of all, the principal investigator will study how the               
              effect of temporal driving in exciting the system is balanced by               
              the influence of spatial symmetries.  This will entail using some              
              recent methods of bifurcation theory with symmetry to derive and               
              analyze the amplitude equations.                                               
                   Secondly, the principal investigator will study the dynamics              
              of parametrically driven waves in large aspect-ratio systems.                  
              Such waves exhibit different types of instabilities that can lead              
              to spatio-temporal chaos.  The transitions to this chaotic                     
              behavior will be studied analytically as well as numerically.
