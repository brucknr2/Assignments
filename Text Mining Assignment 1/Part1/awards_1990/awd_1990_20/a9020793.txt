Abstract    :
              1This award from the Synthetic Organic Program is to support                   
              the research of Dr. R. Karl Dieter of the Department of                        
              Chemistry at Clemson University.  The specific aim of the                      
              research is to develop general and efficient methods for                       
              effecting asymmetric induction in organocopper conjugate                       
              addition reactions and formally equivalent classes of                          
              substitution reactions.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Dr. Dieter will probe the role of phosphines in stabilizing and                
              solubilizing cuprates in order to facilitate conjugate                         
              additions and he will study cuprate structure by using NMR,                    
              X-ray and colligative measurements.  Methods will be developed                 
              for effecting asymmetric conjugate addition using                              
              organometallic (Zn, Cu, Mn) derivatives of chiral ketals,                      
              aminals and amides resulting in chiral systems with potential                  
              value for annulation strategies.  Also, the use of cuprates in                 
              conjunction with alpha, beta-unsaturated aminals will be                       
              explored as a route to simple chiral 3-alkylaldehydes.
