Abstract    :
                   This award supports the collaboration between Professor J.                
              Hemmeter and Professor V. Ustimenko of the University of Kiev under            
              the USA/USSR program for cooperation in the field of basic                     
              scientific research.  The research is concerned with the theory of             
              association schemes and cellular rings in algebraic combinatorics.             
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
