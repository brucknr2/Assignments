Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Hierarchial Data Format (HDF) is a popular object-oriented file                
              format originally developed for use in a suite of software tools               
                                                                                             
              developed and released by the National Center for Supercomputing               
                                                                                             
              Applications.  Those tools have been enormously popular, since                 
              then, HDF has been adopted for use by other kinds of software                  
              throughout the country in other supercomputer centers, national                
              laboratories, universities and industrial labs.  HDF files can                 
              contain text raster and other kinds of image files, binaries, and              
                                                                                             
              custom formats.  An HDF file is self-describing and extensible,                
              two very important features in ensuring portability across hardware            
                                                                                             
              platforms and a growth path for the future.                                    
                                                                                             
              HDF development is nearly complete.  What is needed from this point            
                                                                                             
              forward is support for incremental enhancements, more complete                 
              documentation, and service for a growing national base of users.               
                                                                                             
              This proposal will provide that support for two years.
