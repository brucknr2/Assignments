Abstract    :
              The elevated-temperature lubricating effects of naturally                      
              occurring rhenium oxide, formed by in-situ oxidation of base                   
              metals with small alloying additions of rhenium, will be                       
              investigated.  Different compositions of two-phase copper-                     
              rhenium alloys and solid solution iron-rhenium alloys will                     
              be prepared in a cooperative effort by the Chinese Institute                   
              of Metal Research.  The tribological testing will include                      
              determination of the range of conditions and the minimum                       
              rhenium content for which the oxides provide significant                       
              lubrication.  The fundamental nature of the effects will be                    
              studied by analysis of alloy and oxide structure and                           
              composition.
