Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project examines the formation of precritical molecular                    
              clusters in metastable supersaturated aqueous solutions of                     
              glycine, NaCl, KCl, and NH4Cl.  These molecular clusters                       
              affect solution properties such as viscosity and diffusivity                   
              and plays an important role in nucleation and crystal growth.                  
              A Spherical Void Electrodynamic Levitator is used to obtain                    
              highly supersaturated droplets.  The size distribution of                      
              clusters in these droplets is measured directly by                             
              quasielastic light scattering.  The data are used to resolve                   
              certain important outstanding problem in nucleation theory,                    
              involving cluster size and evolution.  The results of this                     
              interdisciplinary project, by one chemical engineer and one                    
              physicist, are important for better understanding and                          
              designing crystallization process for separation and                           
              purification of many industrial and pharmaceutical products.
