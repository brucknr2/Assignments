Abstract    :
              Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) will be used to                               
              experimentally analyze flow structures and species                             
              concentration in a curved two-dimensional turbulent mixing                     
              layer.  Data from multiple planar light sheets will be                         
              combined to construct a global view of the entire flow field.                  
              Mixing at the molecular level will be inferred from                            
              measurements of the probability density function of mixture                    
              fraction of fluorescence dye.  Flow configurations with both                   
              stabilizing and destability curvature effects will be                          
              utilized.                                                                      
              Curvature is one means for enhancing or reducing the mixing                    
              effectiveness between two flowing streams, with relevance to                   
              combustion and fuel systems as well as chemical processes.
