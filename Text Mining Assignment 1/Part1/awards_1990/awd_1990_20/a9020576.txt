Abstract    :
              Investigators from the Naval Research Laboratory and Lamont-                   
              Doherty Geological Observatory will integrate airborne                         
              gravity measurement with the combined airborne radar and                       
              aeromagnetic Corridor Aerogeophysics of the Southeastern                       
              Ross Transect Zone (CASERTZ) program.  This program will                       
              survey two 220 x 330 km regions between the Transantarctic                     
              Mountains and Marie Byrd Land during the 1990-1991 and 1991-                   
              1992 field seasons.  The survey will consist of a normal                       
              5 x 5 km track spacing and will be designed to determine the                   
              motion, volcanism and deformation history of the Ellsworth-                    
              Whitmore crustal block of West Antarctic and the                               
              relationship of the tectonics of this block to the evolution                   
              of the Byrd Subglacial Basin, the Interior Ross Embayment                      
              and the Transantarctic Mountains.  The airborne gravimentry                    
              will improve the capability to model crustal thickness.                        
                                                                                             
              The airborne gravity system will consist of a modified BGM-                    
              3 gravimeter and carrier-phase GPS.  Secondary measurement                     
              sources will include precision pressure altimetry and raw                      
              inertial sensor data as aids to the primary measurement                        
              sources.
