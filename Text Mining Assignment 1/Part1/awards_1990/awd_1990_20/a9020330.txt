Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This SGER award is for the preparation of the molecular mechanics              
              program DUPLEX for release to the academic community of scientists.            
              The program computes energy minimized structures of DNA, and of DNA            
              covalently modified by foreign substances.  It has several unique              
              features that distinquish it from other state-of-the-art molecular             
              mechanics.  These features make it particularly valuable to                    
              scientists from various disciplines who wish to generate atomic                
              resolution views of such DNAs.  Urgent requests for the code have had          
              to be deferred because the program is not ready for use by workers             
              who cannot code in FORTRAN for a Cray Supercomputer.  DUPLEX, fully            
              documented and automated to operate without requirement for any                
              FORTRAN coding will distributed via a suitable mechanism such as the           
              Quantum Chemists' Program Exchange.//
