Abstract    :
                   The ionosphere has recently been recognized as an important               
              source of magnetospheric plasma and may during active times be as              
              important as the solar wind.  On the day side at high latitudes                
              plasma is accelerated away from the Earth in ion upwelling events              
              called the "cleft ion fountain".  This grant is to study the ion               
              heating mechanisms and ion transport dynamics of the cleft ion                 
              fountain using a generalized fluid model, with the microscopic                 
              effects of plasma microprocesses built in.  The generalized fluid              
              model contains higher moments, such as, temperature anisotropies               
              and heat flows of multispecies plasma, and is therefore                        
              particularly will suited for calculations of parting heating and               
              acceleration produced by kinetic instabilities.
