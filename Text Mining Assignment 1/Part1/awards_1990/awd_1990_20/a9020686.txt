Abstract    :
              A Symposium on "Advances in Computational                                      
              Methods for Transport Phenomena" will be held at                               
              the University of Kentucky in Lexington, January 7-                            
              9, 1991.  The objective of this symposium is to bring                          
              together the leading numerical modelers working in                             
              the area of transport phenomena to share                                       
              fundamentals of the new algorithms being used with                             
              the current enhanced high-performance                                          
              computational power and to discuss potential                                   
              applications.  The program will consist of four two-                           
              hour plenary lectures with twelve thirty-minute                                
              application lectures.
