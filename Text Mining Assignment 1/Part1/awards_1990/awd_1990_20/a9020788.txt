Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will contribute to the understanding of the                      
              relationship of microscopic structure of teeth and  their                      
              function.  Specifically the research will focus on differenrtial               
              molar wear in six, related forms of lemurid primates.  While                   
              these species are related, they evidence clear differences in                  
              dietary practices and hence reflect the impact of food choice on               
              dental wear.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              At a microscopic level, the molar teeth of lemurids are composed               
              of enamel prisms bundled into crystallites separated from                      
              differently oriented crystallites by discontinuities called prism              
              boundaries.  The boundaries are sources of differential wear, as               
              is the orietation of the prism axis relative to the wear surface.              
              Wear patterns can be determined from scanning electron                         
              micrographs of teeth from cadavers at the Duke University Primate              
              Center.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Within the Lemurids, there is significant variation in molar                   
              morphology which impacts each species' ability to shear                        
              foodstuffs.  Maas will test whether the gross morphological                    
              differences are paralleled by differences in the microstructure.               
              This is an aspect of primate dental evolution which has been                   
              largely unexplored.  Clarifying this issue will assist in                      
              interpreting the primate fossil record.
