Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will                  
              emphasize the application of non-perturbative quantum field                    
              theory methods to a variety of problems which cannot be solved                 
              by treating some part of the physics as a perturbation.  One                   
              of these problems is the possible non-conservation of baryon                   
              (nucleon) number at high energies due to quantum-mechanical                    
              tunneling.  A second is the completion of a field theory of                    
              strings.  Baryon number non-conservation at high energies                      
              would lead to extremely interesting collisions at the                          
              Superconducting Super Collider, and a field theory of strings                  
              would be an important step in the evolution of a string theory                 
              of the fundamental forces.
