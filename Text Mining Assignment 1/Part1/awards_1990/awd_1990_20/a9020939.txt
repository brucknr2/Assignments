Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will upgrade the operating systems and hardware              
              of the IBM PS/2 computers of the Department of Atmospheric                     
              Science at the University of Wyoming to allow PC-McIDAS to be                  
              integrated into the department's network environment.  This will               
              allow the wider diversity of data ingested by the UNIDATA SDM                  
              software to be viewed using the more comprehensive display                     
              software and looping capability of PC-McIDAS.  It will also allow              
              McIDAS data to be archived on the larger disks and on tape on our              
              Apollo network.                                                                
                   PC-McIDAS is used extensively for both educational and                    
              research activities.  It has enhanced the teaching of synoptic                 
              meteorology courses offered in the department, allowing the                    
              student to interactively analyze meteorological data.  It is also              
              being used to assist the training of Saudi Arabian meteorologists              
              participating in a special training program set up within the                  
              department.  PC-McIDAS is routinely taken into the field to                    
              provide forecasting support for the department's research                      
              aircraft.
