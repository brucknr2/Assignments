Abstract    :
              Ecological Cognition in Visualization                                           
               This effort contributes to the theory of a user model and a                  
              measurement methodology designed, in part, to permit quantitative              
              assessment of visualization interfaces.  Ecological theory states              
              that the state of affairs in the world can be represented                      
              directly through cognitive "states of affairs" (corresponding to               
              ecological processing aspects).  This work is to test the                      
              hypothesis that ecological processing includes cycles of                       
              "envisioning" and "inspection" information processing operations.              
              The difficulty of cognitive tasks can then be characterized by                 
              the allocation of processing resources (e.g., the allocation of                
              attention) between the (relatively) memory-independent ecological              
              operations and controlled, memory intensive symbolic processing.               
              Thus, this approach allows consideration of the task context as                
              well as viewing logical cognitive operations.  It makes possible               
              testable predications about both abstract and concrete tasks.  It              
              can be  folded into existing GOMS models for quantitative                      
              assessment of interface metaphors allowing subsequent evaluation               
              and minimization of the difficulty of interacting with direct                  
              manipulation and visualization interfaces.
