Abstract    :
                   Many traits of primary interest in plant and animal                       
              improvement programs and in conservation biology are affected by               
              a large number of genes with relatively small individual effects.              
              This often means that relatively large germ plasm banks must be                
              maintained at considerable cost to insure that all potentially                 
              useful alleles are maintained in a population or species.                      
              Theoretical work of W.G. Hill at the University of Edinburgh                   
              raises the question of whether this is a necessary practice or                 
              whether, alternatively, new mutations can be counted on to supply              
              genetic variation needed for future change.                                    
                   This project is designed to focus on two aspects of the Hill              
              work using a laboratory organism (the flour beetle) to test the                
              ideas.  Selection for a quantitative trait (body size) will be                 
              used to determine the amount of useful variation that is                       
              generated by new mutation.  Much of the existing dogma suggest                 
              that most mutational variation is likely to be deleterious                     
              rather than helpful.  The second aspect of the work will evaluate              
              how important it is to apply constant selection pressure to                    
              utilize any new mutational variation that might otherwise be                   
              immediately lost since the new mutations will be at a low                      
              frequency in the population.  The importance of population size                
              in capitalizing on the effects of new mutations will also receive              
              considerable attention.
