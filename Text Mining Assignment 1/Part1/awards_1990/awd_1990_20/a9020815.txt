Abstract    :
                   Computer hardware will be purchased and used to enhance                   
              meteorological instructions and research at the University of                  
              North Carolina at Charlotte.  The acquired hardware will run                   
              software supplied and supported by the UNIDATA Program Center                  
              (UPC).  The equipment would be placed in the joint Earth Sciences              
              and Geography departments.  The common vision shared by these                  
              departments is to bring computer-based spatial analysis systems                
              and enhanced, interactive meteorology instruction into both the                
              undergraduate curriculum and research initiatives.  The proposal               
              is directed towards upgrading computer equipment for                           
              meteorological investigations that will have the capability of                 
              interfacing with a unix-based Geographic Information System.  The              
              faculty are prepared to immediately implement a host of                        
              physical-based applications to teach meteorological principles                 
              and access data that allows for applied research in drought                    
              analysis, water-resource planning, and development of predictive               
              indices of air-pollution.
