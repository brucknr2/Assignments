Abstract    :
               This award enables establishment of a statewide academic/research             
              network for Arkansas.  A confederation of 19 colleges and                      
              universities, representing over 86 percent of the State's student              
              enrollment, has been formed to administer the network (ARKnet).                
              The network extends full service to each school, regardless of                 
              size, via 56,000 bit per second leased lines, and each school is               
              working toward ubiquity of service on its campus.  A training                  
              program has been established to ensure that all potential users of             
              the network have knowledge appropriate to their purposes.  This                
              award builds on a 1987 grant to the University of Arkansas,                    
              Fayetteville, which provided connection to MIDNET, a mid-level                 
              network covering eight midwestern states.  This connection will                
              provide access for ARKnet to MIDNET and the NSFNET.
