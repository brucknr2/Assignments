Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Scholars Award for Methodological Training to a                      
              linguistic anthropologist at the University of Georgia to develop              
              methodological skills in the linguistic analysis of speech                     
              signals using a computer-based system.  The funds will allow the               
              purchase of a machine designed to facilitate graphing and                      
              analysis of speech signals, and to allow the PI to study with a                
              local expert in the use of the machine.  The project will analyze              
              patterns of speech between parents/caregivers and children to                  
              identify aspects of the acoustic features of the interaction that              
              can predict patterns oflanguage acquisition by children.  The                  
              data will be taped speech from the PI's previous research in                   
              English, Spanish and Luo (a Kenyan language), as well as new data              
              collected during this project of English speaking parents and                  
              children.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This Scholars Award for Methodological Training is important                   
              because advances in understanding the importance of "prosody",                 
              the acoustic elements in speech, are necessary to advance our                  
              understanding of how people learn to speak in general.  With the               
              advent of more sophisticated, computer based analysis systems,                 
              our scientific personnel need support to become expert in the new              
              methodology.
