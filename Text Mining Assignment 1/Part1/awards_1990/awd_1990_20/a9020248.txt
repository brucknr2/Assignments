Abstract    :
              The principal goal of this project is to obtain information on                 
              the structure and function of the yeast Saccharomyces                          
              cerevisiae mitochondrial ATP synthetase as it relates to the                   
              mechanism of ATP synthesis.  Yeast is an excellent system in                   
              part because of the established genetics including homologous                  
              recombination and a transformation system, yeast is a                          
              facultative anaerobe and thus mutations in the ATP synthetase                  
              can be isolated and because of the high amount of homology that                
              the yeast ATP synthetase has with other organisms.  The                        
              objectives of this work are two-fold: to complete the                          
              biochemical analysis of the yeast mitochondrial ATPase and to                  
              study a portion of the active site of the ATPase (the glycine                  
              rich loop region) by saturation mutagenesis followed by                        
              biochemical analysis.  Previous evidence from this and other                   
              laboratories suggests that this loop is essential for activity                 
              of the enzyme and conformational changes by this loop are                      
              instrumental in the kinetic responses of the ATPase if not for                 
              the allosteric properties of the enzymes.  This project will                   
              provide a further understanding into how the mitochondrial ATP                 
              synthetase utilizes the energy from the proton gradient to make                
              ATP.
