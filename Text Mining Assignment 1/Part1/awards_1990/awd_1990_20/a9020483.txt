Abstract    :
                   Control of the weed ragwort Senecio jacobaea by the insects                
                                                                                            
              cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaea and ragwort flea beetle Longitarsus               
                                                                                             
              jacobaeae has emerged as a classic example of successful                       
              biological control.  Past studies of regulation following                      
              experimental disturbance have demonstrated that abundant buried                
              seed and localized disturbances combine to activate incipient                  
              weed outbreaks, and that interspecific plant competition and                   
              herbivory by the ragwort flea beetle and the cinnabar moth                     
              combine to inhibit the increase and spread of incipient                        
              outbreaks.                                                                     
                   To further investigate the nature of this balancing system,               
                                                                                             
              the P.I.s' propose to look across spatial scales to determine how              
                                                                                             
              the balance between activation and inhibition depends on spatial               
                                                                                             
              scale.  They will conduct a field experiment that manipulates                  
              disturbances area and levels of cinnabar moth, flea beetle, and                
              plant competition to test the response of biological control                   
              system to spatial variation in the disturbances regime.  A                     
              regional survey that analyzes maps of ragwort flowering plants to              
                                                                                             
              discover how description of population fluctuations in space and               
                                                                                             
              time varies with scale of observation.
