Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aims of this proposal are to employ biochemical and                        
              biophysical methods to further characterize a class of                         
              cofactor-containing enzymes called quinoproteins.   The                        
              research will focus on the mammalian quinoproteins, plasma                     
              monoamine oxidase, kidney diamine oxidase and lysyl oxidase.                   
              All of these enzymes had been thought to contain the bacterial                 
              cofactor, pyrroloquinoline quinone, PQQ, but this conclusion                   
              is now in doubt.  The objectives of this proposal are 1) to                    
              characterize the active site cofactor-containing peptides of                   
              diamine oxidase and lysyl oxidase.  It is possible that these                  
              enzymes have the same cofactor as plasma monoamine oxidase,                    
              i.e., 6-hydroxydopa; 2) to clone the genes and develop an                      
              expression system for plasma monoamine oxidase and kidney                      
              diamine oxidase; 3) to characterize the proximity of the Cu2+                  
              and cofactor sites of all three enzymes using a variety of                     
              biophysical methods; and 4) to initiate an investigation of the                
              biosynthetic origin of 6-hydroxydopa.  These studies will                      
              provide a clear understanding  of the mechanistic and                          
              structural features of these metalloquinoproteins and lead to                  
              a consensus concerning the nature of the carbonyl cofactor in                  
              quinoproteins of mammalian origin.
