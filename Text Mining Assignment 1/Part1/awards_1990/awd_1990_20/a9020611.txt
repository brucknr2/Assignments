Abstract    :
                   Professor Brill will continue his investigations of                       
              theoretical gravitational physics.  He will pursue topics in                   
              both classical and quantum gravity, with studies of effects in                 
              various cosmological models playing an important role.                         
              Alternatives to Einstein's theory will be considered, such as                  
              Kaluza-Klein theory with torsion.  This will allow the study                   
              of new physical effects such as topological effects in higher                  
              dimensions.
