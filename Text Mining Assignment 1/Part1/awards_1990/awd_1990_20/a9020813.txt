Abstract    :
                   A program of proposed measurements on electron - electron                 
              correlations will be carried out using a unique ion - atom                     
              collision apparatus.  The experiments will include the first                   
              measurement of differential cross-sections for excitation,                     
              elastic scattering, and charge transfer for alpha particle -                   
              atomic hydrogen collisions in the energy range up to 300KeV.
