Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides funding to construct large-format Charge                   
              Coupled Devices(CCD) cameras as facility instruments for the                   
              telescopes on Mauna Kea.  These cameras will house custom CCDs                 
              purchased by the Institute for Astronomy (using State of Hawaii                
              funds) from Ford Aerospace.  Two full CCD camera systems will be               
              constructed for use on the mountain.  In addition to the two                   
              systems destined for Mauna Kea, a third system that can operate a              
              variety of detectors will remain in the CCD Laboratory at the IFA              
              in Honolulu, and will be used for device testing, selection,                   
              characterization and optimization.
