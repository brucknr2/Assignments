Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports an anthropologist conducting research in                 
              southwestern Brazil on the social, ethnic, and dietary factors                 
              affecting the incidence of high blood pressure in a sample of                  
              adults.  150 households will be surveyed and biological tests                  
              assessing cardiovascular and metabolic responses to stress                     
              conducted.  The hypothesis to be tested assumes that individuals               
              encountering high stress, due to their social and ethnic                       
              incongruity in their life styles in a rapidly changing social                  
              environment, will have high blood pressure, and high total                     
              cholesterol and triglycerides.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This research is important since rapid socio-cultural changes                  
              take place in all "traditional" societies in the contemporary                  
              world.  Understanding how human populations respond biologically               
              to the social stress that rapid change induces will help us                    
              understand the course of human social and biological evolution.
