Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research award supports a graduate student's                 
              study of the cultural construction of nationalist ideology by the              
              Puerto Rican middle class.  Focusing on the Puerto Rican                       
              Institution of Culture, the project will interview activists,                  
              intellectuals, and politicians to trace the relationship between               
              institutional settings and the development of nationalist thought              
              from about 1955 to the present.  Methods used include interviews               
              with key persons, archival studies of books, pamphlets and                     
              newspaper articles on language and cultural icons representing                 
              Puerto Rican national identity.                                                
                                                                                             
              This research is important because nationalism is an enduring                  
              force in the relations between groups at a sub-national as well                
              as an international level.  Understanding how one well-defined                 
              group has evolved its self-definition will help understand how                 
              groups in general define themselves in distinction to others.  It              
              is especially appropriate now that the Columbus Quincentenary is               
              drawing near.
