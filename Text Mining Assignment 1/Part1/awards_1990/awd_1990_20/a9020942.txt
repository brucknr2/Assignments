Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  There are considerable research efforts underway in the                   
              Southeast which center on mathematical logic and on its                        
              connections with other aspects of mathematics and computer                     
              science.  Along with mainstream investigations in set                          
              theory,model theory, proof theory and recursion theory, there are              
              sustained research programs focusing on applications of set                    
              theory in topology, applications of model theory in algebra, and               
              on applications of logic to topics in theoretical computer                     
              science.                                                                       
                                                                                             
                   This grant will help support a conference to be held at the               
              University of Florida during March 1991, whose goals are to                    
              provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and results on the                   
              leading edge of research in mathematical logic and its                         
              applications to other branches of mathematics, and to facilitate               
              closer collaboration among individual researchers and among the                
              institutions in the Southeast.
