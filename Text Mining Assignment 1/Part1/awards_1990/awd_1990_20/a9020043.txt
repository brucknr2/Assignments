Abstract    :
              The Gas Chromatograph and Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) system                     
              separates mixtures of volatile compounds and identifies the                    
              molecular mass of each separated component.  The GC/MS is                      
              essential when there is a need to quantify soluble compounds                   
              found in dilute solutions.  The GC/MS is useful in areas such                  
              as chemical synthesis, kinetics and structural analysis.                       
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Instrumentation Program to the                   
              Department of Chemistry at Harvard University will help acquire                
              two GC/MS systems.  The acquisition will enhance the ability of                
              the department to educate students and will enhance chemical                   
              research in the following areas:
