Abstract    :
              The application of radar techniques to studies of the atmosphere               
              provides an important means for advancing our understanding of                 
              its behavior. This work will employ special radar facilities at                
              the University of Illinois for a comprehensive set of studies of               
              the dynamics of the upper atmosphere between altitudes of about 2              
              km to over 100 km, encompassing regions known as the                           
              troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. The primary goals of                
              the research are (i) to improve understanding of how radar                     
              signals are scattered by the atmosphere, and thereby to improve                
              techniques for extracting atmospheric information from radar                   
              data; (ii) to study turbulent structures in the upper                          
              atmosphere, and (iii) to better our understanding of the sources               
              and climatology of atmospheric wave motions.
