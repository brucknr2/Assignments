Abstract    :
              This research proposal focuses on the emergence of Post-secondary              
              educational institutions on rural Alaska during the period                     
              1970-1988.  The Ph.D candidate is an Alaskan Native and his study              
              focuses on the role played by Native Alaskan legislators in the                
              creation of these institutions.  Key questions are "Why were these             
              institutions established, and what determined localization to                  
              Bethel, Kotzebue and Nome?  Further, was the primary purpose to                
              serve the educational needs of the Native population or to provide             
              an infrastructure for economic development?  Native leaders,                   
              including lobbyists and bureaucrats will be interviewed in order               
              to elucidate the Alaskan political process, and the way the process            
              is perceived by the Native "actors".  This is compared with the                
              dominant culture's "Rules of the Game" politics.  Documentary                  
              sources from the Alaska state legislature, the Alaska Federation               
              of Natives, the Alaska Native Foundation, The University of the                
              Alaska, and regional corporations provide the official record of               
              events.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The methodology of the study incorporates anthropological interview            
              techniques and draws upon political science "Rules of the Game"                
              theory.  The educational historical analysis will focus on policy              
              matters.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The proposed grant is intended to cover travel to numerous Native              
              communities, consultant fees and transcription costs.  The                     
              preliminary dissertation title is "Post Secondary Education                    
              Institutions in Rural Alaska, 1970-1988: resistance,                           
              accommodations, abundonment." The thesis is expected to be                     
              completed in late spring 1991.
