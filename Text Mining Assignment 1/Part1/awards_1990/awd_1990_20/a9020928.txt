Abstract    :
              Participation by U.S. astronomers in meetings in foreign countries             
              is becoming more and more important.  Over one-quarter of the                  
              active U.S. research astronomers are working on projects in                    
              collaboration with foreign scientists.  Several large foreign                  
              instruments which have unique capabilities are routinely used by               
              U.S. astronomers.  Many international scientific meetings are held             
              in foreign countries.  It is important for the continued health of             
              astronomy in the U.S. that American scientists be able to                      
              participate in these meetings.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The American Astronomical Society (AAS) will continue operation of             
              a program of support for travel to attend foreign scientific                   
              meetings in the field of astronomy.  Each year the AAS will select             
              a series of foreign meetings of scientific importance.                         
              Applications for travel to these meetings will be accepted, and                
              awards will be made by a selection committee which will be convened            
              by the AAS.  The program will be publicized by the AAS at its                  
              meetings and through published announcements.
