Abstract    :
              This project will continue the measurement and recording of radio              
              waves at Palmer Station, Antarctica.  The principal experiment                 
              involves the monitoring of transmissions from distant very low                 
              frequency (VLF) transmitters, and using variations in the amplitude            
              and phase of the received signal to deduce changes in the                      
              properties of the atmosphere along the great circle route between              
              the receiver and transmitter.  In particular, lightning strokes                
              produce waves that can penetrate into the magnetosphere where they             
              interact with energetic electrons in the van Allen radiation belts.            
              Some of these particles can be precipitated into the upper                     
              atmosphere where they cause a sudden change in the conductivity,               
              and therefore a perturbation in any radio wave that may be                     
              propagating through that part of the atmosphere.  Thus, the                    
              monitoring of the transmitter signals can be used to map out                   
              lightning induced atmospheric disturbances that are thousands of               
              kilometers away.  The investigators will also operate equipment                
              that will monitor natural sources of radio waves, such as the                  
              sferics produced by lightning.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Stanford University and the principal investigator are leaders in              
              research on very low frequency radio waves and their interaction               
              with the geospace environment.
