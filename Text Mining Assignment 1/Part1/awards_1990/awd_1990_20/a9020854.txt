Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is to develop techniques to visualize the occlusion               
              of primate molar teeth.  The movement of the jaws in mastication               
              is a highly complex phenomenon and one of considerable interest                
              to anthropologists as the movements are related to tooth shape                 
              and to diet.  Since the primate fossil record is largely composed              
              of dental remains, understanding the relationship of tooth shape,              
              function and diet is a central one.  Here a three-dimensional                  
              scanning device will be used to digitize the surface morphology                
              of occluding molars from two species which differ in dietary                   
              preferences: Saimiri, a frugivorous-insectivorous New World                    
              Monkey and Ateles, a frugivore. The researchers will then attempt              
              to use the digitized models to simulate phases in occlusion.  A                
              museum series of teeth will then be examined to study the effects              
              of wear on the fit of teeth during occlusion.  This information                
              will assist in deciphering the dietary adaptations of living and               
              extinct primates.
