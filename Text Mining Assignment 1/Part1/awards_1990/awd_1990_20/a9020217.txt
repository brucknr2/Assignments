Abstract    :
                   The proposed research will investigate variation in                       
              mitochondrial (mt) DNA molecules among geographic samples of the               
              North American cyprinid fish Cyprinella lutrensis an among other               
              species belonging to the C. lutrensis complex or species-group                 
              in the continental United States.  The research is designed                    
              primarily to infer hypotheses of phylogenetic or genealogical                  
              relationships within C. lutrensis and among C. lutrensis complex               
              species.  Goals to be realized by achievement of the primary                   
              objective include (i) an assessment of whether cryptic species                 
              within the C. lutrensis complex exist in the Trans-Pecos and                   
              other regions in Texas, and (ii) an assessment of the                          
              biogeographic events which led to the current distribution of C.               
              lutrensis and related species in the continental United States.                
              Goal (i) is of importance relative to the inventory of fauna                   
              endemic or native to the a United States and to ongoing attempts               
              within Texas and the southwestern United States to protect and                 
              preserve native organisms.  Goal (ii) will ultimately provide                  
              hypotheses of geological events which occurred in the central                  
              and southwestern regions of the continental United States during               
              pre- and post-glacial times.
