Abstract    :
                   Experimental research on the basic physics of dense plasmas               
              is to be carried out 1) by scattering of laser light and )2 by                 
              measuring shifts, widths, profiles and merging of spectral lines               
              from multiply charged ions in laser-produced plasmas of measured               
              density and temperature.
