Abstract    :
              It is proposed to conduct a research program featuring a concept               
              for treating structural engineering problems involving structures              
              with uncertain (random) properties and loads.  The proposed concept            
              hinges upon the approximate representation of random processes                 
              describing the material properties or the structural loads by a                
              finite number of random variables.  This will be accomplished using            
              the classical concepts of the Karhunen-Loeve and the Polynomials               
              Chaos expansions.  In the proposed program, these expansions will              
              be incorporated into spatial discretizations of structural elements            
              such as beams and plates, in accordance with standard finite                   
              element procedures.
