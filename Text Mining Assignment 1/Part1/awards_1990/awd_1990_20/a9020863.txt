Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under this award, Princeton University will purchase CONVEX mini-              
              supercomputer facilities for theoretical and observational                     
              investigations.  Primary use will be for large scale simulations               
              in cosmology to test the currently considered theoretical models               
              against the increasingly detailed observations of large scale                  
              structure and the background radiation fields.  The local                      
              facilities will be used both for preliminary modelling and for                 
              manipulation and display of the results obtained from NSF                      
              supported supercomputer facilities.  Also significant will be use              
              for processing of both optical and radio images.  For both                     
              applications, the C-220 with its speed, large memory (512 Mb),                 
              and efficient FFT routines is ideal.                                           
                                                                                             
              Princeton University is providing 50% of the purchase price in a               
              cost-sharing arrangement.
