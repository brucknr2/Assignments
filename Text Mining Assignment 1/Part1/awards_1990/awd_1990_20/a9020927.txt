Abstract    :
              Participation by U.S. astronomers in the meetings of the                       
              International Astronomical Union (IAU) is important.  Over one-                
              quarter of the active U.S. research astronomers are working on                 
              projects in collaboration with foreign scientists.  Several large              
              foreign instruments which have unique capabilities are routinely               
              used by U.S. astronomers.  The largest and most important                      
              international meeting is the General Assembly of the IAU.  Unlike              
              many other international scientific unions, the IAU emphasizes                 
              scientific sessions and presentation of research results.  It is               
              important for the continued health of astronomy in the U.S. that               
              American scientists be able to participate in these meetings.  The             
              IAU meets every 3 years.  The IAU General Assembly will meet in                
              Buenos Aires, Argentina July 23 to August 1, 1991.                             
                                                                                             
              The American Astronomical Society (AAS) will organize a program of             
              grants for travel to attend the IAU General Assembly and its                   
              associated meetings.  Applications for travel to the General                   
              Assembly will be accepted by the AAS, and awards will be decided               
              by a selection committee chosen by the U.S. National Committee for             
              the IAU.  The travel grant program will be publicized by the AAS               
              at its meetings and through continuing announcements in the AAS                
              Newsletter.
