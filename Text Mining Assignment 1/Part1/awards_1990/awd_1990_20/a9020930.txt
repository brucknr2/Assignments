Abstract    :
              This special minority award will give Ph.D. student Rebecca                    
              Sanchez additional flexibility to pursue her graduate studies and              
              research in sociology.  This award will strengthen minority                    
              research participation in sociology.  More specifically, the                   
              grant will permit Sanchez to strengthen her research skills by                 
              improving her ability to use Spanish through intensive language                
              training in Mexico.  This is important to her research into                    
              social issues affecting Mexicans and Chicanos, her chosen area of              
              study for her Master's thesis and Ph.D. work.
