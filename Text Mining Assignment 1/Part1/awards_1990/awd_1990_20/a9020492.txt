Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to conduct a purposeful Tracer Release                        
              Experiment (TRE) in the North Atlantic Ocean as a component of                 
              the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  The PI will                    
              systematically release sulfur hexafluoride at predetermined                    
              depths in the ocean and periodically revisit the area to                       
              measure its distribution.  Additional supporting observations                  
              of the internal wave and microstructure climate will be made.                  
              From these, a measure of the mixing rates may be determined.                   
              Ocean mixing rates are essential ingredients in models of the                  
              circulation.
