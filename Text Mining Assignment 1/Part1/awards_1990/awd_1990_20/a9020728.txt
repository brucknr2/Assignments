Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is a numerical technique for                    
              simulating the flow of deformable non-spherical particle                       
              systems.  The proposed technique reduces the problem to that                   
              of solving a set of Fredholm integral equations of the second                  
              kind, and uses parallel processing.  The model can simulate                    
              mechanisms encountered in suspension, such as coalescence,                     
              break-up, particle rotation, formation of ordered structures                   
              and mixing.  The computational time and memory storage will be                 
              significantly reduced as compared to previous methods for                      
              similar solutions.  The P.I. will collaborate with the San                     
              Diego supercomputer center.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The simulations should lead to a better understanding and                      
              basic numerical solutions to a series of industrial and                        
              biomedical applications, such as blood flow, foams,                            
              suspensions, and food processing.
