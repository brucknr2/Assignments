Abstract    :
                   Protista is a complex assemblage of organisms, many of which              
              are only distantly related.  Euglenophyta is clearly                           
              phylogenetically distinct from the remaining protists; however, the            
              ingroup phylogeny of the division is only poorly understood.                   
              Previous studies have focussed on cellular detail determined by                
              electron microscopic investigation of aspects of the flagellar                 
              apparatus and cell division.  The PI intends to combine details of             
              ultrastructural (from the literture and this study) with molecular             
              sequence data from the 18s-like rRNA.  The PI will use parsimony               
              analysis to infer the phylogeny of this group, and based on that               
              phylogeny, to revise the classification system of the division.                
              Findings may have relevance to our understanding of higher                     
              organisms.
