Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research study is a joint collaborative                                   
              research effort between an academic research                                   
              unit and a professional design office to                                       
              investigate seismic torsional effects in                                       
              multistory buildings.  Two projects (BCS                                       
              9020394 and BCS 9116089) are combined into a                                   
              joint cooperative study of the referenced                                      
              topic area as a single research effort.                                        
                                                                                             
              By means of analytical models and a                                            
              probabilistic approach, this research study                                    
              evaluates the inelastic seismic response of                                    
              torsionally unbalanced structures, with a                                      
              view towards developing more rational methods                                  
              of design.  Knowledge of the seismic                                           
              response, calculated for seismic motions                                       
              defined by ensembles of normalized real and                                    
              synthetic accelerograms, are used to gain                                      
              physical insight in the examination of a wide                                  
              range of elastically-based procedures widely                                   
              used in current codes for torsional effects                                    
              in seismic design.  The validity of these                                      
              procedures are assessed by first designing                                     
              the structural models according to the                                         
              elastically-based "static" and modal                                           
              superposition rules, followed by an explicit                                   
              evaluation of the inelastic response of these                                  
              models.  A torsionally unbalanced structure                                    
              will be judged to have been properly designed                                  
              if the probability of exceedance of a seismic                                  
              response parameter (story drift or component                                   
              ductility demand) does not exceed that for                                     
              the corresponding balanced (symmetric)                                         
              system.  Criterion established will help                                       
              identify deficiencies in current practice and                                  
              will provide a method for testing and                                          
              modifying systematically different design                                      
              rules until satisfactory probabilities are                                     
              obtained.  Results from this project provide                                   
              critically important data on the torsional                                     
              effects in multistory buildings induced by                                     
              seismic forces.
