Abstract    :
              Prokaryotic, chlorophyll b containing picoplankton are very                    
              abundant in the north Pacific and Atlantic oceans.  These organisms            
              have been hypothesized to be descendants of the free-living                    
              organisms that are ancestors of the chloroplast of the higher                  
              plants (green algae, charaophytes, mosses, and vascular plants).               
              However, the PIs have detected an unusual chlorophyll molecule that            
              does not correspond to the chlorophylls of modern chloroplasts of              
              the higher plants.  The PIs propose to collect, isolate, culture,              
              and analyze these organisms for the purposes of completing a                   
              phylogenetic analysis.  Phylogeny will be determined using 16s rRNA            
              genes and compare them with prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa using              
              parsimony analysis.
