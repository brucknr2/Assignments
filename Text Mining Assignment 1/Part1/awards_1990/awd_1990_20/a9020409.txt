                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The Songhay language is spoken in Mali (W.Africa) chiefly in two               
              dialect groups, Gao and Timbuktu-Djenne.  (Better-known and                    
              numerically larger Songhay dialects are spoken in neighboring                  
              Niger.)  The T-Dj dialecl group appears to reflect the rapid                   
              extension of Songhay during the "Songhay Empire" with its capital              
              in Gao, which ended with a Moroccan incursion in 1594.  The T-Dj               
              dialects show significant divergences from the Gao dialect,                    
              including a bare-bones reduction and regularization of the                     
              morphology and a shift from SOV to SVO word order.  The                        
              development of the T-Dj dialect group will be studied in                       
              connection with the hypothesis that some form of creolization                  
              occurred in the formative stages, and in the knowledge that                    
              neighboring languages have continued to influence it in its                    
              functions as lingua franca along the Niger River in northern                   
              Mali.  Of the neighboring languages, Hassaniya Arabic (and                     
              Classical Arabic) have been studied by the PI. Tuareg, Fulbe                   
              (Ful, Fula, Fulani), and Bozo will be the objects of secondary                 
              study in this project to complete the linguistic "ecology" for                 
              the developmental study of T-Dj Songhay.
