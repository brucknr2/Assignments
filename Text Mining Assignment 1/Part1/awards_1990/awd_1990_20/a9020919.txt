Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The development of the accretionary wedge offshore Oregon involves             
              the consolidation and fluid loss of the sediments that compose the             
              wedge.  This project will use a combined petrographic and isotopic             
              study of carbonate cements from the accretionary wedge sediments to            
              constrain fluid sources for different generations of cement.
