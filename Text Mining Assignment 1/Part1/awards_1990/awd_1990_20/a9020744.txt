Abstract    :
                   Resonant-mass detectors of gravitational radiation have                   
              been developed that can be reliably operated at liquid helium                  
              temperature (4.2K) with sensitivities h ~ 10-18.  At this                      
              sensitivity level we do not expect to detect gravitational                     
              wave signals from anything but the rarest astrophysical                        
              events.  However, the technology to build an ultralow                          
              temperature (40mK) detector with sensitivity of at least h ~                   
              10-19 and likely 10-20, sufficient to detect gravitational                     
              radiation from plausible astrophysical events that could occur                 
              in our galaxy or its immediate vicinity, is in hand.  The                      
              Stanford research program has the following key elements:                      
                   a) completion of an ultralow temperature (40 mK) detector                 
              now under construction,                                                        
                   b) operation of this detector in coincidence with other                   
              gravitational wave and neutrino burst detectors,                               
                   c) operation of the existing 4 K detector until reliable                  
              operation of ultralow temperature detector is achieved,                        
                   d) continuing research to advance the state-of-the-art in                 
              superconductive modulated-inductance transducers,                              
                   e) upgrade of the existing 4K detector,                                   
                   f) research on advanced detector development including                    
              low-frequency vibration isolation and investigation of                         
              alternative antenna material.                                                  
                   This group has pioneered the construction of cryogenic                    
              gravity wave receivers, and operates one of the three most                     
              sensitive detectors in the world.  Further improvement of                      
              their receiver will not only provide leadership in the search                  
              for gravitational waves, it will provide important                             
              technological spin-off in precision measurements and vibration                 
              isolation which will be of use to a wider community.
