Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist studying the impact of deforestation on nutrition               
              and health of households in Nepal.  The project will measure the               
              health and nutritional status of reproductively active women,                  
              pre-adolescent girls, preschool children and infants in a                      
              controlled comparison of two groups: one living in a heavily                   
              forested, and one in a deforested area.  Methodologies include                 
              women's health interviews, anthropometric measurements, food                   
              frequency and forest food checklists, observations of women's                  
              forest gathering, and key informant interviews.  The main                      
              contributions include assessing the dietary importance of forest               
              products and looking at cultural pattern of intrafamilial                      
              household food distribution.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it will produce knowledge of                
              the dietary importance of wild forest foods that will complement               
              our knowledge of cultivated food use.  This information will be                
              useful to planners of reforestation projects as well as economic               
              development planners.
