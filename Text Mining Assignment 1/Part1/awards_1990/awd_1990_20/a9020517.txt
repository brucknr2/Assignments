Abstract    :
              The long-term goals of the proposed research project are to                    
              understand the molecular basis of and regulation of sequence                   
              specific protein-DNA recognition reactions leading to                          
              transposition.  This will be pursued by studying the IS50/Tn5                  
              transposition system.  Transposable elements, such as IS50/Tn5,                
              are genetic entities which can catalyze numerous types of genome               
              rearrangements.  They are thought to have been important in                    
              evolution and can lead to somatic cell mutations such as those                 
              associated with oncogenesis.  Genetic and biochemical approaches               
              will be used to analyze the interaction of IS50/Tn5 transposase                
              with its target DNA sequences, the regulation of transposase                   
              activity by its inhibitor and the role of host proteins in the                 
              transposition process.
