Abstract    :
              The recent dramatic changes in the Soviet Union have opened the                
              possibility of collaborative educational and research activities               
              involving Soviet and American academic institutions.  To explore the           
              opportunity of such collaborations between Soviet technical universities       
              and American colleges of engineering, an exchange of visits by leading         
              engineering educators of the two countries has been proposed.  This            
              grant will provide partial support for this exchange.  It will provide         
              for the visit to the United States of a Soviet delegation of eleven            
              persons, and an interpreter, who would visit colleges of engineering in        
              the New York, Washington, Seattle (or San Fransico), and Midwest areas.
