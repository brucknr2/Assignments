Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Catalysis plays an essential role in many commercially important               
              chemical reactions and is also an important element in most                    
              biochemical reactions.  The focus of this grant is on models for               
              heterogeneous catalysis under flow conditions, as they provide a               
              paradigm of a nonequilibrium system which can exhibit phase                    
              transitions between steady states, macroscopic oscillations and                
              even chaotic behavior.  An objective is to understand the effects              
              of spatial correlations and fluctuations on the dynamic and static             
              properties of a system in a nonequilibrium steady state,                       
              particularly near a nonequilibrium phase transition.  Research will            
              be conducted on models for heterogeneous catalysis which exhibit               
              both continuous and discontinuous transitions between steady                   
              states.  These studies will be done using numerical simulation and             
              by finite size scaling analysis.  A numerical renormalization group            
              analysis of the master equation will also be developed.  These                 
              methods will be applied to study the effects of correlations and               
              noise in systems that show transitions to time-dependent periodic              
              and chaotic behavior.
