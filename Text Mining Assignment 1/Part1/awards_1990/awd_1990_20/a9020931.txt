Abstract    :
              This special minority award will give Ph.D. student Rosa Pina                  
              additional flexibility to pursue her graduate studies and                      
              research in sociology.  This award will strengthen minority                    
              research participation in sociology.  More specifically, the                   
              grant will permit Pina to strengthen her research skills by                    
              carrying out her first systematic, statistically grounded                      
              project, which should result in her Master's Paper, the next step              
              in pursuit of her Ph.D.
