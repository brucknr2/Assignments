Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary purpose of the proposed program is to identify                     
              and prepare minority college students in the sciences and                      
              mathematics for careers at the graduate and professional                       
              levels.  To this end, a Research Careers for Minority                          
              Students (RCMS) training group with emphasis in cell and                       
              molecular biology, organic and pharmacal chemistry,                            
              mathematics, physics and engineering has been established at                   
              Howard University.  Details of the research program are shown                  
              in the body of the proposal.  The program targets college                      
              juniors and seniors and high school teachers.  Interfacing                     
              with ongoing pre-college science and mathematics programs                      
              (PEW/Rockefeller) and college programs (MARC/MBRS/Howard                       
              Hughes) will allow early identification and selection of                       
              highly competent trainees for the RCMS program.  Based upon                    
              academic performance, letters of recommendation, and degree                    
              of motivation program trainees who are selected at the end of                  
              their sophomore year, will be offered a summer internship in                   
              laboratories at Howard University where they will be exposed                   
              to an intense research regimen in the field of their major.                    
              The summer internship should provide them guidance and                         
              skills needed to attract them into a high-quality research                     
              program during the academic year.  Ten RCMS trainees will be                   
              identified in year one, and a total of 20 students will be                     
              carried by this program each succeeding year.  During the                      
              academic year, RCMS trainees will enroll in an undergraduate                   
              research course (3 cr) where they will work directly with a                    
              faculty mentor on his/her research subspecialty.
