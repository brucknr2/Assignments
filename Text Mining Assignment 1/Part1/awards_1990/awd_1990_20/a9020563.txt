Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation            
              of observations of the near infrared solar corona, in an attempt               
              to understand the relative contributions of electron scattering,               
              dust scattering, and dust thermal emission near the Sun.  The                  
              observations will be carried out from Mauna Kea, Hawaii utilizing              
              a new eclipse coronograph system.  The system is designed to                   
              observe the coronal signal in the infrared H and K bands, and at               
              wavelengths in between, in polarized and unpolarized light, outside            
              and during solar eclipse.  Successful interpretation of the new                
              observations should result in better understanding of the role of              
              circumsolar and circumstellar dust grains, and in particular,                  
              should help resolve long-standing questions concerning the role of             
              thermal emission by dust near the Sun.  This award is made under               
              the auspices of the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)               
              program at the National Science Foundation.
