Abstract    :
                   This research project will allow the analysis of, the                     
              process of coevolution between a native annual legume and its                  
              associated root-nodule bacteria.  This work will answer three                  
              basic questions about the evolution of intraspecific divergence                
              in symbiotic compatibility in legume-Rhizobium mutualisms:                     
                   (1) Do plants and bacteria exhibit similar patterns of                    
              population differentiation?                                                    
                                                                                             
                   (2) Are Rhizobium genotypes from each local population                    
              preferentially adapted to enhance the growth of co-occurring                   
              plant genotypes?                                                               
                                                                                             
                   (3) What constraints limit the evolution of phenotypes with               
              either extreme symbiotic diversification or extreme                            
              specialization?                                                                
                                                                                             
                   The major significance of this work will be to provide new                
              insights about how plants and microbes influence each other's                  
              ecology and evolution within natural communities by integrating                
              laboratory experiments, field experiments, and joint analyses of               
              genetic structure in host and bacterial populations.
