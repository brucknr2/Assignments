Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project concerns the study of the dynamical properties of                  
              weakly coupled superconducting systems in order to understand the              
              transport properties.  The study will be by numerical and                      
              analytical methods.  Also, the project is concerned with the                   
              study of the nonlinear optical properties of granular materials.               
              Existing theories will be extended.  Some effort will go into                  
              studying linear optical properties of composites in specified                  
              geometries.
