Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to investigate the interaction of                 
              a eucaryotic DNA polymerase with its primer-template.  Our                     
              approach involves photo-crosslinking of oligonucleotide primer-                
              templates to active site peptides of the multi-subunit DNA                     
              polymerase.  The DNA primase activity of polymerase alpha and                  
              the 3' - 5' exonuclease active site of DNA polymerase epsilon                  
              will be investigated using modifications of this basic                         
              procedure.  Two different classes of photoactive nucleotide                    
              analogs will be used in this work.  In the first, (5-azido-                    
              dUTP, 8-azido-dATP and 8-azido-dGTP) the photoactive azido                     
              group is attached directly to the pyrimidine or purine base.                   
              The primary amino group of this deprotected oligonucleotide                    
              will then be reacted with a series of photoactive,                             
              heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents to generate                           
              oligonucleotide primers with specifically-positioned,                          
              cleavable, photoactive nucleotide analogs.  The ultimate goal                  
              of this proposal is to isolate and identify by sequence                        
              analysis, specific active site tryptic peptides crosslinked to                 
              oligonucleotide primer-templates.   By mapping the active sites                
              of DNA polymerase first to specific subunits of the complex,                   
              and later to specific tryptic peptides within the subunit, we                  
              hope to begin to understand the structural and functional                      
              organization of this remarkable enzyme complex.
