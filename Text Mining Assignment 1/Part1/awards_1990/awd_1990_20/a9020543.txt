Abstract    :
                   This proposal continues research on the saddle point                      
              method and applies the complex coordinate approach to compute                  
              resonance widths in atoms.  Of particular interest are                         
              branching ratios between optical and Auger channels, highly                    
              excited four and five electron systems, core excited Auger                     
              states, spin dependent processes and the interpretation of                     
              experimental data of highly excited states.
