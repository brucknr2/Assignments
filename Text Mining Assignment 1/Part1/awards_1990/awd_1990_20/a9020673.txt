Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The present study is a continuation of the investigation                  
              on the tectonic history of the Gulf of Mexico. Four tasks will                 
              be undertaken: 1) reprocessing of five seismic profiles                        
              collected between 1977 and 1980; 2) analysis of these data                     
              using a GEOQUEST workstation; 3) preparation of a regional                     
              synthesis of the SE Gulf, including two-week field excursion on                
              Cuba; 4) preparation of an ODP drilling proposal that targets                  
              Jurassic rocks in the deep SE Gulf. The specific object of this                
              study and the ensuing drilling program is to improve the                       
              understanding of the breakup and early paleogeography of the SE                
              Gulf region. A more general goal is to study the processes of                  
              continental rifting and creation of transitional crust along a                 
              transform plate boundary.
