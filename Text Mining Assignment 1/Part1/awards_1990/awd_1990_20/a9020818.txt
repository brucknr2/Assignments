Abstract    :
              This is a request to provide partial support for a                             
              Symposium on Biomedical Engineering and Opportunities in                       
              Eastern Europe, to be held in conjunction with the 12th                        
              Annual International Conference of the IEEE/EMBS. The                          
              Conference will take place in Philadelphia, PA, on Nov 1-                      
              4, 1990. The funds will be used to invite four prominent                       
              engineers/scientists from Eastern Europe who otherwise                         
              would not be able to attend. The participation of these                        
              individuals would greatly enhance the success of the                           
              symposium, and is likely to lead to increased                                  
              international collaboration between the US and Eastern                         
              Europe.
