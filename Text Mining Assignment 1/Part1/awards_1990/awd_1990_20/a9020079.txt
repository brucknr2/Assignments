Abstract    :
              This project will contribute toward the goal of understanding how a            
              computer can be programmed to learn by isolating features of                   
              incremental learning algorithms that theoretically enhance their               
              learning potential.  The features are chosen to resemble features of           
              human learning.  For example, learning devices that use the results of         
              one learning episode to aid in the next learning endeavor will be              
              considered.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Another powerful learning technique, for both humans and machines, is          
              the ability to ask questions.  Investigations into the relative                
              learning potential of algorithms as the language they use to pose              
              questions will be conducted. Preliminary results indicate that the             
              more powerful the query language used, the greater the learning                
              potential of the device asking questions.  Parameters of query                 
              language strength such as the number of quantifiers and the number of          
              alternations of quantifiers will be vigorously examined.                       
                                                                                             
              Current program testing techniques do not and cannot determine                 
              correctness precisely.  The purpose of these techniques is to reveal           
              errors in a program; however, if no errors are found, no measure is            
              given as to how reliable the program is.  Therefore there is no notion         
              of how "close" to correct the tested program is.  The goal of this             
              research is to develop a theory whereby it is possible to say                  
              precisely how reliable a program is when it passes a given test.
