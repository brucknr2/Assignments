Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of              
              the Chemistry Division, spectroscopic studies will be performed to             
              investigate the effects of a solvent on the electronic states of               
              several small molecules.  Both time-dependent and steady-state                 
              techniques will be used, including picosecond pump-probe                       
              absorption kinetics and resonance Raman spectroscopy.  Past work               
              has explored the molecules in the gas phase, but the proposed                  
              experiments will concentrate on the condensed phase.  The time-                
              resolved experiments will help illuminate some of the dynamic                  
              aspects of the solvent-solute interactions.  Data will be used to              
              critically test and extend existing theoretical models.  The range             
              of spectroscopic techniques to be used will provide information on             
              many aspects of the systems under study.

              This study of the differences in properties of species in the gas              
              phase versus in solution is novel in that it concentrates on small             
              molecules, which are more tractable to theoretical analysis and                
              prediction than the large molecules commonly studied                           
              spectroscopically in solution.  Furthermore, the liquid-phase                  
              results can be compared with existing gas-phase data to determine              
              what changes in properties occur in the condensed medium.  These               
              studies are important since a large fraction of all biologically,              
              environmentally, and technologically important chemistry occurs in             
              liquids.
