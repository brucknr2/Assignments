Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a required workshop in experimental                    
              high energy physics to be held in Guanajuato, Mexico.                          
              Organizers for this event are Professor Clemens Heusch of                      
              the University of California at Santa Cruz and Professor                       
              Clicerio Avilez of the University of Guanajuato.  The                          
              purpose of the workshop is to discuss Inter-American                           
              collaboration in xperimental physics, with special emphasis                    
              on work related to the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC).                   
                                                                                             
              A review of physics motivations and goals, and detailed                        
              description of the status of machine design and civil                          
              engineering progress will precede a discussion of all modes                    
              of U.S./Latin-American Collaboration in the realization of                     
              this project.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Key representatives of experimental collaborations that have                   
              entered expressions of interest in SSC detector construction                   
              and of appropriate Latin-American industries, will be                          
              invited to participate.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Other projects of binational collaboration will be included                    
              in this discussion, as well as broader issues arising from                     
              international efforts in collaborative work in High  Energy                    
              Physics.
