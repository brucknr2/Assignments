Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research planned is directed toward increasing understanding               
              of regulation of nitrate reductase activity in higher plants.                  
              The specific objective of this project is to analyze, at the                   
              molecular level, the flavin domain of corn leaf nitrate reductase.             
              The recombinant form of this enzyme is produced in a bacterium.                
              An aspect of this analysis is to generate a vector with an                     
              appropriate gene insert so that both the flavin and cytochrome                 
              domains of the enzyme will be expressed in the bacterium, thus                 
              making possible easy production of large amounts of the enzyme.                
                                                                                             
              Plants assimilate the nitrate-nitrogen of soil and water into their            
              cell materials initially be means of the enzyme nitrate-reductase.             
              The details of the regulation of the formation of this enzyme are              
              incomplete, and the aim of this project is to enlarge our                      
              understanding of this significant process.
