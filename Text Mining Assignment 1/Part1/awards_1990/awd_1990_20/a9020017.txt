              Topology                                                                       
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Poland research project                       
              between Professor Peter May of the University of Chicago                       
              and Professor Stefan Jackowski of Warsaw University is                         
              to continue major collaborative efforts in equivariant                         
              algebraic topology and the related areas of homotopy                           
              theory and manifold theory.  The researchers intend to                         
              concentrate upon maps between classifying spaces of                            
              compact Lie groups which are central to many branches of                       
              mathematics and play a fundamental role in theoretical                         
              physics. There is already considerable cooperation                             
              amongst the various participants involved in this                              
              proposal and number of joint publications have been                            
              produced.  Their continued efforts should yield further                        
              detailed information on the properties of the classifying                      
              spaces of compact Lie groups and the various algebraic                         
              structures associated with them.                                               
                                                                                             
              This project in mathematics research fulfills the                              
              program objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by                        
              enabling leading experts in the United States and                              
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                       
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest                          
              and competence.
