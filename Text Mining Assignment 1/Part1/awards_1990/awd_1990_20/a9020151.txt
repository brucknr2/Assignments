Abstract    :
                   This action is to support research at an undergraduate                    
              institution which concentrates on learning and memory at the                   
              cellular level.  The hippocampus is a part of the brain which is               
              known for its involvement in learning and memory.  The studies                 
              proposed by Dr. Julio Ramirez will evaluate the behavioral                     
              significance of sprouting in the intricate layers of the                       
              hippocampus after cortical lesions.  Two criteria will be used to              
              assess whether the sprouting is behaviorally meaningful: 1) The                
              time course of the reinnervation must parallel the time course of              
              the behavioral recovery; and 2) Systematic manipulation of the                 
              sprouted fibers must produce a concomitant change in behavior.                 
              Because of the employment of anatomical and behavioral techniques              
              this project will provide fundamental knowledge about the                      
              functional significance of sprouting in the central nervous                    
              system.
