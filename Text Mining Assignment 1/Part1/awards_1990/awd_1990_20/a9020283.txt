Abstract    :
                   This proposal is to perform theoretical research in support               
              of experimental efforts to modify the ionosphere with high power               
              radio waves in the HF band.  The research focusses on efficient                
              mechanisms to accelerate electrons, thereby inducing artificial                
              airglow, and on non-linear plasma wave generation.  Basically                  
              this proposal advances the so-called "strong turbulence" theory                
              to explain HF-modification effects.  Presently, studies of strong              
              turbulent processes are on the forefront of basic plasma                       
              research.***//
