Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will be directed at finding the theoretical                      
              foundation for transport and recombination of photoexcited charges             
              in disordered systems such as amorphous and vitreous                           
              semiconductors, organic semiconductors and polymers.  Competition              
              between recombination and diffusion of nonequilibrium carriers and             
              between radiative and nonradiative mechanics of recombination are              
              central problems to this theory.  The temperature dependence of                
              charge transport and recombination is explored under conditions of             
              low and high electric fields, low and high frequencies and                     
              different excitation intensities.  The theoretical work will be                
              tested against experimental data on amorphous semiconductors.
