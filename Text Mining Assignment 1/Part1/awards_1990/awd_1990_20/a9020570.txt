Abstract    :
              This is a project to continue work on the B-SYS system for                     
              biological sequence comparison.  This is a linear array of chips,              
              each chip containing 47 small processors that can do fixed point               
              arithmetic and the character comparisons needed for sequence                   
              comparison.  Previous work has resulted in a 10-chip prototype.                
              During this project, the principal investigator is expanding the               
              prototype, developing software to aid in programming and debugging             
              the array, and studying testability and fault-tolerance issues. The            
              goal is to produce an inexpensive coprocessor with supercomputer               
              performance on this problem.
