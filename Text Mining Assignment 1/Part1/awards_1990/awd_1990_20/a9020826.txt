Abstract    :
                   The 25th Annual Spring Topology Conference will be held this              
              year at California State University, Sacramento, from April 11 to              
              13, 1991.  Over the years the conference has managed to maintain               
              its traditional core of point set topology, general topology, and              
              continuum theory and at the same time expand its breadth.                      
              Dynamical systems was integrated into the conference in 1987 and               
              has become one of the central topics.  Low dimensional manifold                
              topology has been included for somewhat longer.                                
                   This year there will be seven invited one-hour plenary                    
              addresses, one of which will be of a general nature to the                     
              university community.  In addition, there will be about twenty                 
              invited half-hour talks, parallel sessions of 15-minute                        
              contributed talks, and three or four problem sessions.  At least               
              one Japanese topologist will give an invited talk.  Hour talks                 
              will be given by Alan Dow (York University, Ontario, Canada), Lex              
              Oversteegen (University of Alabama), and Robion Kirby (University              
              of California at Berkeley).  Stephen Smale (University of                      
              California at Berkeley) will give the highlight address to the                 
              university community.
