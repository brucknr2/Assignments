Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for a study of parametric decay cascades an              
              strong turbulence effects o collapsing cavitons.  The proposal                 
              addresses several new results in Langmuir turbulence and                       
              oscillating two stream instability (OTSI) lines.  The issue of                 
              strong turbulence versus weak turbulence is an essential issue in              
              the field of HF-modification and this proposal attempts to merge               
              the two theories.***//
