Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to design effective algebraic and                  
              numerical algorithms for matrix and polynomial computations.  The              
              specific problem domains to be investigated include the following:             
              practical acceleration of matrix multiplication; computations with             
              sparse matrices; computations with dense structured matrices, such as          
              Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde, and Hilbert matrices; compact multigrid         
              schemes; polynomial computations and their relation with structured            
              matrix computations.
