Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator studies theoretical and                        
              computational problems involving Markov chains, stochastic                     
              matrices, and their applications.  He examines the sensitivity of              
              the Perron eigenvector of a stochastic matrix, develops efficient              
              methods to compute that eigenvector, and studies the structure of              
              stochastic matrices and their related Markov chains.                           
              Computational methods include algorithms suitable for parallel                 
              processors.  Stochastic matrices and Markov chains arise                       
              naturally in the formulation of problems in a broad variety of                 
              areas in engineering, economics, operations research, and the                  
              physical and social sciences -- for example, in econometric                    
              models and in scheduling problems where the clients to be served               
              arrive in random fashion.  When cast in the form of a system of                
              equations, many such problems have features that correspond to                 
              the eigenvectors of the system.
