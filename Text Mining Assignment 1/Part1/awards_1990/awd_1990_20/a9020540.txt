Abstract    :
              This is an application for partial funding of the Fungal Genetics              
              Conference which will be held from March 31 to April 4, 1991 at the            
              Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove, California, under the            
              auspices of the National Fungal Genetics Policy Committee.  The                
              conference is expected to draw between 300 and 350 participants and            
              will focus, through eight scientific sessions, on the forefront of             
              research into the genetics, molecular genetics, and molecular                  
              biology of the filamentous fungi.  Twenty-three speakers have been             
              invited to speak on their research and approximately twice this                
              many will be chosen for shorter presentations at a time closer to              
              the conference.  All seven session chairpersons, and all invited               
              speakers have been confirmed.  Special effort has been made both               
              to identify younger scientists whose efforts warrant exposure, and             
              to encourage participation in the conference by students.  At the              
              time of the meeting, all participants will be encourage to                     
              participate in one of three poster sessions.
