Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will permit an anthropology graduate student to study               
              the circumstances surrounding the recruitment of Mexican peasants              
              to a Mexican millenarian Catholic community.  The circumstances                
              surrounding recruitment of peasants from different socio-economic              
              and ethnic backgrounds will be studied to try to explain                       
              variations in their attraction to the group. Using ethnographic                
              methods of life history interviews, studies of personal networks               
              and religious experiences, a control group of similar peasants                 
              who did not join the millenarian group will be compared to the                 
              joiners.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This research is important because religious sects are a vital                 
              fact of life in many countries of the world.  Understanding the                
              conditions which facilitate joining, or resisting, these groups                
              helps understand how alternative religious groups survive.
