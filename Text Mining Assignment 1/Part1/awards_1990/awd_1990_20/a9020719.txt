Abstract    :
                   This work is directed to the elucidation of the magnetic                  
              microstructure of coronal loops under the stresses imposed by                  
              footpoint motion due to photospheric convection. The                           
              microstructure determines the (i) the extent and width of the                  
              singular current layers postulated earlier, (ii) the                           
              filamentation of the current flow along the field lines and the                
              resultant enhanced dissipation. It could also lead to the                      
              presence of stochastic magnetic fields with a greatly enhanced                 
              rate for shear Alfven waves. Thus the magnetic microstructure                  
              plays a critical role in the physical processes that contribute                
              to solar coronal heating. This microstructure is also critical in              
              the reconnection processes which relax the stressed magnetic                   
              field to a lower energy state. These processes are investigated                
              using a mathematical model that is treated both analytically and               
              through numerical simulation.  The calculations thus obtained are              
              compared with observational data. ***
