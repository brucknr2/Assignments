Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this proposal is to clarify the ecology               
              of two species of frugivorous New World monkeys: Pithecia                      
              pithecia and Chiropotes satanas.  These two species overlap                    
              significantly in their distributions and in broad terms utilize                
              similar foods.  The pithecines also possess a rather unique                    
              anterior dental complex with large canines and general                         
              hypertrophy of the anterior dentition.  How does this dental                   
              structure relate to physical characteristics of their food                     
              stuffs? How do the species differ in food choices in their areas               
              of sympatry?                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This research will test a series of linked hypotheses regarding                
              the choice and processing of foods by the two species.                         
              Specifically, the PI will, through both field observation and                  
              laboratory analysis (1) test the ability of the dentition of                   
              these species to reduce hard dietary items (2) determine the                   
              importance of each item to the nutrition of each species (3)                   
              study the use of the large anterior teeth (especially the                      
              canines) in food processing as well as the grinding role of the                
              molars (4) determine the relative importance of each item to the               
              diet of the two species.  Through this analysis the researchers                
              should clarify the relationship of teeth to dietary choices and                
              the role of the later in preventing competition between closely                
              related species.
