Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Funds are provided for the purchase of computer equipment to              
              enhance the existing UNIDATA program within the Department of                  
              Atmospheric Science (DAS) at the University of Illinois at                     
              Urbana-Champaign.  A HP 9000 workstation with additional memory,               
              disk capacity and input/output capabilities will be purchased and              
              used primarily for data ingest and analysis.  The UNIDATA suite                
              of software will provide the Department with easy and timely                   
              access to station data and gridded analysis and instruction                    
              within the DAS.  The current meteorological data system is a                   
              micro VAX II and is primarily used by researcher within DAS, but               
              is inadequate to support current research demands and student                  
              loads.  There is a need to reconfigure existing equipment and to               
              acquire new equipment because UNIDATA will no longer support or                
              continue to develop its software for the micro VAX II system.                  
              This award will facilitate the transition from older to newer                  
              technology.
