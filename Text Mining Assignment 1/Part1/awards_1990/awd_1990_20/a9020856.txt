Abstract    :
              Coordinate eukaryotic gene regulation may be induced by                        
              interactions of specific regulatory factors with DNA and protein               
              components of the basal gene promoters.  Detachment of the flagella            
              of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii rapidly induces transcription of                  
              tubulin and other flagellar genes nearly 10-fold above basal levels            
              of expression, making this an ideal system with which to study such            
              regulatory interactions.  To determine DNA sequences required for              
              deflagellation-induced expression tubulin and other non-tubulin                
              flagellar protein genes will be modified for identification,                   
              deleted to retain varying lengths of 5' and 3' flanking regions and            
              intervening sequences, and introduced into Chlamydomonas by                    
              transformation.  Expression of the modified genes will be analyzed             
              in control and deflagellated cells.  Regulatory elements will be               
              located by correlating loss of inducibility with specific                      
              deletions.  Independent confirmation that the regulatory sequences             
              identified in gene sequences identified in gene transfer studies               
              confer inducibility will be obtained by analyzing the interaction              
              of protein factors will these in vivo and in vitro.                            
                                                                                             
              These studies will provide the basis for analyses of the signalling            
              and regulatory mechanisms coordinating expression of this large,               
              diverse set of flagellar genes in response of deflagellation.
