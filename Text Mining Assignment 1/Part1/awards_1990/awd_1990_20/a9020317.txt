Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to advance ecological                   
              theory by starting from an empirical pattern of feeding types                  
              among six sawfly herbivore species, and developing a mechanistic               
              understanding of how the pattern relates to differences among                  
              species in their relationships with host plants, and natural                   
              enemies, and their resultant population dynamics.  The pattern                 
              involves a gradient of specificity in response to plant resources              
              from a highly specific shoot-galling sawfly to a more generalized              
              leaf-feeding sawfly.  Fourteen hypotheses address aspects of                   
              specificity in terms of within-plant variation, plant genotype,                
              plan stree, plant age, and among plant species, in addition to                 
              the relative importance of induced plant defenses, herbivore                   
              competition, population stability, the role of natural enemies                 
              and three trophic-level interactions, and the distribution and                 
              colonization ability of the sawflies.  Methods will employ field               
              observations and experimental studies using potted willow plants               
              to investigate questions on life history characteristics of the                
              species, the distribution and abundance of species, the                        
              relationships between female preference in oviposition and                     
              consequent larval performance, the colonizing ability of sawflies              
              and their parasitoids, and the role of induced plant defenses.                 
              This research is aimed at advancing knowledge by using a strongly              
              comparative approach on a monophyletic group of six sawfly                     
              species which range from species with stable population dynamics               
              to those that are more eruptive.  The mechanistic understanding                
              of linkage among many traits of these plant-herbivore-enemy                    
              interactions is likely to yield an advance in ecological theory                
              relating to such systems, with probable application to                         
              agricultural and forest systems.
