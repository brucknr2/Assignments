Abstract    :
              This project will develop a portable field instrument to determine             
              the condition of steel and concrete large structures in order to               
              make an analysis of the safety of the structure.  Other uses are               
              in the analysis of cracks in steel and concrete structures,                    
              resulting from fatigue, or fabrication, measure residual stresses,             
              determine mechanical properties of materials in-situ, and measure              
              stresses in structures needing repair.
