Abstract    :
                   Collaborative research will be conducted between Andre Wyss               
              (University of California, Santa Barbara) and Mark Norell                      
              (American Museum of Natural History, NY).                                      
                   Isolated from other continents for nearly all of the                      
              Cenozoic, there developed in South America a highly peculiar and               
              endemic land mammal fauna that has captured the interest of                    
              evolutionary biologists and paleontologists for more than a                    
              century.  An extraordinary new fauna from the Andes of central                 
              Chile falls within what previously represented the most poorly                 
              known span of the South American Tertiary record, an                           
              approximately 15 million year post-Mustersan (middle Eocene),                  
              pre-Deseadan (?late Oligocene) interval.  As this span coincides               
              with a major faunal transition, it is crucial to the                           
              understanding of several long-standing problems of phylogenetic                
              relationship among the major groups of indigenous South American               
              fossil mammals.  The new fauna thus marks the first well                       
              represented fauna clarifying the Eocene-Oligocene transition                   
              from the continent.                                                            
                   In addition to being of major paleobiologic importance, the               
              new fauna bears significantly on interpretation of the                         
              stratigraphy and tectonic history in a very broad segment of the               
              central Andes.                                                                 
                   This study has three points of focus.  The first involves a               
              continued vigorous field collection and reconnaissance program.                
              The second concerns description of this diverse, well preserved,               
              and highly unexpected fossil assemblage, and placement of its                  
              constituents into a rigorous phylogenetic framework.  The third                
              consists of the discovery's placement into a highly integrated                 
              geochronologic context.  To that end, biochronologic,                          
              magnetostratigraphic, and radioisotopic methods will be employed.
