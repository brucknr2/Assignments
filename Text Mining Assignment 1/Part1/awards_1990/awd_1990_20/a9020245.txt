Abstract    :
                   The objectives of this research are (1) the analysis and                  
              interpretation of radar and aircraft observations obtained during              
              the Hawaiian Rainband Project (1990), and (2) participation in                 
              the Convection and Precipitation Electrification Experiment                    
              (CaPE) in Florida to obtain observations on the shape of                       
              raindrops, in particular the effects of their variability on the               
              scattering of microwaves including polarization.
