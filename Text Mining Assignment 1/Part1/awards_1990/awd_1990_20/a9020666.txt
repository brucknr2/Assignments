Abstract    :
              A combination of theoretical modeling and experiments is aimed                 
              at exploring the control mechanisms which determine transport                  
              and dynamics within the boundary region between two miscible                   
              fluids differing in density and composition.  The role of                      
              stresses induced by concentration and density gradients will                   
              be investigated, and also whether these might act in a manner                  
              equivalent, to surface tension in the interface between                        
              immiscible fluids.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Results will be applicable to prediction and control in                        
              various interface and two-phase liquid areas such as miscibe                   
              displacement in porous media, emulsions, and dispersed two-                    
              phase mixing and dispersion.
