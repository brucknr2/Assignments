Abstract    :
                   This award enables Drake University to connect to NSFNET                  
              through a 56,000 bit per second link to the mid-level network                  
              MIDNET.  Connection to NSFNET provides the faculty and students                
              with much higher speed access to supercomputers, data archives, a              
              variety of network gateways, automated library catalogs, and a wide            
              range of software.  Primary applications include file transfers,               
              electronic mail communication between local and remote researchers,            
              and remote login to and use of supercomputers and other research               
              facilities.
