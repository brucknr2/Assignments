Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at contributing to the development of a                  
              mechanics of modern engineered material in the following three                 
              areas:  (i) interfacial fracture mechanics, (ii) failure modes in              
              thin films and coatings, and (iii) nonlinear composite theory with             
              emphasis on reinforcement of ductile materials against plastic flow            
              and creep.  A wide variety of techniques are being tried to improve            
              bonding between dissimilar materials with applications to composite            
              materials, layered electronic packages, and protective coatings.               
              Research is proposed to study the role of plasticity in increasing             
              mixed mode toughness of interfaces and thin ductile adhesive                   
              layers.  The initiation of through-cracks and interface debonding              
              from small crack-like flaws in thin films and coatings bonded to               
              substrates will be analyzed.  Buckling-driven decohesion, which is             
              the primary mode of failure for thin films and coatings under                  
              residual compression, will also be studied.  Particulate                       
              reinforcement of ductile materials has emerged as an important                 
              strategy in the development of new structural materials with high              
              specific stiffness or high temperature creep resistance.  The goal             
              of our work is to provide a mechanics for predicting the effect of             
              particle shape, volume fraction and distribution on the overall                
              plastic or creep behavior of the reinforced material.
