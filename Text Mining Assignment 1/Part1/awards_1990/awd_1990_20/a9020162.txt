Abstract    :
                   The Herbarium of the San Diego Museum of Natural History                  
              contains more than 125,000 specimens, including more than 200                  
              type specimens.  This collection is an important repository of                 
              plants representing the flora of the southwest U.S. and Baja                   
              California.  Dr. Geoffrey Levin, Curator in charge of the                      
              Herbarium, has planned important improvements in the physical                  
              curation of these plant specimens.  New storage cabinets will be               
              installed on compact storage rails, thereby providing more                     
              efficient and safe storage without sacrificing access to the                   
              specimens.  The proposed compact storage will provide room for                 
              decades of collection growth.                                                  
                   The proposed collection improvement represents a long-term                
              plan for managing an important research resource.  The community               
              of research biologists depends on herbarium collections such as                
              this for reference materials.  Countless studies in ecology,                   
              evolution, biogeography, and global change will draw crucial                   
              information from this collection.  Future generations of research              
              depend on the care and growth of collections such as this.
