Abstract    :
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on surface processes that are induced by                    
              collisions of gas particles with surface bound species.  The                   
              work addresses the important "pressure gap" which attempts to                  
              relate chemistry at ultra-high vacuum and low pressures to real                
              situations at high pressure.  This type of investigation is                    
              needed if surface science studies are to impact many important                 
              applications.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The current studies of dissociative chemisorption of adsorbates                
              will be extended to examine previously undocumented collision                  
              induced surface processes.  Collision induced dissociative                     
              chemisorption will be developed as a method to probe the                       
              reaction coordinate for thermal dissociation of adsorbates and                 
              as a tool to synthesize novel adsorbates.   Mechanisms for                     
              these processes will be examined.  Molecular beam techniques                   
              will be coupled with high resolution electron energy loss                      
              spectroscopy for these studies, and this spectroscopy will also                
              be developed as a probe for subsurface and bulk vibrations.
