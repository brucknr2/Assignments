Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to develop a detailed,                       
              quantitative, experimentally verified model of the chip breaking               
              process using high pressure, two-phase coolant.  The chip control              
              system injects this high pressure, two-phase stream of cutting                 
              fluid into the chip formation zone.  The fluid stream breaks the               
              forming chip into short segments.  While this process is                       
              relatively simple in practice, the details of it are not known.                
              The research is aimed at developing a fundamental understanding                
              of this new chip control scheme by postulating an appropriate                  
              model.  The analytical model will relate the chip breaking                     
              process to machining and chip control system conditions.  The end              
              result of this research will be an experimentally verified model               
              which can be used to predict broken chip length given work                     
              material properties, cutting conditions, and coolant and coolant               
              flow characteristics.                                                          
                   Further, the experimental work will include measurements of               
              machined surface finish and cutting tool wear.  These results                  
              will be useful in themselves and will also indicate the extent of              
              the effects of the chip control system on the chip formation                   
              process.
