Abstract    :
                   Funds are provided to acquire hardware and software that                  
              will enhance the capability and use of the UNIDATA system at                   
              Northern Illinois University (NIU).  By providing meteorological               
              data services and software for the interactive display and                     
              analysis of these data, the UNIDATA system is used for teaching                
              and research at the undergraduate and graduate level.  A major                 
              goal of this project is upgrade to the latest version of PC-                   
              McIDAS software.  This requires increased computer power and a                 
              change in operating systems, e.g. from DOS to OS/2.  These                     
              upgrades and conversions will all NIU to continue as a strong                  
              contributing member of the UNIDATA community.
