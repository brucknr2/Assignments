Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is funded under the Small Grants for Exploratory                    
              Research program.  The research emphasizes epitaxial growth of                 
              ceramic superlattice materials with five to ten nanometer                      
              modulation wavelength by electrodeposition from a single aqueous               
              solution at room temperature.  The thicknesses of the individual               
              layers is controlled galvanostatically.  The effects of quantum                
              confinement of on the optical properties are being studied by                  
              transmission and specular reflectance spectroscopy in the near                 
              infrared.  Materials being studied include thallium lead oxide                 
              and thallium oxide.
