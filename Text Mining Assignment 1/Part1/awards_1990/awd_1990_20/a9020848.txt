Abstract    :
                   Tennessee State is one of five small Nashville institutions               
              which Vanderbilt University is assisting in connecting to NSFNET.              
              The 5,000 bit per second connection is made through the mid-level              
              network SURANET using the SURANET connection Vanderbilt has had for            
              two years.  Two of the institutions are historically black, two are            
              small liberal arts institutions that emphasize teaching rather than            
              research, and one is a two-year technological school.  Tennessee               
              State is one of the historically black institutions.                           
                   Benefits of the NSFNET connection include file transfers,                 
              electronic mail communication between local and remote researchers,            
              and remote login to and use of supercomputers and other research               
              facilities.  In addition, the local institutions have access to                
              Vanderbilt's resources, and add another dimension to the diversity             
              of resources Vanderbilt can offer its students.  Cross-                        
              registration, software sharing and other benefits also result from             
              the network.
