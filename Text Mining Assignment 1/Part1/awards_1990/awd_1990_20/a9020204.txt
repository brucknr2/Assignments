Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This research will continue and extend the analysis of the                     
              relationship between vegetation pattern (species or lifeform                   
              composition, size structure) and ecosystem processes (nutrient                 
              cycling and water relations).  This project has as its nucleus a               
              set of interacting models that couple ecosystem processes to                   
              vegetation dynamics through growth, mortality, and regeneration                
              of individual plants.  The models will be implemented and tested               
              at several sites, each a member of NSF's Long-Term Ecological                  
              Research (LTER) network, which represent a range of forests and                
              grasslands arrayed along continental-scale temperature and                     
              precipitation gradients.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Analyses will focus on two goals that are fundamental to                       
              ecosystem science and developing global environmental concerns:                
                                                                                             
                   (1) to account for existing patterns in vegetation and                    
                   ecosystem processes under current environmental regimes; and              
                                                                                             
                   (2) to assess the potential responses of ecosystems to                    
                   environmental variability, especially anthropogenic climate               
                   change.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This project will contribute substantially to ecosystem science                
              by further elucidating the "pattern-process" paradigm as applied               
              to feedbacks among plant-demographic mechanisms, water relations,              
              and nutrient cycling; and by providing a synthesis of these                    
              relationships over a broad spectrum of ecosystems but within a                 
              common framework.  The project will also further develop                       
              networking capabilities among collaborating scientists.
