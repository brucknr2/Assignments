Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Theoretical investigations of the fractional quantum Hall effect               
              will be undertaken using a unified scheme for understanding the                
              integer and fractional quantum Hall effects and allowing for a                 
              straightforward and intuitive understanding of the latter.  This               
              scheme provides simple trial wave functions describing the highly              
              correlated incompressible fractional quantum Hall effect.                      
              Extensive tests of the validity of these trial wave functions will             
              be conducted and calculations of experimental quantities will be               
              done.  For the fractional quantum Hall effect, the nature of the               
              edge states will be studied and the utility of a general Ginzburg-             
              Landau theory will be investigated.
