Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The work supported by this award is a continuation of ongoing                  
              research in computational astronomy.  In the area of radio pulsar              
              searches, highly-successful work in detecting globular cluster                 
              pulsars, with emphasis on very deep searches of globular cluster               
              cores, wide area searches of globular cluster halos, and greatly               
              improved searches for short-period binary pulsars will be pursued.             
              In the area of diffraction-limited imaging, improved algorithms                
              for bispectral imaging including use of maximum entropy methods and            
              extension of the algorithms to radio interferometers will be                   
              developed.  In addition to these specific efforts, the potential               
              of future high-performance parallel computers for observational                
              astronomy research will be investigated.  In particular, Caltech               
              plans to acquire a next-generation Intel parallel supercomputer                
              which will have -100 times the computing capability of current-                
              generation machines.  Such a computer will provide significant new             
              possibilities for astronomical research.  Promising new                        
              applications for this machine, and specific hardware and software              
              tools needed for astronomical computing will be identified. //
