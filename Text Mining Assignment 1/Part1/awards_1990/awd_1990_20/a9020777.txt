Abstract    :
                   Models of atmospheric behavior are important for                          
              understanding and predicting the behavior of the atmosphere. A                 
              previously developed  two-dimensional model, known as the                      
              BISA/NCAR model, has benefited significantly from past                         
              contributions of the PI on this project, and attempts to link the              
              dynamics, chemistry and radiation in the atmosphere from the                   
              ground through the mesosphere (85km altitude) into a unified                   
              picture. The present award will continue the development of the                
              model, with special attention to extending its range of                        
              applicability upward from the upper mesosphere through the lower               
              thermosphere (120km). The modeling study will place particular                 
              emphasis on the mean meridional circulation and on an accurate                 
              representation of the energy balance.
