Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project -- the final two years of a five-year endeavor               
              -- involves the collecting, preparation and study of outstanding               
              remains of extinct vertebrates from the eastern Wind T+River                   
              Basin, Wyoming.  Specifically, the project involves:                           
                   (1) the excavation of extremely reich fossil quarries that                
              produce unparalleled skulls, skeletons, and dentitions (50                     
              million years old) of the earliest forerunners of many groups os               
              rhinoceroses, even-toed ungulates, bats, marsupials and rodents:               
              (2) survey of adjacent badland rocks (60 million to 35 million                 
              years old) to recover additional fossil vertebrates from a longer              
              temporal sequence and broader paleoecological settings in order                
              to reconstruct ancient ecosystems and biodiversity; and  (3) the               
              and relationships of these ancient animals.  Analysis of the                   
              paleobiological problems.                                                      
                   Accomplishments of this project to date include:                          
                   (1) discovery and 60% excavation of extremely rich quarries               
              preserving skulls and skeletons of many Eocene mammals and                     
              lizards hitherto known only from teeth and jaws;  (2) scientific               
              descriptions and analyses of the material representing ancient                 
              marsupials, primates, armadillo-like beasts, rodents, archaic                  
              ungulates, and even-toed ungulates:  (3) analyses of new,                      
              remarkable specimens, e.g.: first known skulls of tarsier-like                 
              Shoshonius has overturned traditional views on the primate                     
              evolutionary tree; skulls of the lemur-like Notharctus venticolus              
              demonstrate the oldest record of primate sexual dimorphism and                 
              imply early primate social behaviors; skull of new rodent,                     
              Armintomys, reveals earliest appearance of a specialized jaw                   
              structure called hystricomorphy, a major evolutionary innovation               
              in rodents;  (4) more precise geology and stratigraphic                        
              correlation of Eocene faunas and horizons n the Western Interior               
              of the Rocky Mountains using conventional geologic techniques,                 
              and satellite/aircraft remote sensing imagery;  (5) analysis of                
              biodiversity and faunal change through time; and (6) detailed                  
              studies of evolutionary patterns processes through time.                       
                   Since 1988, these accomplishments have been documented in 23              
              papers in professional journals, student dissertations and                     
              theses, and presentations at professional meetings.
