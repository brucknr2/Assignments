Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will consider several                          
              mathematical models of heterogeneity in cell populations.                      
              Heterogeneity is the broad distribution and rapid dispersion of                
              characteristics of cells growing in populations.  This is a                    
              collaborative project between a mathematician and a biologist.                 
              The main mathematical tools used will be the theory of branching               
              processes for the stochastic features and the theory of operator               
              semigroups for the deterministic (structural) features of the                  
              models.
