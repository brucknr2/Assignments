Abstract    :
              The synthesis and characterization of non-hydrolyzable C-glycoside             
              analogs of 5-phoshorylribose 1 .-diphosphate (PRPP) determined that            
              they are competent competitive inhibitors of orotate                           
              phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase) and that they cannot serve as               
              substrates.  This allows the use of these compounds to assess the              
              thermodynamics of ternary complex formation in the PRTases,                    
              previously an untenable experiment because no analogs were                     
              available that could resist cleavage at the anomeric carbon.  This             
              proposal also involves preparation of another novel 3,5 cyclic                 
              phosphate analog of PRPP in order to test the hypothesis that yeast            
              orotate PRTase changes its mechanism by swinging the 5-phosphate               
              over or away from the 1-carbon of PRPP.  This presumed "change in              
              mechanism"  can also be investigated by inversion transfer                     
              experiments using 31P NMR; these proposed studies would characterize           
              the dynamics between PRPP and PPi (or PRPCP and methylene                      
              bisphosphonate) in the first "half reaction" of orotate PRTase that            
              might bind a 5-phosphorylribose oxocarbocation intermediate.  The              
              apparent "change in mechanism" may result from a competition in                
              rate between the release of PPi and binding or orotate; this                   
              possibility will be studied.  Also included is the evaluation of               
              the likely role of the putative oxocarbocation intermediate by                 
              testing various analogs, (derivatives of O-phosphorylprolinol) of              
              the intermediate on the enzyme.  These studies should shed light               
              on the general mechanism of nucleotide synthesis.
