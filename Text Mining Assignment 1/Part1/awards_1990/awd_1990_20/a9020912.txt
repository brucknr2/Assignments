Abstract    :
                   This award provides support for the seventh in a series of                
              conferences on mathematical foundations of programming semantics.              
              This research area encompasses research on all aspects of the design           
              and implementation of programming languages, including the semantics           
              of such languages.  Topics of interest include type theory, domain             
              theory, and applications of category theory to semantics.  Previous            
              conferences have been distinguished by the breadth of interests of the         
              participants and by the high-level of interaction which has taken              
              place between researchers representing the diverse areas mentioned.            
              The conference includes three types of formal activities:                      
                                                                                             
                             1.  invited talks by five leading researchers                   
                             2.  shorter presentations of refereed,                          
                                 contributed papers                                          
                             3.  special sessions devoted to particular research             
                                 directions                                                  
                                                                                             
                     The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer         
              Verlag as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, as was the            
              case with the 1st, 3rd and 5th conferences.
