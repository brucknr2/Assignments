Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is an experimental                         
              investigation of the coalescence of raindrops with respect to                  
              drop size, ambient pressure temperature and relativity, and                    
              droplet charge.  These measurements will be obtained in the                    
              laboratory where the latter variables will be controlled.  The                 
              results should contribute to the physics of natural                            
              precipitation, particularly clouds not containing ice.
