Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Acid-base status strongly effects many key physiological functions,            
              including enzyme catalysis, ionic balance, membrane transport, and             
              hormone-receptor binding.  Our understanding of this critical                  
              aspect of physiology is extremely limited.  The objective of this              
              study is to develop a model for extracellular (blood) acid-base                
              regulation in an insect, using the locust.  The role of the                    
              ventilatory and renal system in blood pH regulation will be                    
              examined be Dr. Harrison; these two systems dominate exchange of               
              acid-base relevant compounds with the environment.  He will assess             
              the role of the renal system using natural (starvation) and                    
              artificial acid stresses.  Then he will determine the location of              
              acid-base regulatory sites by cannulating individual renal                     
              segments.  These experiments will be based on micro-electrode,                 
              titration, biochemical, and gas sampling techniques.  This study               
              will generate the first integrated model of acid-base regulation               
              in an insect, and will provide general insight into the mechanisms             
              used by animals to compensate for physiological stresses.
