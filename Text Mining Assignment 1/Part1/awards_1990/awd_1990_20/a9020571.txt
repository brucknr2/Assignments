Abstract    :
              There is a need for powerful, extensible speech research tools                 
              with an interactive interfaces.  This effort is to produce an                  
              integrated set of software tools to enable speech research and is              
              a contribution to research infrastructure.  The tools to be                    
              included support speech analysis, speech production and speech                 
              recognition,  particularly from the acoustic point of view.  The               
              neural network simulation tools provide the ability to simulate                
              recognition tools with biological plausibility.  The tools may                 
              also be used for teaching students about speech and computer                   
              speech recognition.  The specific goals are to (a) enhance                     
              existing software research current tools, (b) develop an portable              
              and extensible environment, (c) develop documentation for users,               
              and (d) provide distribution of the software.  The tools will be               
              available free of charge and will be distributed with documented               
              source code so they can be enhanced locally.  Since the toolkit                
              will be portable to several platforms, it can short-circuit the                
              need to reinvent the same tools, with different errors and bugs,               
              in each speech research laboratory.  Students would be able to                 
              graduate with a toolkit useful in subsequent research and                      
              teaching and the cost of subsequent research may be reduced.  The              
              communities of potential users of these tools include computer                 
              speech recognition researchers, speech pathologists, speech                    
              psychologists, linguists, and others.
