Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project supports U.S. scientists'                           
              participation in a conference on Emerging Optoelectronics                      
              Technologies planned for December 18-20, 1991 at the Indian                    
              Institute of Science in Bangalore, India  The Indian Chairman is               
              Dr. C.N.R. Rao, director of IISc.  The topics in the conference                
              include: materials and fabrication technology; devices and ICs;                
              novel phenomena; optoelectronic systems; and lightwave                         
              communication systems.  During the two days prior to the                       
              conference, December 16, 17, several professional short courses                
              will be offered on related areas.  The conference will have a                  
              planery session during the first day where keynote lectures will               
              be delivered by international scholars.  The following sessions                
              will start by an invited speaker to be followed by contributed                 
              papers.  The sessions may run cincurrently based on the number of              
              papers submitted.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Scope :  It is expected that intense exchange of information will              
              occur among the large number of highly qualified scientists                    
              scheduled to attend, and that recommendations for joint U.S-                   
              Indian collaboration will be made.  The host institute, the IISc.              
              is by far the best known academic institute in India, with a very              
              large staff of excellent reputation in the field.
