Abstract    :
              This award will support the construction of a prototype                        
              instrument for real-time adaptive compensation of atmospherically              
              induced wavefront distortion.  Optimized for low-order                         
              corrections on a 4-m class telescope, the instrument is expected               
              to produce images with an angular resolution close to the                      
              diffraction limit in the near infrared under average seeing                    
              conditions, and occasionally in the visible under good seeing                  
              conditions.  It will require a reference star brighter than mag                
              17 within a typically one arc-minute field of view to sense the                
              wavefront errors allowing compensation to be achieved over most                
              of the sky.  The instrument is based on the novel concept of                   
              curvature sensing and compensation and will use an array of 13                 
              photon counting avalanche photodiodes to sense the wavefront.                  
              The goal of this instrument is to demonstrate that such a                      
              performance can be achieved and to serve as a basis for the                    
              development of adaptive optics on existing and future ground-                  
              based telescopes.  It will provide an angular resolution                       
              comparable to that of the Hubble Space Telescope with a larger                 
              collecting power, and therefore will have a considerable impact                
              on almost every field in astronomy especially for narrow-band                  
              imaging and spectroscopic observations.
