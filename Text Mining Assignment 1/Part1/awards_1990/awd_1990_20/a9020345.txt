Abstract    :
                   This Research Opportunity Award funds a project "Deformation              
              and Yielding Mechanisms in Rubber-Modified PVC Blends Using Speckle            
              and Moire Interferometry" at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical               
              University in support of Case Western Reserve University's                     
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Applied                    
              Polymers.  This two year project is reporting to the Center's                  
              Industry Advisory Board.                                                       
                   The mechanism of deformation and yielding in toughened                    
              polyvinylchlorine blends with chlorinated polyethylene is being                
              investigated.  Grating objective speckle and moire interferometry              
              techniques are identifying regions of elastic and plastic                      
              deformation to develop the criteria for stress-whitening based on              
              the components of stress on the elastic/plastic interface.                     
                   The Principal Investigators are competent and have the                    
              facilities to perform the research.                                            
                   The Program Manager recommends that Florida Agricultural and              
              Mechanical University be awarded $99,979 for a two (2) year                    
              project.
