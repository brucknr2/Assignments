Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for the study of the large scale structure of the                
              universe.  Current observations show inhomogeneities on much larger            
              scales than previously thought.  Dr. Szalay, a leading                         
              theoretician, will work with a number of observers specializing in             
              this area to clarify and confirm some of the puzzling data which               
              seem to indicate periodic distributions of matter with redshift at             
              great distances.  The success of the proposed research may bring               
              major advances in our understanding of the structure of the                    
              universe.
