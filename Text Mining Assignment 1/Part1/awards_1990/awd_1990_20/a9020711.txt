Abstract    :
              In this collaboration, investigators from GMU and MIT will pursue              
              a computational tutoring and learning environment for foreign                  
              language learning.  GMU will enhance its naturalistic, immersion-              
              style foreign language experience.  Based on the premise that                  
              language is most thoroughly and memorably learned in the course                
              of meaningful use, this system integrates dialogue and rich                    
              graphical interaction in the context of everyday scenes.  The MIT              
              group has over four years built extensive theory-based natural                 
              language processing software with language independent semantics               
              and multi-level error handling especially designed for tutorial                
              purposes.  The collaboration will have important research                      
              benefits in both directions.  The MIT language software will                   
              greatly enhance the GMU immersion system and permit a proper                   
              study of its efficacy.  The error diagnosis capabilities will                  
              permit an investigation of student modeling, with potential long-              
              term consequences for the study of both intelligent tutoring                   
              systems and psycholinguistics.
