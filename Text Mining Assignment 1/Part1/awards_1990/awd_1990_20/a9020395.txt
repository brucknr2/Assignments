Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This conference grant supports an international workshop on voltage            
              collapse and voltage regulation for U.S. and Sub-Saharan African               
              scientists/engineers.  Power system engineers from several African             
              countries will be invited to participate in a four-day tutorial/lecture        
              in Nigeria with experts in the power field from U.S. academia,                 
              industry, and government.  A major objective of the workshop is to             
              increase participation of Third World countries in providing solutions         
              to these problems.  Participants will define the common needs for              
              development, and formulate research priorities for cooperative                 
              research or exchange programs.  Reliable power is a prerequisite for           
              most activities in modern society, including most scientific endeavors.        
              The problems to be dealt with in the power system become increasingly          
              important as the complexity of the power grid increases.  The current          
              modelling tools and experimental data are not sufficient for                   
              understanding the problems.  The workshop promises to be mutually              
              beneficial for U.S. and African engineers by helping them in the               
              development of a new theory for large scale nonlinear systems such as          
              power systems.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the              
              Science in Developing Countries (SDC) Program with regard to strength-         
              ening the scientific and engineering infrastructure in developing              
              countries, and increasing the level of cooperation between U.S.                
              scientists and engineers and their counterparts in developing                  
              countries.
