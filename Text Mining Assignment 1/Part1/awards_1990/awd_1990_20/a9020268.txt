Abstract    :
              Vibrio related bacteria comprise a significant portion of the                  
              heterotrophic bacteria of the world's oceans, costal waters and                
              estuaries.  The systematics of these organisms is of major                     
              importance in understanding biodiversity at the microbial level.               
              Numerous studies in systematics have been done using traditional               
              traits and, more recently, RNA and DNA data.  This study seeks to              
              incorporate phenotypic and genotypic attributes to define more                 
              accurately the systematics of the Vibrionaceae, Aeromonadaceae and             
              related organisms.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Previous investigations carried out in the laboratory of the PIs               
              focused on collection of morphological and RNA data, as well as                
              developing a number of analyses of this information.  This effort              
              will add further RNA and DNA data to the data bank.  Our ultimate              
              goal is a complete set of information for reference strains of the             
              genera Vibrio, Aeromonas, Photobacterium, Alteromonas (Shewanella),            
              and others.
