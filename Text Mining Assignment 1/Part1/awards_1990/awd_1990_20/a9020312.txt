Abstract    :
                   One approach to understanding the causes of the differences               
              between males and females as well as the implications of such                  
              differences for social interactions between them, is to perform                
              detailed studies of organisms in which the "traditional" sex role              
              are reversed.  Such species exist, although they are few in                    
              number.                                                                        
                   This research will involve a detailed behavioral study of                 
              Jacanas jacana a species of Shorebird.  In this species males                  
              perform all of the "parental" care of the eggs and young.                      
              Females compete among themselves to obtain access to males.  By                
              individually marking all members of a population, the                          
              researchers will detail social interactions and reproductive                   
              outcome.  The study offers opportunities to gain insights into                 
              the evolution of sex-role reversal and the origins of exclusive                
              male parental care.  It should also lead to a better                           
              understanding of the dynamics of reproductive conflict between                 
              the sexes.  The study will provide information of use in                       
              assessing tropical biodiversity since this species is one of the               
              most ubiquitous indicator species inhabiting aquatic habitats                  
              throughout the would's tropics.
