Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     This is a theoretical study of the dynamic processes shaping           
              mantle flow beneath mid.ocean spreading centers. three                         
              dimensional numerical models of flow beneath a spreading center                
              will be constructed to try to explain observed bulls.eye gravity               
              anomalies along slow.spreading ridges and their absence along                  
              intermediate and fast spreading ridges. The models will include                
              the irreversible effects of melting on shaping the density                     
              structure and will explore the effects of spatial, temperature,                
              and composition dependent rheology.
