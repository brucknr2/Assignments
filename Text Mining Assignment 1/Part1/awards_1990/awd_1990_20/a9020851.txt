Abstract    :
              David Lipscomb is one of five small Nashville institutions which               
              Vanderbilt University is assisting in connecting to NSFNET.  The               
              56,000 bit per second connection is made through the mid-level                 
              network SURANET using the SURANET connection Vanderbilt has had for            
              two years.  Two of the institutions are historically black, two are            
              small liberal arts institutions that emphasize teaching rather than            
              research, and one is a two-year technological school.  David                   
              Lipscomb is one of the small liberal arts institutions.  Benefits              
              of the NSFNET connection include file transfers, electronic mail               
              communication between local and remote researchers, and remote                 
              login to and use of supercomputers and other research facilities.              
              In addition, the local institutions have access to Vanderbilt's                
              resources, and add another dimension to the diversity of resources             
              Vanderbilt can offer its students.  Cross-registration, software               
              sharing and other benefits also result from the network.
