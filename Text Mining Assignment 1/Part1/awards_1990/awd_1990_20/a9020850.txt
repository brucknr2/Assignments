Abstract    :
                   Nashville State Technical Institute is one of five small                  
              Nashville institutions which Vanderbilt University is assisting in             
              connecting to NSFNET.  The 56,000 bit per second connection is made            
              through the mid-level network SURANET using the SURANET connection             
              Vanderbilt has had for two years.  Two of the institutions are                 
              historically black, two are small liberal arts institutions that               
              emphasize teaching rather than research, and one is a two-year                 
              technological school.  Nashville State is the two-year technical               
              school.                                                                        
                   Benefits of the NSFNET connection include file transfers,                 
              electronic mail communication between local and remote researchers,            
              and remote login to and use of supercomputers and other research               
              facilities.  In addition, the local institutions have access to                
              Vanderbilt's resources, and add another dimension to the diversity             
              of resources Vanderbilt can offer its students.  Cross-                        
              registration, software sharing and other benefits also result from             
              the network.
