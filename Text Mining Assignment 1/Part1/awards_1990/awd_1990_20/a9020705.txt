Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Eastern New Mexico University is establishing a connection to                  
              NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line through the New Mexico                
              TECHNET state network and the WESTNET mid-level network.  The                  
              connection enhances collaborations of campus scientists with                   
              colleagues at other institutions in fields such as chemistry,                  
              geology, anthropology, and the social and behavioral sciences,                 
              and allows access to libraries and other remote facilities                     
              throughout the internet.  This award funds part of the costs for               
              two years.***
