Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Station data and gridded analyses and forecasts from                      
              numerical models have been used extensively for research and                   
              instruction in the Department of Meteorology at the University of              
              Utah.  The elimination of UNIDATA support for the VMS operating                
              system, in conjunction with other factors, has led to the need to              
              reconfigure existing equipment and to acquire new equipment.  A                
              graphics workstation will be purchased for instruction, image                  
              analysis, research model development, and data ingest.  The                    
              workstation will be equipped with a large capacity disk drive,                 
              backup tape and CD-ROM reader.  The new workstation will allow                 
              students to have improved access to real-time and archived                     
              weather data in undergraduate and graduate level classes.  The                 
              workstation will also provide a means to develop research models               
              that are impractical using the existing workstations in the                    
              Department.
