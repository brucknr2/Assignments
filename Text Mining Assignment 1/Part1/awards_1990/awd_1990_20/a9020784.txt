Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              St. Mary's College requests support from NSF for connection of                 
              its campus network to BARRnet.  BARRnet is the midlevel network                
              located in the state of California.  BARRnet will provide                      
              operations management and information services and it will give                
              St. Mary's College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to                 
              the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)                    
              National Backbone network.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be                
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers              
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.                
              Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.  This                
              is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative              
              educational resources.***
