Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to obtain reliable estimates of               
              precision (reproducibility and repeatibilty) of selected laboratory            
              properties of rock, working primarily with published standards of              
              American Society for Rock Mechanics.  Based on the results of this             
              investigation, modifications will be proposed to fine tune existing            
              standard test methods.  The analyses and the interpretation of the             
              data with regard to both test methods and test materials will be               
              disseminated via publications, technical meetings and training                 
              sessions.
