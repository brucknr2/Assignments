Abstract    :
              This research is to develop a class of decentralized dynamic                   
              processes designed to converge to equilibria.  These processes                 
              may also be regarded as distributed algorithms for computing                   
              solutions of systems of equations--the equations that                          
              characterize equilibrium.  Unlike most dynamic processes that                  
              have been used to study stability of mechanisms, these processes               
              are not given by differential or difference equations.                         
              Furthermore, these processes need not be temporally homogeneous.               
              Some characteristics of this class of dynamic processes are:  i)               
              There is an agent, personifying an institution such as an                      
              organized market, or a central computer, who plays the role of                 
              coordinator; ii) no agent, including the coordinator, knows                    
              anything about the equilibrium equations of other agents; iii)                 
              the coordinator selects and announces points of the message space              
              to the other agents, referred to as private agents.  iv) no                    
              private agent is required to evaluate his equilibrium function,                
              but only to determine its sign at a given point m.  For example,               
              in the setting of a market, it is easier for an agent to estimate              
              whether a given allocation gives him more than he wants (positive              
              excess demand) or less (negative) than to quantify the precise                 
              amount by which the allocation differs from his demands.  No                   
              other computations are performed by the private agents.  The                   
              researchers will explore new processes of this type for both                   
              linear equations, and nonlinear equations.
