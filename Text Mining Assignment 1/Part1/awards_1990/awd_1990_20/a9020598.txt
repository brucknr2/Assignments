Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests support for a 2 1/2 day Workshop on                     
              Conceptual Models of Scientific Computing, with roughly 30                     
              participants.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The workshop will bring together computational scientists and                  
              researchers in computer system performance modeling, with the                  
              goal of fostering collaborative development of a set of useful                 
              conceptual models of large-scale scientific computations.  In the              
              longer-term, the conceptual models developed will provide a                    
              framework and a set of parameters to be used in understanding and              
              predicting the performance of scientific computations and                      
              computer systems.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The workshop will have two major benefits.  The first will be a                
              set of documentation, including position papers prepared by the                
              attendees, and a workshop report outlining the discussions and                 
              recommendations of the workshop participants.  The second will be              
              to foster communication and collaboration among the groups                     
              represented there.
