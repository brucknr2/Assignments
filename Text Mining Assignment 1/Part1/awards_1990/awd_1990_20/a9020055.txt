Abstract    :
                   Onagraceae is one of the most thoroughly studied families                 
              among the flowering plants.  The family has the potential to serve             
              as a model for the study of adaptive radiation.  However, a                    
              rigorous, detailed phylogeny is required to provide a foundation               
              for additional work on radiation within the family.  Traditional               
              characters have failed to resolve adequately the evolutionary                  
              pattern wtihin Onagraceae.  The PI proposes to use cpDNA                       
              restriction site variation and sequence analyses of nuclear rDNA               
              to explore phylogeny within the tribe Epilobeae and to sequence                
              rbcL from cpDNA to examine intertribal phylogenetic relationships              
              within the family as a whole.  He will also use these and other                
              methods to fix Onagraceae within the larger order Myrtales.                    
              Finally, the inferred phylogeny will be used to assess character               
              evolution within the family.  The proposed research should permit              
              the reexamination of the systematics of the family as well as                  
              morphological and physiological evolution that will permit                     
              additional levels of syntheses concerning adaptation and evolution.
