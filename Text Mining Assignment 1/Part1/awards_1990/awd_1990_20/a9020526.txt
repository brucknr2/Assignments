Abstract    :
              The project aims at the study of the friction mechanism of                     
              particles along an interface with a solid body by                              
              conducting theoretical and experimental work. The                              
              theoretical work is based on a mechanical (S.G.-Sphere-in-                     
              the-Groove) model of a single particle . The experimental                      
              work entails building two testing apparatuses. One will                        
              utilize photoelastic ideal particles to study the                              
              interparticle and interface/particle contacts. The other                       
              apparatus will study the friction between ideal particles                      
              and natural sands along interfaces of controlled roughness.                    
              The experimental and theoretical work will then be                             
              incorporated to predict friction coefficient of granular                       
              soil .
