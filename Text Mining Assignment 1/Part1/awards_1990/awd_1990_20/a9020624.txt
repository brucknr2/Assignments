Abstract    :
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                    
              metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Klemperer will                     
              continue his studies of the synthesis and reactivity of soluble                
              transition metal oxides.  The experimental approach shows                      
              promise towards developing an understanding of the fundamental                 
              basis for important heterogeneous catalysts.  These catalysts                  
              are critical to the chemical industry.                                         
                                                                                             
              Five major areas will be investigated.  First, the chemistry of                
              soluble oxide inclusion complexes will be examined.  Second,                   
              the mechanism of dioxygen activation towards organic molecules                 
              will be studied in organoiridium complexes bound to                            
              polyoxoanions.  The third area will be concerned with                          
              performing the same types of transformations with ruthenium                    
              complexes.  The fourth and fifth areas deal with the                           
              exploration of niobate and tantalate oxide solution chemistry.                 
              The significance of the research lies in part in the                           
              understanding gained about fundamental processes of industrial                 
              and biological significance relating to the controlled                         
              autoxidation of organic materials.  In addition, new and                       
              hopefully useful materials should be discovered.
