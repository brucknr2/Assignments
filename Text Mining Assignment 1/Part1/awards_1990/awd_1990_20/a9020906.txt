Abstract    :
                   This Research Opportunity Award funds a project "Design for               
              Recognizability in Flexible Manufacturing" at Tuskegee University              
              in support of Georgia Institute of Technology's Industry/University            
              Cooperative Research Center for Material Handling.  This two year              
              project is approved by and reporting to the Center's Industry                  
              Advisory Board.                                                                
                   The research is 1.) developing the guidelines for designing               
              or modifying a part to comply with a proposed new method for easy              
              and reliable recognition of an isolated object on a flat surface,              
              by a robot fitted with a retroreflective vision sensor; 2.)                    
              designing and modifying specific components, suggested by the                  
              interested member companies of the Material Handling Research                  
              Center of Georgia Tech, using above guidelines; 3.) conducting                 
              experiments in part recognition and handling using an IBM robot,               
              IBM AT, and Georgia Tech's Landmark Tracking Camera with                       
              retroreflective vision sensing; and 4.) developing preliminary                 
              metrics to compare alternate designs of a part on the basis of                 
              recognizability and cycle time for handling by going through the               
              iterative procedure of guidelines, design, test and metrics.                   
                   The researcher is competent and has the facilities available              
              to perform the research.                                                       
                   The Program Manager recommends Tuskegee University be awarded             
              $100,000 for two (2) years.
