              A joint workshop, to be held at the new Euler                                  
              International Mathematics Institute of the U.S.S.R.                            
              Academy of Sciences in Leningrad during the period                             
              May 13-26, 1991 will focus on two key areas of                                 
              interest in mathematics, complex analysis and                                  
              mathematical physics.  The meeting is being                                    
              organized by Dr. Edward Saff of the University of                              
              South Florida and Dr. A. A. Gonchar, Academician                               
              Secretary of the Department of Mathematics of the                              
              U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences.  Ten of the thirteen                             
              U.S. participants will receive partial or full                                 
              support from this award for travel to the                                      
              meeting.  Its results will be internationally                                  
              published.

              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                             
              researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R.                              
              to combine complementary efforts and capabilities                              
              in areas of strong mutual interest and competence                              
              in the field of basic scientific research on the                               
              basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
