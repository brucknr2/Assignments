Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Computer equipment will be purchased to enhance the existing              
              UNIDA TA program within the Atmospheric Science Department at                  
              Cornell University.  This award will allow the acquisition of a                
              powerful UNIX based workstation and a 386 based PC.  This                      
              equipment will be used primarily for data ingest and analysis.                 
              The UNIDATA suite of software will provide the Department with                 
              easy access to station data, satellite images and gridded                      
              analysis and forecasts from numerical models.  These data are                  
              used extensively in research and instruction within the                        
              Department and as input to an interactive access and display                   
              system, known as CLIMOD (CLimate Information for Management and                
              Operational Decisions).  In addition to enhancing the                          
              Department's capabilities, there is a need to reconfigure                      
              existing equipment and to acquire new equipment because UNIDATA                
              will no longer support or will continue to develop its software                
              for the VMS operating system.  The VMS operating system is the                 
              primary operating system used in the Department today.  Also, an               
              older PC is being replaced by a faster and more capable PC to                  
              allow the more effective use of McIDAS which is a UNIDATA                      
              supported software package.
