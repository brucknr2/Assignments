Abstract    :
              The need to identify cemented sand deposits and evaluate their                 
              engineering characteristics together with the difficulty in                    
              sampling such deposits require the use of insitu testing schemes.              
              Among different insitu testing schemes, cone penetration testing               
              is gaining wide acceptance and use in the nation.  This study will             
              investigate the effect of cementation on cone penetration testing.             
              Piezocone penetration tests will be conducted in a calibration                 
              chamber on saturated specimens of artificially cemented sands.  The            
              results obtained from the calibration chamber (experimental model)             
              will be compared with the predictions of available theoretical                 
              models and a new theoretical model that incorporates dilation.                 
              Using the predictions of these experimental and theoretical models,            
              a methodology will be formalized to identify cemented sand deposits            
              and evaluate their engineering characteristics.  The accuracy and              
              reliability of the developed scheme will be investigated by                    
              piezocone penetration testing at a site with well-documented                   
              naturally cemented sand deposits.
