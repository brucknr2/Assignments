Abstract    :
              This research investigates the utility of using demonstrational                
              techniques in user interfaces for computer programs.                           
              Demonstrational user interfaces provide concrete examples on                   
              which the user operates, rather than requiring the user to deal                
              with abstractions such as variables and control structures.  In                
              the demonstrational approach, the user provides examples and the               
              system infers how the examples would be generalized to create                  
              something that is more general purpose.  More successful                       
              approaches limit the inferences to a specific domain.  Two                     
              applications are chosen in this research.  One is text formatting              
              and the other is a visual shell to the UNIX operating system.  In              
              the second case, a macro system is created without using a                     
              programming language by a rule-based inference system.  The user               
              interacts with simple commands.  The system determines from the                
              user's actions how to construct more complicated commands given                
              also its knowledge about file and operating system details.  The               
              two applications are to be released to up to about 3000 subjects               
              providing evaluation of potential advantages and issues.  This                 
              research addresses issues relevant to broader programmatic goals               
              including making computer systems adapt to end users.
