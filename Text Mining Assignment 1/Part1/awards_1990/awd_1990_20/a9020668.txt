Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant will help fund the Fifth Copper Mountain Conference on              
              Multigrid Methods to be held March 31 through April 5, 1991.  The              
              topics of emphasis are hypersonic flow, adaptive methods, large                
              structures, transport processes, particle physics, parallel                    
              computation, and large-scale applications software.  These                     
              topics will be addressed by the invited speakers, in the special               
              sessions and the workshops, and by the panel.  Other sessions of               
              contributed papers will also be held.  In order to provide the                 
              novice with a basic understanding of multigrid and its                         
              processes, four one-hour introductory lectures on multigrid                    
              techniques will be offered the first morning of the conference.
