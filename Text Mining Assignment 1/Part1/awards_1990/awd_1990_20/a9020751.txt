Abstract    :
              This project aims to study the behavior of ferroelectric liquid                
              crystals in external magnetic and electric fields.  Experimental               
              techniques such as field-dependent light-scattering together with              
              electro- and magneto-optic and dielectric measurements will be used            
              to investigate the recently discovered nematic electroclinic                   
              effect, as well as a variety of related phenomena such as surface              
              interactions, molecular couplings, and critical phenomena.
