Abstract    :
              This conference on "Scanned Probe Microscopies:                                
              STM and Beyond" under the sponsorship of the                                   
              Engineering Foundation, will be held in Santa                                  
              Barbara, CA, from 6-11 January 1991.  The                                      
              invention of the Scanning Tunneling Microscope                                 
              has revolutionized surface science, by providing                               
              atomic resolution images of surfaces.  It has also                             
              stimulated the development of a family of new                                  
              microscopies based on the same approach:                                       
              piezoelectrically-driven scanning of a probe tip over                          
              a surface with nanometer/angstrom precision.  By                               
              utilizing different physical interactions between                              
              probe tip and sample, these new scanned probe                                  
              microscopes have demonstrated a range of physical                              
              measurements, from topography and magnetic                                     
              imaging to atomic-scale friction and optical imaging,                          
              all with unprecedented resolution.                                             
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this conference are: (1) To bring                            
              together a select group of people from diverse                                 
              disciplines, not only those in the forefront of                                
              development of these microscopies, and those who                               
              have pioneered in their application of various fields,                         
              but also others whose research interests lie in areas                          
              of potential application; (2) To provide a                                     
              conference format (a series of plenary sessions                                
              interspersed with time for informal discussion)                                
              which has proved successful, both in previous                                  
              Engineering Foundation conferences and in the                                  
              Gordon Conferences, in promoting synergistic                                   
              interactions; and thereby (3) To simulate new                                  
              directions in scanned probe microscopies and                                   
              techniques, both in applications and in the                                    
              underlying technologies.
