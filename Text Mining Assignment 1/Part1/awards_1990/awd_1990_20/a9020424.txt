Abstract    :
                   This award enables Merrimack College to connect to NSFNET by              
              a 9,600 bit per second link through the mid-level network                      
              NEARnet. Access to NSFNET provides the faculty and students with               
              access to supercomputers, data archives, a variety of network                  
              gateways, automated library catalogs, and a wide range of                      
              software.  Primary applications include file transfers,                        
              electronic mail communication between local and remote                         
              researchers, and remote login to and use of supercomputers and                 
              other research facilities.
