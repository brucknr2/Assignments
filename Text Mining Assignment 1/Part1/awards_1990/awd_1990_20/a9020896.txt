Abstract    :
               This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                     
              continuing work of Dr. Josef Michl at the University of Colorado.              
              This work will provide new insights into the nature of short-lived             
              intermediates that are formed in the course of chemical reactions              
              and will also develop new approaches to chemical measurements                  
              using a "molecular-size construction set."                                     
                                                                                             
              The experiments that will be carried out by Dr. Michl fall into                
              two categories. The first is focused on biradical intermediates,               
              which will be generated by photolytic or pyrolytic processes and               
              than be trapped in a low-temperature, inert-gas matrix.                        
              Electronic and vibrational spectroscopic studies will afford an                
              improved understanding of the structure and reactivity of these                
              unstable species. The second category is centered on Michl's                   
              staffane hydrocarbons, which are rod-like molecules made up of                 
              recurring bicyclo ?1.1.0! pentane subunits. These "molecular                   
              Tinkertoys" provide a unique opportunity for studying the                      
              transmission of electronic effects through a molecular framework.              
                                                                                             
              Professor Michl will also take advantage of the linear shape of                
              these molecules to link these molecules together and form                      
              supramolecular assemblies with well-defined molecular structures.
