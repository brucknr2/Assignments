Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports an ethnohistorian studying social identity               
              and boundary maintenance in colonial societies by means of an                  
              intensive study of a colonized indigenous elite in central Mexico              
              in the 17th and 18th centuries.  The importance of class and                   
              status hierarchies are hypothesized to vary directly with the                  
              degree of elite market integration and external coercion.                      
              Increasing preoccupation with noble status in late colonial times              
              will be related to the economic activities of the villagers,                   
              coercive policies of state Spanish officials and the nature of                 
              hacienda labor relations.  Date for the study will come from                   
              colonial documents in Spanish and Nahuatl (the Aztec language)                 
              located in Mexico and in Seville, Spain.                                       
                                                                                             
              This research contributes to our knowledge of colonial societies               
              by untangling the complex relations among state coercion, market               
              forces, social inequality,and social boundaries in a single                    
              community.  The comparative focus should enhance our                           
              understanding of community structure and its regional variation                
              in Mexico.
