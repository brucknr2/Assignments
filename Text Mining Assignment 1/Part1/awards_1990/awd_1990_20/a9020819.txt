Abstract    :
              BB1 is a software system (knowledge representation, interpreter,               
              and system-building tools) for building artificial intelligence                
              (AI) systems. It embodies a model called the "dynamic control                  
              architecture," in which an AI system incrementally constructs                  
              explicit solutions to problems, integrates diverse sources of                  
              knowledge, and dynamically constructs and modifies explicit                    
              control plans to guide its reasoning. Previous versions of BB1                 
              have been licensed to over 100 academic, government, and                       
              industrial organizations. BB1 version 2.5 introduces new                       
              featuresthat allow an AI system to: integrate asynchronous                     
              perception, reasoning, and action processes; dynamically control               
              perception; reason about temporal phenomena; and guarantee                     
              response times. These innovations are especially useful for                    
              research and applications involving dynamic task environments and              
              real-time constraints, for example, intelligent agents, medical                
              monitoring, intelligent tutoring, control of manufacturing                     
              processes, and control of autonomous vehicles.  This project                   
              supports distribution of BB1 version 2.5 to others in the                      
              research community. Activities include: software upgrading,                    
              testing, and debugging; development of demonstration systems;                  
              preparation of installation instructions and a user manual;                    
              distribution of software; and documentation of users and                       
              applications.
