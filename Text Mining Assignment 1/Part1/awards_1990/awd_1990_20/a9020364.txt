Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  Under this project support is provided for                       
              participation of four U.S. scientists in the Indo- U.S.                        
              Symposium on Neuroceptor Transduction Mechanisms, planned                      
              for January 23 to 28, 1991 at the All India Institute of                       
              Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, India.  The main                        
              topic of the symposium will be the receptor-mediated signal                    
              transductions which are one of the important events in                         
              nervous system function.  New advances which were recently                     
              made regarding the structure, function and regulation of                       
              G-proteins in nervous system will be examined.  The meeting                    
              is planned to integrate specific presentations, by means of                    
              discussions and workshops, so that a synthesis of recent                       
              advances can be made.  The chairman of the Indian                              
              organizing committee is Dr.A. Sharma.                                          
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This symposium is the 4th in the Indo-U.S.                             
              neuroscience series.  These bilateral meetings are oriented                    
              to exchanges of information and presentations of data                          
              relavent to recent advances in fundamental mechanistic                         
              neurobiology.  The proposed meeting will help nurture the                      
              growth of neurosciences in India and identify emerging                         
              areas where useful collaborative research can be started.                      
              The area of the meeting is of major current interest in the                    
              U.S. and the meeting is likely to help the field in the                        
              U.S. as well as in India.
