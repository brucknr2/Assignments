Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Anthropologists have long been interested by the history of human              
              populations.  South Pacific populations have been a problem area               
              in terms of developing a consensus about the migrations of people              
              into the area - the timing of migrations, the relationships                    
              between populations, the rates of evolutionary change and the                  
              like.  With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, there are                
              potentials for new approaches to these long-standing problems.                 
                                                                                             
              Stoneking proposes to isolate various components of the DNA from               
              several hundred humans representing four broad areas - New                     
              Guinea, Australia, Indonesia and Samoa.  Data on DNA sequences                 
              and hybridization with oligonucleotide probes will allow the                   
              comparisons of these groups at the genetic level.  With the use                
              of statistical and computer techniques, it will be possible to                 
              clarify the relationships between the groups and thus help to                  
              resolve the peopling of the South Pacific.                                     
                                                                                             
              Both mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA will be analyzed.  A                
              particularly interesting aspect will be Stoneking's analysis of                
              variable sequences on the Y chromosome.  Mitochondrial DNA is                  
              inherited through the maternal line while Y chromosomes are                    
              passed through the paternal line.  As much debate exists                       
              regarding interpretations of mtDNA evolution, this data will                   
              allow especially interesting investigations.
