Abstract    :
              This workshop will provide a forum for US and German                           
              researchers to discuss recent advances in protein                              
              purification, new advances and concepts in chromatographic                     
              separation, membrane associated recovery processes and                         
              equipment design for downstream processing. The workshop                       
              is to be held at the Gesellschaft fuer Biotechnologische                       
              Forschung (GBF), Braunschweig, Germany, during October,                        
              1991.  A total of 13 U.S. participants, 8 from                                 
              universities and 5 from industry, has been planned.  Equal                     
              participation from Germany is anticipated.
