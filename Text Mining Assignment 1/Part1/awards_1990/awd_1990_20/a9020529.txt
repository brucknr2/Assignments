Abstract    :
                   Atom-atom collisions, in the projectile energy range between              
              10 and 600 keV are studied.  Electron ejection cross sections                  
              will be measured for 10-300 keV protons incident on atomic                     
              hydrogen.  Fundamental properties of inelastic atom-molecule                   
              collisions are studied by means of polarized photon scattered                  
              particle coincidence techniques.  Long-range correlation effects               
              of Coulomb-interacting H+ + H- + H+ are studied using 3-particle               
              coincidence techniques.  K and L shell x-ray production will be                
              studied to test theories of inner shell ionization by low energy               
              electrons. The results of these experimental investigations are                
              compared with predictions of theoretical models, and may be used               
              directly to model processes in high temperature plasmas.
