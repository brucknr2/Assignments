Abstract    :
              A workshop will be held to bring together leading mathematicians and           
              experts in the development of symbolic software.  The goal of the              
              workshop will be to identify areas of mathematical research which              
              would benefit from improvements in symbolic software, to discuss the           
              form that new software should take, and to explore the possibility of          
              setting up a multi-national development project to produce symbolic            
              software needed for mathematical research.  The workshop will focus            
              primarily, but not exclusively, on research in such fields of algebra          
              as number theory, group theory, algebraic geometry, and commutative            
              algebra.  The workshop is in part a response to recommendations in a           
              recent report to the NSF urging increased activity in the field of             
              symbolic computation.
