Abstract    :
              Meharry Medical College is one of five small Nashville institutions            
              which Vanderbilt University is assisting in connecting to NSFNET.              
              The 56,000 bit per second connection is made through the mid-level             
              network SURANET using the SURANET connection Vanderbilt has had for            
              two years.  Two of the institutions are historically black, two are            
              small liberal arts institutions that emphasize teaching rather than            
              research, and one is a two-year technological school.  Meharry is              
              one of the historically black institutions.  Benefits of the NSFNET            
              connection include file transfers, electronic mail communication               
              between local and remote researchers, and remote login to and use              
              of supercomputers and other research facilities.  In addition, the             
              local institutions have access to Vanderbilt's resources, and add              
              another dimension to the diversity of resources Vanderbilt can                 
              offer its students.  Cross-registration, software sharing and other            
              benefits also result from the network.
