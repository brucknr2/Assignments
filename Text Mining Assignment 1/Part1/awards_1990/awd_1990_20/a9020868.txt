Abstract    :
              Transport ATPases play a central role in the bioenergetics of all              
              living cells.  In the past we have shown that the F-(eubacterial)              
              and V-type (eukaryotic and archaebacterial) ATPases are very useful            
              molecular markers for early organismal evolution.  The proposed                
              research aims to extend the use of the nuclear encoded ATPAse                  
              subunits to the early radiation of eukaryotes (especially                      
              flagellates and algae) and to the evolution of land plants.  Parts             
              of the genes encoding the catalytic subunits of V-type ATPASes will            
              be amplified directly from the genomic or cDNA of various organisms            
              using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  The obtained sequences             
              will be used to determine the phylogenetic relations between these             
              organisms, including evaluations of the significance of the derived            
              branching patterns.
