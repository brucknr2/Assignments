Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for a project to                           
              determine conditions under which the performance of a                          
              wastewater biological treatment process is adversely                           
              affected by loss of plasmids that are encoded for                              
              wastewater constituents during their temporary absence                         
              from the wastewater stream.  The investigator plans to                         
              conduct both batch and continuous culture experiments                          
              using tolualdehyde (degraded by plasmid-encoded enzymes),                      
              benzoate (degraded by plasmid- or chromosomally-encoded                        
              enzymes), and  lysine (degraded by chromosomally-encoded                       
              enzymes), singly and in pairs to determine how the nature                      
              of the substrate and the specific growth rate of the                           
              culture influence the rate constants that describe plasmid                     
              loss.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              Knowledge of factors that control the rate at which                            
              plasmids are lost will permit the engineering design of                        
              treatment systems to minimize their loss and otherwise                         
              compensate for it. This knowledge will also beneficially                       
              affect the operating efficiency of existing wastewater                         
              treatment plants that depend on biological processes for                       
              their operation.
