Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this travel grant is to allow Dr. Harvey                        
              Nichols of the University of Colorado's Institute of Arctic                    
              and Alpine Research to attend an international symposium on                    
              boreal forests in Arkhangel'sk, U.S.S.R.  The meeting,                         
              sponsored by the U.S.S.R. State Committee on Forests, is part                  
              of a larger project on detection of biosphere response to                      
              global change that has been organized under the auspices of                    
              the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis.                       
              During his visit, which will include site visits to boreal                     
              forest sites along the Barents Sea, Dr. Nichols will also                      
              evaluate opportunities for sustained U.S.-Soviet cooperative                   
              research on long-term monitoring of ecological change at high                  
              latitudes.
