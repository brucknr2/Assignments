Abstract    :
              In this project in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program                
              of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Holcombe will use graphite                    
              furnaces to study means of improving trace metals analysis, and                
              also to study gas/solid interactions.  Graphite furnace methods                
              are already among the most sensitive available for detecting                   
              trace metals in biological and environmental systems, and                      
              Holcombe's work will improve the reliability and generality of                 
              the approach.  Theoretical calculations will aid in                            
              understanding the chemical and physical processes occurring.                   
                                                                                             
              Among the novel features of the research, Holcombe will use                    
              temperature-programmed static secondary ionization mass                        
              spectrometry to characterize the furnace surface as first                      
              solvent, then the analytical species are vaporized.  Spectral                  
              interpretation and collection of basic surface kinetics data                   
              will be emphasized.  Monte Carlo calculations of gaseous                       
              dynamics will be carried out on a supercomputer to couple the                  
              fundamental data to predictions of analytical signal behavior.                 
              If successful, inexpensive methods for ultratrace                              
              quantification will be at hand, which will compete in                          
              performance with the much more expensive plasma/mass                           
              spectrometric techniques now in use.
