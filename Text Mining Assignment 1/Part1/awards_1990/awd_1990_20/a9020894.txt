Abstract    :
              International cooperative research is very beneficial in                       
              the stimulation of research program ideas as well as in                        
              the sharing of costs and research results.  In addition,                       
              duplication of research is avoided, saving time and money.                     
              A meeting held in December 1989 in England, between                            
              representatives of the Department of Technology and                            
              Industry in the United Kingdom and the National Science                        
              Foundation indicated a strong interest on both sides to                        
              conduct cooperative research projects in ocean                                 
              engineering.  Workshops conducted in selected research                         
              areas would then lead to cooperative proposals in these                        
              ocean engineering areas.  The subject area for possible                        
              cooperation include, Autonomous underwater vehicles and                        
              subsea robotics technology.                                                    
                                                                                             
              It is proposed that a workshop be held at Florida Atlantic                     
              University in the United States in the Spring of 1990.                         
              The workshop will be four days long plus one or two days                       
              for faculty visits.  Invited papers on selected topics                         
              would be presented on the first day of the workshop.
