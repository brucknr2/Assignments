Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a study, both theoretical and observational,               
              of the dynamics which produce warps in galactic planes.  Galaxies              
              with polar rings will also be studied to place additional                      
              constraints on the distribution of dark matter in these systems.               
              The principal investigator is one of the world leaders in this                 
              field, and the combination of new observations with her analytical             
              skills should lead to new insights in how galaxies operate.
