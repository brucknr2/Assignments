Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr.                       
              Lerner's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support                 
              of his research at Oregon State University.  The thrust of Dr.                 
              Lerner's research is the synthesis of highly oxidized graphite                 
              fluorides by novel chemical routes.                                            
                                                                                             
              The synthesis to be examined will not employ elemental fluorine                
              as an oxidant. Instead, powerful, but convenient, oxidants such                
              as Mn(VII) and Cr(VI) in combination with solutions containing                 
              small, readily-intercalated ions such as fluoride or bifluoride                
              will be utilized. These reactions can be carried out under                     
              ambient conditions in aqueous acid solvents. A variation will                  
              be to employ graphite salts such as those of stable                            
              fluorometallate or oxometallate anions rather than graphite as                 
              a starting material. The structural, electronic and                            
              electrochemical properties of the graphite fluorides will be                   
              examined by X-ray diffraction, 4-probe conductivity                            
              measurements, vibrational spectroscopy and coulometric                         
              reduction.
