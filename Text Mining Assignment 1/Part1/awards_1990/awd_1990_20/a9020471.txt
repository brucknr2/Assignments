Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the development and testing of a novel                
              optical instrument for determining night sky clarity. A                        
              modulated Ronchi grating will provide a modulated output that is               
              sensitive to sky clarity when  a wide field of stars is observed.              
              This output can be used to determine whether the sky is                        
              sufficiently clear to conduct observations of faint night sky                  
              emission lines. It is expected that this instrument will be                    
              especially useful for operations from remote sites, or from sites              
              operated by personnel inexperienced in judging whether conditions              
              are suitable for observations. Reproduction of the developed                   
              instrument is expected to be inexpensive, and its widespread                   
              application is foreseen.
