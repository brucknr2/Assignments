Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Glenn              
              Radice of Columbia University to conduct collaborative research with           
              Dr. Masatoshi Takeichi of Kyoto University, Japan.  Dr. Radice will            
              spend one year working at Dr. Takeichi's lab in Japan, investigating           
              the role of N-cadherin in embryogenesis.  The cadherins are cell-              
              surface proteins responsible for cell-cell adhesions.  Spatial                 
              segregation of cells differentiating into distinct lineages during             
              embryonic development requires selective intercellular adhesions.              
              This study will investigate the molecular basis for selective cell             
              adhesion during embryogenesis.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Dr. Radice's background is in mammalian developmental genetics and Dr.         
              Takeichi is a recognized leader in the field of cellular adhesion.             
              This work should provide critical information for the understanding            
              of mammalian morphogenesis.
