Abstract    :
                   A program of experimental investigations is carried out on                
              ion-atom collisions in which the projectile (ion) is left with                 
              two of its electrons moving with near zero velocity in the                     
              projectile frame of reference, barely bound to the ion.  These                 
              studies will provide information about various aspects of the                  
              three-body Coulomb problem, an area of current active interest.
