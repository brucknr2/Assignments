Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new state-of-the-art, electrical discharge machine (EDM)                     
              will be purchased to test recently published theoretical                       
              results via computer simulation for matching advanced                          
              materials such as ceramics.  A recent scientific                               
              breakthrough with our plasma spark model explains for the                      
              first time how EDM machines actually erode the cathode and                     
              anode surfaces - release of the high plasma pressure causes                    
              the superheated cathode and anode melt cavities to explode                     
              into the cold, liquid dielectric.  The requested desk-top                      
              EDM is the first designed specifically for research                            
              experiments.  Its small dielectric bath (4 liters) allows                      
              testing of numerous new liquids - water or a hydrocarbon                       
              oil is normally used but the spark model predicts that                         
              higher density dielectrics will provide faster machining.                      
              The gap sensor and generator respond in 10 nanoseconds (10-                    
              8 seconds) to input and process conditions, allowing                           
              precise tests of the effects of electrical pulses of                           
              various shapes - e.g., rectangular, triangular, sinusoidal.
