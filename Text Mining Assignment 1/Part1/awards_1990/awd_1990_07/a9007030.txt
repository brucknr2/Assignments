Abstract    :
                   The main objectives of the research planned is the analysis               
              of large scale structured computational problems and of                        
              the convergence of parallel iterative methods for solving linear               
              systems.  More specifically: (i) Estimation of condition numbers               
              of structured maps.  (ii) Round-off error analysis of algorithms               
              specially tailored for solving structured computational problems.              
              (iii) Applications of these techniques to the solution of large                
              sparse and dense structured systems of linear equations and                    
              integral equations as well as to other structured computational                
              problems.  (iv) Analysis of convergence and acceleration                       
              synchronous and asynchronous iteration algorithms for solving                  
              large sparse systems of linear equations and their                             
              implementations on respective SIMD and MIMD parallel computer                  
              architectures.
