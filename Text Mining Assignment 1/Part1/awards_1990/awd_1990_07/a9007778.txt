Abstract    :
              This is a Research Equipment Grant in the area of power electronics.           
              The work which will be impacted by the grant is in the modelling,              
              design, and control of brushless motor drive systems.  The specific            
              project relates to the real time digital control of a brushless                
              machine.  It is expected that the equipment will permit an improved            
              actuation method for torque control based on integral manifold                 
              techniques.  The digital equipment permits capability for digital              
              measurement of torque, and inductance as well as electrical states.
