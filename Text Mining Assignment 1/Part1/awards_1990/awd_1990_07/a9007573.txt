Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Food intake, appetitie and body weight  are controlled by                 
              the brain through an interaction with peripheral signals.  This                
              interaction is complex and poorly understood even though it is of              
              obvious importance.  Recently it has been discovered that  a                   
              peptide in the brain, neuropeptide Y, induces feeding when                     
              injected into specific nuclei of the hypothalamus.  The                        
              hypothesis of the proposal is that glucose raises insulin which                
              acts in the hypothalamus to inhibit the peptide and when glucose               
              levels are low, the reduced insulin triggers increased                         
              neuropeptide Y which stimulates feeding.  The test of these                    
              hypotheses and the rate at which such changes occur can be                     
              measured most accurately by studying the regulation of mRNA                    
              expression in situ.  This will show where and how much                         
              neuropeptide Y is formed and under what conditions.
