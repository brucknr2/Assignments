Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this proposal the PI seeks an image analysis system with                    
              associated software for automatic analysis of images of                        
              various liquid-liquid and solid in liquid particulate                          
              dispersions.  In several outlined related projects the image                   
              analysis will include the analysis of size and shape of                        
              particles, fractal structure of the dispersion, particularly                   
              near the point of complete coalescence or phase inversion, and                 
              so on.  Such analysis will be crucial input to a theoretical                   
              framework which seeks to use fractal-theories concepts in                      
              conjunction with scaling ideas to characterize the behavior of                 
              dense coalescing dispersions, and address the problem of has                   
              inversion.  In a second project the image analysis of polymer                  
              particles is designed to investigate the effectiveness of a                    
              novel technique of preparing non-spherical polymer particles                   
              of precisely controlled sizes and shapes for a variety of                      
              fundamental and practical applications.                                        
                                                                                             
              The proposed image analysis system with its capability for                     
              automatic analysis meets most adequately the requirements of                   
              fast image processing of large volumes of images obtained                      
              photographically and by a video recorder in our research.  It                  
              also facilities direct transmission of data to a mainframe                     
              computer for the data processing required for the solution of                  
              critical inverse problems.
