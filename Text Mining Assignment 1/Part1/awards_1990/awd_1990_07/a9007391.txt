Abstract    :
                   The objective of the planned research is to examine whether               
              there is evidence, reflected in DNA sequences, that natural                    
              selection has played a role in the long term evolutionary                      
              persistence of two mutant enzyme variants.  As a model system                  
              that study focuses on the essential metabolic enzyme, glucose-6-               
              phosphate dehydrogenase, in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster.                  
              Earlier studies indicated that there are significant differences               
              in the biochemical propoerties associated with the  common                     
              genetic variants, but it is not clear if these differences                     
              contribute to the long-term evolutionary fate of the polymorphism              
              in natural populations.  Current advances in the mathematical                  
              theory of DNA sequence evolution predict very specific patterns                
              will be associated with genetic polymorphism that have been                    
              maintained in populations for long periods of time because of                  
              natural selection.  This model system presents the opportunity to              
              apply this new theory.  Such studies are essential if we are to                
              understand the forces that effect the genetic variation which is               
              ubiquitous in natural populations of all species, including                    
              humans, and it will also help us to understand the forces shaping              
              DNA sequence variation.
