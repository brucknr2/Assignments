Abstract    :
              Nitrate assimilation is the predominant pathway within the                     
              biosphere for acquisition  of inorganic nitrogen.  In the lower                
              eukaryotic Neurospora crassa, nitrate assimilation is an                       
              inducible metabolic pathway consisting of two enzymes, nitrate                 
              reductase and nitrite reductase.  Biochemical studies reveal that              
              the expression of both enzymes is induced by nitrate, and both                 
              are repressed by the end product, ammonium, of primary products                
              of ammonium assimilation such as glutamine.  This latter effect,               
              termed nitrogen metabolite repression, is dominant in that                     
              nitrate assimilation is essentially precluded by ammonium.  To                 
              date, nine genes are implicated in nitrate assimilation.  Two of               
              them, nit-3 and nit-6, are coordinately controlled, unlinked                   
              structural genes encoding the enzymes, nitrate reductase and                   
              nitrite reductase, respectively.  Four genes, nit-1,7, 8 and 9,                
              function in producing the molybdenum cofactor essential to                     
              nitrate reductase.  Three genes serve regulatory  roles: nit-4 is              
              required for nitrate induction of the nitrate  assimilatory                    
              pathway, whereas nit-2 and nmr-1 have pleiotropic effects                      
              controlling many secondary pathways of nitrogen acquisition, e.g.              
              amino acid oxidation or purine catabolism, which like nitrate                  
              assimilation, provide for nitrogen nutrition in the absence of                 
              available ammonium.  Genes nit-2,3 and 4, as well nmr-1, have                  
              been cloned.  This research undertakes cloning and analysis of                 
              nit-6, the nitrite reductase structural gene, and comparison of                
              its sequence organization to nit-3, its coordinately regulated                 
              partner.  Further, a molecular strategy has revealed additional                
              nitrate regulated genes for genetic and biochemical                            
              characterization.
