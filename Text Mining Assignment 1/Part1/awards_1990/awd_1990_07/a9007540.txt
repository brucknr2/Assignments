Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Analytical an numerical studies will be undertaken in the general              
              area of the dynamics of classical and quantum spin systems.                    
              Specific attention will be focussed on quantum manifestations of               
              Hamiltonian chaos; one- and two-dimensional quantum                            
              antiferromagnetism at zero and nonzero temperatures as it relates              
              to high temperature superconductors; and, anomalous spin                       
              diffusion in classical Heisenberg ferromagnets as it relates to                
              the transport of spin fluctuations in quantum and classical spin               
              models at high temperatures.
