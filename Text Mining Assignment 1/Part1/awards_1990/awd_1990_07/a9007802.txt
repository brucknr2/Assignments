Abstract    :
                   With this award the principal investigator will use                       
              analytical and numerical tools to study the long-time behavior                 
              of solutions of certain dissipative partial differential                       
              equations such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the                    
              Navier-Stokes equations.  Of particular interest is the                        
              approximation of a set called the global attractor, which is a                 
              finite-dimensional, fractal set that lies inside of an infinite-               
              dimensional phase space.  In order to describe the global                      
              attractor the principal investigators plan to construct an                     
              algebraic approximation method that uses smooth finite-                        
              dimensional manifolds to approximate the fractal set and then to               
              implement this method on a computer.                                           
                   From an abstract point of view one can regard the solutions               
              of a partial differential equation as generating a space of                    
              trajectories or curves that is infinite-dimensional.  This is one              
              reason why the study of such equations is difficult.                           
              Fortunately, though, within this infinite-dimensional space                    
              reside sets of finite dimension that characterize how solutions                
              behave for very large times.  And since these sets are finite-                 
              dimensional, it is possible to describe them approximately using               
              numerical and analytical techniques.  With this award the                      
              researchers will study finite-dimensional objects called global                
              attractors that arise in the solution sets of equations from                   
              fluid dynamics.
