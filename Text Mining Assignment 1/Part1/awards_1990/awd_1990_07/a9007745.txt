Abstract    :
              It is proposed to assemble a flexible ultra-                                   
              high vacuum (UHV) chamber for in-situ etching                                  
              and cleaning of III-V heterostructures by a                                    
              variety of techniques, including a unique                                      
              damage-free supersonic beam process under                                      
              development by the principal investigator in                                   
              collaboration with colleagues in the                                           
              Department of Chemistry and Chemical                                           
              Engineering.  The chamber, which is to be                                      
              attached to an existing molecular beam epitaxy                                 
              system, will be used by the principal                                          
              investigator and his colleagues in the                                         
              Department of Electrical Engineering and                                       
              Computer Science research on high performance                                  
              electronic, opto-electronic, photonic, and                                     
              quantum devices and integrated systems.  In                                    
              addition to being designed for etching and                                     
              cleaning inside the UHV environment, this                                      
              system is designed to enable researchers to                                    
              mask, etch, pattern, and/or otherwise process                                  
              III-V heterostructures outside the growth                                      
              system; to return them to the UHV growth                                       
              environment; and to then clean, etch, and                                      
              prepare their surfaces for further MBE growth.                                 
              It furthermore includes provision to coat the                                  
              prepared surfaces with arsenic to protect them                                 
              from contamination during subsequent transfer                                  
              and storage within the multi-chamber growth                                    
              system, as well as during removal from the                                     
              system.
