Abstract    :
              Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate                   
              structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of                 
              a vast array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic                         
              molecules.  When combined with gas chromatography (GC), the                    
              resulting GC/MS affords the chemist one of the most powerful                   
              tools available for the separation and characterization of                     
              compounds.  The acquisition of GC/MS is essential for the                      
              prosecution of frontier research in many fields of chemistry.                  
                                                                                             
              The Department of Chemistry at the Wake Forest University will                 
              use this award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to                    
              help acquire a GC/MS system.  The areas of chemical research                   
              that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the following:                
                                                                                             
              1)  Synthesis and Reaction Chemistry of Transition-Metal S2O                   
                   Complexes.                                                                
                                                                                             
              2)  Carbenoid Chemistry/Natural Synthesis.                                     
                                                                                             
              3)  Evaluation of the Feasibility, Applications, and Scope of                  
                   Cloud Point Extractions.                                                  
                                                                                             
              4)  Chemistry of N-Alkyl-N-Nitro-Nitrosoguanidines and Alkane                  
                   and Benzyl Diazotates.
