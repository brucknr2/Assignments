Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research equipment award will be used to purchase a fully                 
              automated image analysis system for use in studying geotechnical               
              materials (soil and rock), as well as other civil engineering                  
              materials.  The microstructures of these materials will be studied;            
              for example pore structure, grain contacts, grain orientations and             
              grain defects.
