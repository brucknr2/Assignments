Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Over the past 25 years, advances in the biological sciences have               
                                                                                             
              resulted in dramatic improvements in the understanding of                      
              biological processes, especially at the molecular level.                       
              However, great opportunities also exist in plant science                       
              research.  Because of the great research opportunities in the                  
              plant sciences, the National Academy of Sciences - National                    
              Research Council propose to conduct a five-month study to provide              
                                                                                             
              a general assessment of plant science research and funding                     
              programs in the United States and make recommendations on how                  
              they can be strengthened.
