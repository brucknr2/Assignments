Abstract    :
              In this project ("Structures and Reactions of New Main-Group                   
              Organometallic Compounds") funded by the Organic Dynamics                      
              Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Herman G. Richey                  
              in the Chemistry Department at Pennsylvania State University                   
              will investigate the structures and reactions of new                           
              organometallic species of main-group elements.  The study will                 
              also involve preparation of new organometallics and generating                 
              a new species of more reactive organomagnesium compounds.                      
                                                                                             
              This project will be concerned with the preparation and study                  
              of species formed from organomagnesium compounds by additions                  
              of crown ethers or simple salts, such as alkali metal alkoxides                
              and tetraalkylammonium halides.  These new species, which                      
              include coordinated organomagnesium cations, threaded                          
              organomagnesium-crown ethers, and various organomagnesiate                     
              anions, are considerably more reactive than conventional                       
              organomagnesium compounds, and with some substrates afford                     
              different products.  The scope  and mechanisms of their                        
              reactions with ketones and other reactions will be studied.                    
              Similar investigations of organozincate anions formed from                     
              organozinc compounds and salts will also be performed.
