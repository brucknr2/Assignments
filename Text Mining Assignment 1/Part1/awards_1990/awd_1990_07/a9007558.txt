Abstract    :
              Four argon ion lasers are the primary source of energy for femtosecond         
              laser research in our laboratories, as well as for numerous                    
              instructional graduate experiments.  Each of these lasers have an              
              annual usage in excess of 3,000 hours, which exceeds the lifetime of           
              these older type laser tubes, predating the metal-ceramic technology,          
              and therefore, each laser requires an annual tube replacement.  This           
              Research Equipment Grant is for a conversion of the two spectra                
              physics 171 argon laser to the 2030T-20 metal-ceramic laser head, and          
              replacement of a smaller laser by a single 2020 5W argon ion laser.            
              These lasers will continue to be used for pumping femtosecond dye              
              lasers, a parametric oscillator, and serve as primary source for 9             
              instructional experiments.  The main thrust of the research is                 
              nonlinear optics of thin films and interfaces.
