Abstract    :
              Interest in glycoproteins arises from their central role in                    
              biological recognition and their highly specific                               
              antigenicity.  A series of cyclic glycopeptides will be                        
              synthesized and their structural characteristics determined                    
              using circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared                           
              spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.                      
              The nature of the interaction between the peptide backbone of                  
              the protein and the carbohydrate will be investigated.  These                  
              studies should enlarge our knowledge of glycoprotein                           
              specificity and the role of glycoproteins antigenicity and                     
              other biological recognition phenomena.
