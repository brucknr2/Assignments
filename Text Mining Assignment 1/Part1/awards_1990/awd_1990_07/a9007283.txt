Abstract    :
              In this project within the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                 
              metallic Chemistry Program, J.H. Espenson and A. Bakac of Iowa                 
              State University will continue their investigations of the                     
              reactivity of transition metal moieties bonded to oxygen.                      
              The study of the activation of dioxygen and its reactivity has                 
              practical relevance in many areas such as the transport and                    
              storage of oxygen in biological systems as well as the                         
              catalytic oxidations in organic synthesis.                                     
                                                                                             
              Complexes of cobalt(II) and chromium(II) with the ancillary                    
              ligand "cyclam" (a macrocyclic compound with four nitrogen                     
              donor atoms) will be employed in kinetic studies, using laser                  
              flash photolysis, of the uptake of dioxygen. The kinetics of                   
              the reactivity, via both electron transfer and oxygen atom                     
              transfer, of the dioxygen derivatives of these complexes will                  
              be investigated. In addition the reaction kinetics of peroxo                   
              complexes of cobalt(II), chromium(II) and several other metals                 
              will be examined.
