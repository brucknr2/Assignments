Abstract    :
              This research equipment award is made to partially fund the                    
              purchase of a ruby laser and related accessories that will be used             
              to improve our understanding of quasi-brittle materials under                  
              impact loads.  It is hoped that these studies will also lead to a              
              link between microscopic issues and macroscopic engineering                    
              behavior.
