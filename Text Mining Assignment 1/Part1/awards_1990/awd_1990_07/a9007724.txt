Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Demoic acid, a potent neurotoxin, has been isolated from the                   
              diatom species Nitzschia pungens (phytoplankton) under certain                 
              environmental conditions, particularly silica depletion. When                  
              this species is ingested by shellfish, it is concentrated and                  
              represents a neurological hazard to any human who consumes them.               
              This phenomenon was brought to the awareness of the public during              
              an episode of poisonings in Prince Edward Island, Canada after                 
              eating mussels. This recent linkage of demoic acid with shellfish              
              poisoning ( within the last two years) is of particular concern                
              since the diatom Nitzschia pungens  var. multiseries is a                      
              ubiquitous species thriving in many of our coastal waters. Dr.                 
              Fryxel has succeded in cloning the organism both from the                      
              Canadian bloom as well as from Galveston Bay. Because there is                 
              virtually nothing known about the regulation of the toxin                      
              production in this species especially with regard to life cycle                
              stages, it is critical that the cycles of demoic acid production               
              be worked out.
