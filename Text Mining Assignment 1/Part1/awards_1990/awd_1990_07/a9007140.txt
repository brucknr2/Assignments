Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigators request an autoclave with clean                    
              steam, which is essential to aseptic culture without                           
              harmful residues from house steam; two biosafety hoods to                      
              protect workers when transformed cells are being used; and                     
              an electronic particle counter which is essential for                          
              rapidly monitoring growth kinetics and cell size.                              
                                                                                             
              Examples of projects to be supported by the requested                          
              equipment are: 1) development of improved bioreactors and                      
              operating strategies for production of proteins and                            
              insecticides from the insect cell-baculovirus system; 2)                       
              testing of mathematical models that predict responses in                       
              cellular physiology to alterations in culture conditions;                      
              3) development of cell-culture analogs to pharmokinetic                        
              models for the purpose of improved risk assessment with                        
              respect to potentially toxic chemicals; 4) model studies                       
              on the dynamics of receptor-mediated cell adhesion; 5)                         
              development ofan experimental model of cell adhesion to                        
              blood vessels to preventmetastasis or the spread of tumor                      
              cells from one organ within the body, using metastatic cell                    
              lines; and 6) the development of biomaterials for culture                      
              of attachment-dependent cell lines to improve bioreactor                       
              performance.
