Abstract    :
              Matching funds will support acquisition of a chemical vapor                    
              deposition system for study of diamond films and coatings.                     
              The relationship between fundamental processing parameters,                    
              substrate adherence, and tribological performance will be                      
              studied in detail with the goal of optimizing the                              
              tribological properties.
