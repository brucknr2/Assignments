Abstract    :
              The goal of the Rewrite Rule Machine (RRM) project at SRI                      
              International is to design, simulate, test and build an extremely high         
              performance, multigrain, hierarchical, general purpose parallel                
              computer, that can ease writing and porting parallel software.  At             
              present, detailed architectural design as well as a rich variety of            
              simulation studies have already been carried out for the ensemble, a           
              fine grained SIMD processor on a chip.  The entire RRM will be made            
              up of 4096 ensemble chips.  The present project addresses the problem          
              of communication among these ensembles.
