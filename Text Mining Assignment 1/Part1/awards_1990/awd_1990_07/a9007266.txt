Abstract    :
              An Engineering Research Equipment award will allow the purchase of             
              a pulsed holographic Ruby laser for a three-dimensional focused                
              Schlieren systems.  The development of this research equipment will            
              further research in the area of shock-boundary layer and shock-                
              vortex interactions ongoing at the investigator's institution.                 
                                                                                             
              These interactions occur at the high velocities encountered in                 
              rapid flight, and play a role in the design of high-speed aerospace            
              vehicles.
