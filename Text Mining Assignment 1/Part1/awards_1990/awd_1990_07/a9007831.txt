Abstract    :
                   Professor Robinson will conduct research in the area of                   
              multi-dimensional symbolic dynamical systems associated with                   
              tilings of the plane and higher dimensional Euclidean spaces.                  
              These dynamical systems are continuous actions of n-dimensional                
              Euclidean space on compact metric spaces.  They are related to                 
              Ambrose-Kakutani-Rudolph representation theory.  In addition,                  
              Professor Robinson will continue his work on how various ergodic               
              properties lift to extensions.  In particular he will concentrate              
              on how joinings lift to extensions.                                            
                   In the early 1980's experimental physicists were surprised                
              to see five-fold rotational symmetry in what they thought to be                
              a periodic crystal.  This is however a mathematical impossibility              
              and it was later observed that the substance was not periodic but              
              rather "quasiperiodic".  The research of Professor Robinson will               
              attempt to apply techniques from ergodic theory and dynamical                  
              systems to understand this situation.
