Abstract    :
                   Dr. Thomas Givnish and Kenneth Systma at the University of                
              Wisconsin, Madison are researching evolutionary relationships in               
              Brocchinia and other genera of the most primitive subfamily of                 
              the pineapple family (Bromeliaceae). Additional monocot families               
              (lilies, orchids, grasses, etc.) will be surveyed for a unique                 
              genetic marker discovered in bromeliads, in order to determine                 
              levels of phylogenetic relatedness within the monocotyledon                    
              plants. Brocchinia is of interest because it lies close to the                 
              base of the pineapple family, is transitional between the most                 
              primitive and most advanced subfamilies, is native to the most                 
              ancient part of South America, and has evolved a remarkable range              
              of mechanisms for capturing nutrients, including carnivory,                    
              nitrogen fixation, and feeding by ants. Data for the phylogenetic              
              study will be derived by directly sequencing chloroplast genes.                
              Goals of the research are to develop an understanding of how                   
              various groups of bromeliads evolved, how patterns of shared                   
              ancestry relate to their current distribution in specific                      
              regions of North and South America, and how they have adapted to               
              conditions of extreme soil infertility and/or aridity.
