Abstract    :
              Description:  This project supports travel of ten U.S. scientists              
              to participate in the Ninth Symposium on Earthquake Engineering                
              to be held in Roorkee, India, December 14-16, 1990 and organized               
              by the University of Roorkee and the Indian society of Earthquake              
              Technology.  The sessions will include:  engineering seismology                
              and seismotectonics; microzonation; urban design and public                    
              policy; survey and evaluation of damages; gravity structures;                  
              buildings behavior; offshore structures; retrofitting of                       
              structures; soil-structures interaction; and earth and rockfilled              
              dams and embankments.  The meeting is expected to be well                      
              attended from India, the U.S., Europe and Japan.                               
                                                                                             
              Scope:  Earthquake effects are of global interest.  The U.S. and               
              India are among leading countries conducting vigorous research in              
              various earthquake engineering aspects.  The conference provides               
              a good forum for a fruitful exchange of research findings and                  
              ideas.  The University of Roorkee has departments of earthquake                
              engineering, civil engineering, and geology and geophysics where               
              research is being done.  Cooperative research between Roorkee                  
              staff and U.S. scientists has continued for more than a decade.
