Abstract    :
              This research equipment award is made to partially fund the                    
              purchase of computer hardware and peripheral equipment that will               
              improve the operation of an existing system that is used to                    
              simulate occupant dynamics in car crashes.  The simulation model               
              that is used covers both vehicular geometry and restraint systems.
