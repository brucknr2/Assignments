Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to study the effects of              
              dynamic loads and extreme environments on structural glazing                   
              systems.  Specific areas of research include studying the effects              
              of temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation on                    
              structural silicone properties and conducting full-scale failure               
              tests of structural glazing samples under dynamic loads.                       
              Investigators will improve present models which predict properties             
              of a structural silicone and forces in a structurally glazed panel             
              using data from the proposed research work.
