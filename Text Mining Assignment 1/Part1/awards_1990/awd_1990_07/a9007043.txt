Abstract    :
                    Theories of design systems do not currently take into                    
              account the influence of organizational and contextual                         
              influences.  This research team will demonstrate the concept of                
              optimized design through a case study to be developed in                       
              collaboration with a pioneering concurrent engineering effort of               
              an industrial partner.  The demonstration case will then be                    
              compared with national norms for practice and process in design.
