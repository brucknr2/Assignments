Abstract    :
              The Theoretical Biology and Biomathematics Gordon Conference is                
              unique among conferences in theoretical biology in both its                    
              breadth and openness of exchange.  Unlike most meetings in                     
              theoretical biology, it does not concentrate on any one                        
              theoretical technique or biological topic.  The conference brings              
              together experimentals and theoretician from some of the most                  
              active areas of biological research who believe that theory and                
              mathematical modeling can make valuable contributions toward                   
              understanding some of the basic phenomena in their respective                  
              areas.  The biological problems stem from developmental biology,               
              physiology, population biology and neurobiology.  The kinds of                 
              mathematical techniques that are employed include qualitative                  
              analysis and numerical computations on systems of ordinary and                 
              partial differential equations, classical model identification                 
              techniques, and the development of new analytical approaches to                
              experimental data.
