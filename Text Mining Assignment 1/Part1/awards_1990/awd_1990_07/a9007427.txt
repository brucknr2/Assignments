Abstract    :
              This is a SGER project on a controversial                                      
              subject: transient stability methodology for                                   
              electric power systems.  The investigators are                                 
              examining new indices and measures for                                         
              transient stability including measures of                                      
              security margin, critical parameters, critical                                 
              contingencies, vulnerability, and indices of                                   
              stress.  The project includes methodologies                                    
              which are capable of direct calculation of                                     
              these parameters.  Additional project foci                                     
              include expert system sorting of stability                                     
              indices and on-line methodologies.  The                                        
              project is controversial in that it is at odds                                 
              with traditional methods and their use for                                     
              transient stability assessment.
