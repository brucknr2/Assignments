Abstract    :
              A Rheometric Fluid Spectrometer will be acquired to support                    
              basic research in the mechanics of suspensions, viscoelastic                   
              fluids and surfactant solutions.  The equipment will be used                   
              by several faculty members of the Levich Institute for                         
              physico-chemical hydrodynamics and of the CUNY Physics,                        
              Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering Departments.                   
                                                                                             
              This award will support an interdisciplinary research effort                   
              in the areas of rheology of suspension and two-phase flow.
