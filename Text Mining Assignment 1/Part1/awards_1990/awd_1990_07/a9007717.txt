Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research project is to develop a                    
              number of statistical procedures for satellite data analysis.                  
              Such astronomical data have a number of singular aspects that                  
              necessitate the development of new statistical methods. Specific               
              problems that will be addressed involve nonparametric regression               
              when both the independent and dependent variables are subject to               
              left censoring and nonparametric regression between ratios                     
              obtained from left-censored data. Optimal designs for                          
              astronomical surveys with nondetections will be developed.                     
              Bootstrap methods for regression with measurement errors will                  
              also be developed and  regression problems will be analyzed where              
              the variables are subject to measurement error whose variance is               
              known but varies across the observations.
