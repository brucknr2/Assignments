Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation project will support the research of a cultural              
              anthropologist studying the Navajo perceptions and cultural                    
              understandings of autism.  The student, who has extensive                      
              experience studying autism in non-Indian society, will determine               
              whether the Navajo have a concept of an illness syndrome similar               
              to the one we label "autism", and will study how the Navajo                    
              culture conceptualizes and deals with this form of disease.                    
              Methods include participant observation in a home for                          
              "exceptional" (i.e., mentally ill) children on the reservation;                
              formal interviews and informal discussions with the family of                  
              children in the home as well as with other Navajo.                             
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it will add to our basic core               
              of knowledge of the cultural variation in the labelling and                    
              conceptualization of disease.  Such knowledge is essential if we               
              are to improve the delivery of health care in a multi-cultural                 
              society.
