Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              North Carolina State University's Tropical Soils Research Program              
              and Colorado State University's Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory            
              continue to investigate the determinants and consequences of soil              
              organic matter (SOM) in the humid tropics. Main activities consist             
              of 1) determining the relative effects of soil texture and clay                
              mineralogy on total SOM content, 2) estimating the size of                     
              different SOM functional pools, 3) relating their N and P supplying            
              capacity to texture and mineralogy, 4) determining the relative                
              importance of physical protection, chemical recalcitrance and                  
              nutrient availability on the SOM pools, and 5) quantifying the                 
              effects of different land use practices on SOM pools.  The CENTURY             
              model will be modified for use in tropical conditions.  The results            
              will provide a deeper understanding of organic matter dynamics in              
              soils with variable charge which will serve as a base for improved             
              agricultural sustainability in the humic tropics and more realistic            
              estimates of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere upon deforestation.               
                                                                                             
              This is an excellent research team that pioneered the development              
              and calibration of the CENTURY model.  The model has been used                 
              extensively for studying soil development. The facilities available            
              for this research are excellent.
