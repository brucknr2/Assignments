Abstract    :
              Recently, the investigators have                                               
              demonstrated that multiple quantum                                             
              well structures consisting of very                                             
              thin (10A) alternating layers of two                                           
              crystalline organic semiconductors                                             
              can be grown by the new ultrahigh                                              
              vacuum process of organic molecular                                            
              beam epitaxy (OMBE).  X-ray and                                                
              birefringence data indicate that the                                           
              structures are highly ordered both                                             
              in the stacking direction, as well                                             
              as across the water surface.  Thus,                                            
              the growth is considered to be                                                 
              "quasi-epitaxial" in that this                                                 
              ordering occurs even though the                                                
              lattices of the two organic                                                    
              materials are incommensurate.                                                  
              Control of the crystalline texture                                             
              is strongly influenced by the                                                  
              dependence of molecular surface                                                
              mobility on temperature.  For                                                  
              example, the highest degree of                                                 
              crystalline ordering is observed for                                           
              substrates cooled to less than 100

              investigator will use a laser in                                               
              conjunction with their OMBE system                                             
              to locally heat the cooled substrate                                           
              during growth, thus creating highly                                            
              defined regions of both ordered and                                            
              disordered growth.  This fine                                                  
              control of both layer order, as well                                           
              as the already demonstrated ability                                            
              to grow very thin films, should                                                
              allow them to understand, and hence                                            
              control the growth processes to a                                              
              high degree.  This control will be                                             
              utilized to fabricate several                                                  
              optical devices such as gratings and                                           
              waveguides.  Futhermore, by making                                             
              structures consisting of very thin

              may be able to break the                                                       
              centrosymmetry characteristic of

              in turn, should lead to a

              grow such structures and probe their
