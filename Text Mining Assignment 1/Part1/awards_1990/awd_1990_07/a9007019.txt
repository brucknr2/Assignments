Abstract    :
                   The P.I.'s will raise sediment cores from lakes in the                    
              Brazilian Amazon.  All lakes have been chosen by ground                        
              reconnaissance by Brazilian personnel in association with the                  
              project, or from shuttle imagery, the prime requirement being                  
              that the lakes be divorced from the river system, preferably                   
              occupying closed basins.  The target is continuous sedimentary                 
              sequences spanning the time of the last glaciation in the north.               
                                                                                             
              The investigator will reconstruct histories of forest plant                    
              populations by pollen and phyolith analysis.  The results will be              
                                                                                             
              used to test hypotheses relating to: the existence of rain forest              
                                                                                             
              refugia during northern glacial maxima, the permanence of rain                 
              forest communities, glacial temperature depression in the lowland              
                                                                                             
              tropics, rain forest perturbance time-scales and the causes of                 
              diversity, the environmental impact of long term (.>6000 yr)                   
              human disturbance on the rain forests, and to suggest strategies               
                                                                                             
              of wise use or conservation for Amazonia.
