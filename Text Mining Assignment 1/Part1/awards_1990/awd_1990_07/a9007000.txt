Abstract    :
                   The investigators will test the hypothesis that postnatal                 
              growth rate is inversely related to the functional capacity of                 
              skeletal muscle.  If birds are constrained by such a relationship              
              during the course of development, they shall be able to interpret              
              variation in growth rate in terms of the precocity of the newly                
              hatched chick and the quality and extent of care provided by the               
              parents.                                                                       
                   They will measure functional capacity directly by the                     
              ability of chicks to generate heat in response to cold stress,                 
              and  indirectly by the biochemical attributes of muscle,                       
              particularly enzyme activities.  The project compares altricial                
              species, which require intense parental care, to precocial                     
              species, which can maintain body temperature and feed themselves               
              soon after hatching.                                                           
                   The project will be among the few studies to date to                      
              consider organism-level constraints on the optimization of life-               
              history adaptations and should help in understanding the design                
              of organisms more generally.
