Abstract    :
              Professor Robert B. Weisman is supported by a grant from the                   
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the                           
              spectroscopy and dynamics of excited gas phase organic                         
              molecules.  This research will help to further our                             
              understanding of laser induced photochemical reactions.                        
                                                                                             
              Weisman will employ nanosecond pulsed lasers to perform                        
              electronic and vibrational spectroscopy on excited states and                  
              photochemical products of organic compunds.  In one project,                   
              Weissman will continue his study of the light-induced                          
              dissociation and isomerization of azoalkanes. This work is to                  
              be complemented by quantum chemical calculations in support of                 
              the detailed mechanism which Weisman has proposed based on his                 
              experimental findings.  In another study Weisman will use                      
              transient CARS to explore the gas phase photodissociation of                   
              1,3-cyclohexadiene.  Additional experiments based on a recently                
              developed method to measure the collisional loss of vibrational                
              energy from organic molecules will be used to identify the                     
              factors that cause unexpected variations in vibrational energy                 
              transfer as a function of energy in the colliders.  Finally,                   
              transient infrared absorption will be developed as a tool to                   
              probe short-lived excited states of gas phase polyatomics.
