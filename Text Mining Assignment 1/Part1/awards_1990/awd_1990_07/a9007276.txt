Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the procurement of equipment needed                      
              to enhance research on the active control of structural                        
              vibrations.  The equipment comprises a real time feedback                      
              control system and a vibration test data acquisition                           
              system.  It supports two research projects.  The first is                      
              an experimental investigation of controller design for                         
              regulating space structure vibration with specific focus on                    
              the precision pointing of spacecraft in which structural                       
              vibrations dominate the attitude dynamics.  The research                       
              tests the hypothesis that high performance structural                          
              controllers must come from iteratively linking modeling and                    
              control design.  The second project experimentally tests a                     
              new optimization theory of actively controlled aircraft                        
              wing design associated with lightweight highly maneuverable                    
              aircraft.  Scale model wings designed with embedded                            
              actuators and sensors will be controlled to deform to                          
              produce lift in novel way which does not depend on                             
              conventional aileron actuators.
