Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the genetic architecture of               
              the MSP (major sperm protein) gene family in Caenorhabditis                    
              elegans and related nematodes.  Gene families appear to be                     
              adaptive solutions to the demand that cells produce certain kinds              
              of proteins in great abundance, and the MSP gene complex is a                  
              paradigm for this evolutionary mode.  MSP in C. elegans is coded               
              by 40-50 genes that occur in four clusters on two chromosomes.                 
              Genes within clusters are more similar in sequence than are genes              
              residing in different clusters.  Hypothetical mechanisms for the               
              evolution of gene families include the "radiation" of duplicate                
              genes within a cluster from an ancestral gene (in which case                   
              similarity is by descent) and gene conversion in which sequence                
              information is homogenized within a cluster by unequal crossing                
              over or some comparable mechanism.                                             
                    The investigator will test these and other hypotheses by                 
              comparing the architecture of the MSP complex between various                  
              strains of C. elegans and other species in the same genus.  The                
              mechanisms of gene family evolution are formulated in terms of                 
              population genetics but the comparative methodology, to include                
              stimating phylogenies for gene families, draws heavily on the                  
              principles of systematic biology, whereas a major goal is to                   
              understand the structure of this important class of eukaryotic                 
              genes; thus, this research is truly interdisciplinary.
