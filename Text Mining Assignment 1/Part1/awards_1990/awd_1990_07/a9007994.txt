Abstract    :
                   Evolutionary studies often conclude that lineages of                      
              organisms have acquired "adaptations" -- novel morphological,                  
              behavioral, ecological, or reproductive features that confer some              
              advantage to individual organisms.  Very rarely do these studies               
              confirm the actual advantage by direct measurement.  One example               
              is the evolution of the symmetrical ("homocercal") fish tail from              
              asymmetric ("heterocercal") precursors.  The conclusion has been               
              that the homocercal tail conferred higher speed, greater                       
              maneuverability, and faster acceleration.  Dr. George Lauder                   
              proposes to use newly developed micro-accelerometers, mounted on               
              the tails of fish swimming in flow tanks, to gather performance                
              data to test this conclusion.  The accelerometer data gathering                
              will be coordinated with Dr. Lauder's high-speed video imaging                 
              and electromyography (muscle activity) monitoring systems.  The                
              first performance data will emerge for homocercal and                          
              heterocercal fishes.                                                           
                   The proposed research is inherently risky, being the first                
              application of new sensors to a biological problem.  Extensive                 
              software development will be necessary to couple the three data                
              streams.  If this Small Grant for Exploratory Research Project is              
              successful, biologists will have acquired a powerful new                       
              technique for assessing functional capabilities, and a                         
              significant question in fish evolution will have been addressed.
