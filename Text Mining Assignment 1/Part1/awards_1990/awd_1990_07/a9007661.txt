Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The award is for support of the 56th annual meeting of the                
              American Malacological Union to be held from 3 - 7 June 1990                   
              at the Marine Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.                   
              A special symposium on neuroscience and behavior is planned for                
              which support is awarded.  This symposium will be well attended                
              and several out standing scientist in the field of evolutionary                
              aspects of integrative neuroscience have been invited.  The                    
              symposium should be important in synthesising much of the current              
              knowledge in this area as it relates to primitive neuronal                     
              networks involved in behavior.
