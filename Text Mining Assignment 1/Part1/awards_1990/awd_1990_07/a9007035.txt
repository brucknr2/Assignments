Abstract    :
                   Professor Mauldin will conduct research in various aspects                
              of the measure theory of fractal objects.  One major theme                     
              centers on Hausdorff measure and its variants.  Topics include                 
              (i) further development of deterministic and random recursions                 
              yielding objects in n-space and determining their Hausdorff and                
              packing dimension functions, (ii) finding the exact Hausdorff                  
              dimension of the graphs of general Hardy-Weierstrass functions,                
              and (iii) characterizing Hausdorff measures which scale.  A                    
              second theme centers on the production of random maps and finding              
              their properties.                                                              
                   Most smooth objects in space have an integer dimension.                   
              For example a solid object has dimension three and a surface                   
              dimension two.  Hausdorff dimension and measure are capable of                 
              describing fractal objects which have non-integer dimension.
