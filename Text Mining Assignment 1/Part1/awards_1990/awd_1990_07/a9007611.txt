Abstract    :
              A high-resolution ac calorimeter will be used to study phase                   
              transitions occurring in frustrated smectic liquid crystals and                
              in binary mixtures of such molecules.  The analysis of high-                   
              resolution heat capacity data will give information on critical                
              energy fluctuations associated with smectic ordering.
