Abstract    :
              The hypothesis that proteins in aqueous solution interact                      
              with adsorbent surfaces primarily via hydrophobic                              
              interactions will be tested by manipulation of the                             
              hydrophobic effect at its origin: the ability of the                           
              solvent to assume ordered structures in the vicinity of                        
              nonpolar species.  This method is a desirable alternative                      
              to studies of protein adsorption to a wide variety of                          
              materials, where aspects of the surface chemistry other                        
              than hydrophobicity are varied in an uncontrolled manner.                      
              As cosolvents with water, methanol impairs the                                 
              hydrophobic effect, glycerol enhances it, and ethylene                         
              glycol does not significantly alter the effect.  By                            
              careful selection of the experimental system, constant                         
              protein conformation and adsorbent surface chemistry will                      
              be maintained in the presence of the different structure-                      
              altering cosolvents in order to assess the role of the                         
              hydrophobic effect in controlling adsorption isotherms and                     
              rates, adsorption reversibility, and surface diffusion.                        
              While adsorption isotherms and rates of adsorption and                         
              desorption reflect long time processes, measurements of                        
              surface diffusion coefficients provide information about                       
              processes occurring in the protein-surface binding region                      
              on rapid time scales.
