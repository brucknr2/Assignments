Abstract    :
              This grant funds the development, testing, and distribution of                 
              innovative microelectronics educational materials and the execution            
              of a pilot project on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).                  
              These materials are for both lecture and lab use in a variety of               
              courses and employ multiple media in creative and dynamic ways.                
              The first materials have already been developed and tested at the              
              University of Hawaii, Stanford University and at the University of             
              California Berkeley.  The FPGA pilot project manages the evaluation            
              of FPGA kits at 15 universities and provides FPGA bulletin-board               
              support as a pilot study of the feasibility of a national FPGA                 
              support center.  Testing at several sites began in the fall of                 
              1990, with materials being widely distributed in the summer of                 
              1991.
