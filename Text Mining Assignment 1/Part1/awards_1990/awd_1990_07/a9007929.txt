Abstract    :
              The objective of this study is to examine the mechanics and physics            
              of cracking in single crystal and polycrystalline freshwater/saline            
              ice, and develop the mechanics of fracture appropriate to                      
              interpreting these events in ice.  The influence of loading rate,              
              temperature, loading configuration, and microstructure are to be               
              determined.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The primary focus will be whether creep or plastic deformation                 
              leads to crack tip blunting in ice.  To provide information on the             
              role of the microstructure and the physics and mechanisms of                   
              fracture, an etch pits technique will be used as well as optical               
              microcopy and the scanning electron microscope.  The                           
              micromechanical and physical information, as well as petrographic              
              tensile strength, flexural strength, fracture energy, fracture                 
              toughness, and compressive strength.//
