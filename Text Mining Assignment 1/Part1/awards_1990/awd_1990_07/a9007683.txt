Abstract    :
              Studies of the collective-mode spectrum of normal and superfluid               
              3He will be continued.  Extension will be made to the non-linear               
              region, first searching for the analog of stimulated Raman                     
              scattering.  In addition, collective modes will be examined in                 
              polarized and solid 3He.
