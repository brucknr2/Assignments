Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will be seeking to obtain a new                
              central limit theorem for sequences of weak dependent random                   
              variables.  Some of the results will have a theoretical                        
              character and will be a contribution to the clarification of                   
              some old problems.  Other results will have rather a practical                 
              meaning.  The focus of the study is  the asymptotic distribution               
              of partial sums of weakly dependent random variables normalized                
              by estimators of the standard deviation of partial sums.  These                
              estimators will be easily computable from data.
