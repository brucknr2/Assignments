Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests funding for a liquid scintillation (LS)                 
              system to provide new and important technical capabilities in                  
              the principal investigator's (PI's) research programs.                         
              Specializing in mass transfer through membranes and porous                     
              media, the principal investigator is currently focusing her                    
              research efforts in two areas:  (1) percutaneous absorption of                 
              solutes, and (2) in-place remediation technologies for vadose                  
              zone soils.  The ability to measure concentrations of                          
              radiolabelled compounds will greatly expand the scientific                     
              issues which can be studied in these two programs.  Although                   
              LS counting is essential to the research endeavors described                   
              here, the extent of use on a given research project makes                      
              justification of its purchase as dedicated instrument on                       
              single research proposal difficult.  Consequently, the                         
              proposed instrument will be made available for campus wide                     
              use.  Presently LS counting is not available at the Colorado                   
              School of Mines (CSM).  The proposed LS system will provide                    
              many important new research opportunities for other                            
              researchers at CSM.  As with many other analytical                             
              instruments, the demands LS capabilities certainly will grow                   
              once an instrument is available on the CSM campus.
