Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with two projects in matrix                    
              theory. For the first project, G is an undirected graph on n                   
              vertices and M(G) is an associated convex cone. The principal                  
              investigators will examine the structure of the extreme                        
              matrices, particularly when M(G) has extreme points of large                   
              rank. The second project is concerned with determining the                     
              extreme points of a collection of certain semidefinite                         
              matrices. They will investigate whether the rank and sparsity                  
              pattern alone determine if a matrix is an extreme point.                       
                   A matrix is a rectangular array with possible entries from                
              a wide variety of rings. This is a field which originated in                   
              the nineteenth century as part of algebra. It is currently very                
              active in view of its many applications and connections with                   
              other parts of mathematics and other scientific and technical                  
              disciplines.
