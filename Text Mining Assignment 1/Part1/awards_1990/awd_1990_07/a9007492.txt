Abstract    :
                   Studies of conflicts between mutualists and their                         
              evolutionary consequences are critical for understanding how                   
              both mutualisms and antagonisms arise and persist.  However,                   
              nearly all studies of mutualisms focus on the interests of one of              
              the partners only.  The proposed study of two sympatric                        
              fig/pollinator mutualisms will investigate the nature and                      
              consequences of one pivotal mutualistic trait within-tree                      
              reproductive phenology, from the perspective of both partners.                 
              Using detailed observations and a set of manipulative                          
              experiments.  The P.I. will (1) provide the first quantitative                 
              description of the relevant phenological traits for any fig                    
              species; (2) define patterns of phenological variation at the                  
              scales of branch, tree, local site, region, species, and season;               
              (3) measure reproductive consequences of within-tree phenology                 
              for each mutualist partner; and (4) use this information to test               
              a set of hypotheses for the cause of phenological differences                  
              among and within fig species.  The costs and benefits of                       
              phenological traits critical for the maintenance of these                      
              interactions as mutualisms will be established for the first time              
              by this study.  More broadly, it will demonstrate the value of a               
              reciprocal rather than unilateral approach to understanding                    
              ecological and evolutionary dynamics of a mutualism.                           
              These results from this study will have important implications in              
              many natural communities.
