Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The computational demands of modern chemical research require the              
              proper computing system that would avoid wasteful bottlenecks by               
              balancing a variety of computational capabilities with individual              
              workstations, networks, hardware and software maintenance, support             
              personnel and training in all areas of computational chemistry.                
              Many new insights into kinetics of chemical reactions can be                   
              developed through theoretical studies with use of mini-                        
              supercomputers when the experimental data are inaccessible.  In                
              addition, the most cost-effective computers are the mini-                      
              supercomputers.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This award will allow the Department of Chemistry at the                       
              University of Wisconsin to acquire a mini-supercomputer system.
