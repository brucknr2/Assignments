Abstract    :
              The principal investigator,  in collaboration with Leroy Odom and              
              Edwin Hilinski at Florida State University, will attempt to                    
              develop a quartz geochronometer and geothermometer.  He will do                
              so by examining the number of Schottky-Frenkel defects in natural              
              quartz using electron spin resonance spectroscopy, then                        
              determining the age of the quartz via improved uranium-thorium                 
              dating techniques, thereby establishing the rate of accumulation               
              of the defects.  Through annealing experiments a study also will               
              be made of the thermal stabilities and mean lives of the defects;              
              this in turn could provide a basis for a geologically useful                   
              geochronometer.  Since quartz is a common minerals, development                
              of this tool could have wide application, and would be                         
              particularly useful for rocks in which other methods cannot be                 
              applied.  The understanding of defects in quartz also will                     
              benefit the semiconductor industry.
