Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks to investigate an interesting and robust                   
              phenomenon of group interaction, the "discontinuity effect."                   
              This effect refers to the fact that people interacting as group                
              members are consistently more competitive than when acting alone.              
              A number of interesting possibilities will be tested in this                   
              series of laboratory investigations, most of which make use of                 
              variables with considerable real-world impact.  In one of the                  
              studies, for example, the racial composition of the group members              
              will be studied.  In another study, the effects of greed and fear              
              are studied in the group or individual allocation of resources.                
              The theoretical and practical implications of the work are                     
              interesting and valuable.  The investigators are first rate, and               
              well known for their important contributions to this area.  As                 
              such, the project shows every sign of providing an important                   
              contribution to knowledge of the actions of individuals in                     
              groups.
