Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Several species of the nematode, an invertebrate widely used in                
              genetics research, are very sensitive to volatile anesthetics                  
              while some species have a low sensitivity.  The differential                   
              sensitivity in this animal is caused by recessive mutations in                 
              the gene unc-1.  This project entails studying the mechanism of                
              volatile anesthetics action in the nervous system of the nematode              
              by identifying the components of the site of action.  Additional               
              spontaneous mutations in the unc-1 gene and fragments of the                   
              chromosomes which contain the gene will be identified, leading to              
              the cloning of the gene.  The research will make it possible to                
              identify the proteins coded by the unc-1 gene and provide                      
              necessary information about the molecular biology of animal                    
              responses to anesthetics.
