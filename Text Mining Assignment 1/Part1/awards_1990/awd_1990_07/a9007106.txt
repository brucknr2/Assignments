Abstract    :
              With a few exceptions, the current role of database knowledge is               
              to assist in the evaluation of data queries.  This project                     
              applies database knowledge in two new tasks: knowledge queries                 
              and intensional answers.  When database knowledge is of                        
              substantial volume and complexity, there is genuine need to                    
              interrogate it directly.  Moreover, since users of the database                
              may not be able to distinguish between information that is data                
              and information that is knowledge, both should be available for                
              querying, preferably by means of a single instrument that would                
              blur the distinction.  Database knowledge can also be used to                  
              characterize the extensional answers issued by the database.                   
              Knowledge statements that apply to an extensional answer are                   
              inferred from the global knowledge and presented as an                         
              intensional answer, thus providing extensional answers with                    
              additional meaning and insight.  This project extends the role of              
              knowledge, to provide answers that contain knowledge, either in                
              response to knowledge queries, or in response to data queries.                 
              As these two topics have much in common, they are investigated                 
              within a common framework, logic databases, to provide a unified               
              solution: a query language for both data and knowledge, and an                 
              answering mechanism that responds with both data and knowledge.                
              The results of this research are expected to improve the                       
              expressivity of query languages and the meaningfulness of                      
              database responses.
