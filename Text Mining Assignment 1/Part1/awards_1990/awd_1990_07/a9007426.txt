Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research equipment award will be used to purchase a Resonant              
              Column Device, a soil testing device.  The dynamic response of                 
              soils will be studied.  Application include earthquakes, vibrating             
              machinery foundations, blast effects on foundations, grout                     
              distribution, and in general soils and foundations subjected to                
              dynamic loads.
