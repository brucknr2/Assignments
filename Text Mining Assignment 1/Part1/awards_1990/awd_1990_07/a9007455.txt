Abstract    :
                   The Mammal Collection in the Louisiana State University                   
              Museum of Natural Science comprises 30,000 specimens, placing it               
              among the largest such university collections in the U.S.  The                 
              collection has grown remarkably during the past decade, and more               
              than half of its current holdings are from the New World                       
              Tropics.  Dr. Mark Hafner, Curator of Mammals and Director of the              
              Museum, proposes a renovation of the Museum's collections,                     
              leading to expanded storage space and incorporation of a large                 
              collection donated by the University of Southwestern Louisiana.                
              New storage cabinets will be installed on a mezzanine to be built              
              above the present collections area. In consolidating these                     
              collections, researchers will be given greater access to                       
              important reference specimens.                                                 
                   Systematic collections in natural history museums are an                  
              incomparable record of the evolution of life on earth.                         
              Systematists, ecologists, biogeographers, functional                           
              morphologists, and researchers from a variety of other                         
              disciplines are increasingly dependent on these research                       
              resources.  The continued growth and improvement of these                      
              collections will have wide impact on research into biological                  
              diversity.
