Abstract    :
              Zwitterionic surfactant solutions consisting of dimethyl betaines              
              in water and salt-water will be studied using light scattering                 
              techniques.  Micellar solutions will be investigated over a broad              
              range of conditions to include varying amphiphile concentrations,              
              temperature and pressure.  The shape, size and flexibility of                  
              grown micelles will be examined together with a search for                     
              micellar liquid crystalline phases formed from worm-like                       
              micelles.
