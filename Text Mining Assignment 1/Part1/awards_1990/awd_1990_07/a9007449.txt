Abstract    :
              This project is directed at developing a better understanding of               
              the nature of some of the basic econonic issues facing centrally               
              planned economies, especially as these issues relate to the                    
              transition of these economies to more market.oriented systems.                 
              The importance of this research stems from the historical                      
              significance of the economic transformation now under way in the               
              communist countries of Eastern Europe, and the need to better                  
              understand the salient economic issues involved.                               
                                                                                             
              This research is primarily an application of economic theory to                
              the area of comparative economic systems, and it will improve our              
              understanding of the economic reform process in three areas.  The              
              first application will extend classical consumer theory from the               
              special case of market clearing prices to the more general case                
              of arbitrary prices with search, waiting, and inventory behavior,              
              which are absent in the special case of market clearing.  The                  
              second study will show why planned economies are usually plagued               
              by shortages of consumer goods.  The third application will                    
              analyze the conditions under which a mixture of planned and                    
              market systems may be much worse than either system alone.  This               
              could have important implications for how one gets to a market                 
              system without making things much worse during the transition.
