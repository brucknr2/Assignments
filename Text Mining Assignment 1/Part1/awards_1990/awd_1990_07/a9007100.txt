Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant is to purchase the equipment necessary to apply                     
              reflection high energy electron diffraction to the study of                    
              epitaxial growth of phosphide-based compound semiconductors.  The              
              instrument is a charge coupled detector-based camera system                    
              which has the capability of high sensitivity and dynamic range,                
              high speed data transfer for real time measurements, multiple                  
              beam measurement capacity, high angular resolution.  The                       
              instrument is being used to study dynamics of dislocations during              
              epitaxial growth of compound semiconductors, the growth of tilted              
              superlattices, surface atomic structure, precision control of                  
              stoichiometry, quantum wire devices, and quantum-effect                        
              transistors.
