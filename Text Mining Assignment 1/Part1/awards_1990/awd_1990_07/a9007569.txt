Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Harry A. Morrison at Purdue                       
              University.  This research will yield results of fundamental                   
              significance about chemical processes that result from the                     
              interaction of organic molecules with light.                                   
                                                                                             
              Dr. Morrison's research is designed to provide important                       
              information about the reactivity of photochemical                              
              intermediates, particularly those generated from difunctional                  
              molecules.  The investigation will focus on understanding three                
              related phenomena:  (1) the photochemical consequences of                      
              orbital mixing for molecules having two non-conjugated                         
              functional groups, (2) intramolecular photosensitization in                    
              multifunctional molecules, and (3) photochemical processes                     
              involving molecules in upper electronic and vibrational excited                
              states.  Molecular orbital calculations will be employed to                    
              interpret and correlate the experimental results.
