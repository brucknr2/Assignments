Abstract    :
                   This research program is aimed at developing a                            
              comprehensive theory of the geometrical foundations that underlie              
              the dynamics of highly nonlinear control system, that can only                 
              very poorly be described by linear approximations.  It is                      
              intended to focus first on the practical purposes of feedback                  
              stabilization of highly-nonlinear systems.  Of particular                      
              immediate interest is a generalization of the classical zero-                  
              dynamics manifold only by some high-order condition (immediately               
              related to tracking through singularities).  This is envisioned                
              to parallel the development of condition for controllability,                  
              from linear, over first order nonlinear to eventually high-order               
              nonlinear conditions.  A second main direction involves the                    
              development of tools in terms of elements of a free Lie algebra                
              (and the relations they satisfy) that allow one to concisely                   
              describe conditions for stabilizability, and also characterize                 
              controllability and optimality.  Most important are the                        
              characterization of filtrations and of bases of a free nilpotent               
              Lie algebra (on a finite number of generators) that are suitable               
              for the problems considered.  This work is a continuation of a                 
              research program that has expanded from controllability, to the                
              visualization of geometrical and topological properties of the                 
              control system.
