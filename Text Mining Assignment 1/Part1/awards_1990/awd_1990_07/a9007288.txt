Abstract    :
                   The survival and growth of woody plants in dryland regions                
              of the United States depends on their ability to withstand tissue              
              dehydration during drought.  It is particularly important that                 
              the cells specialized in transporting water (xylem vessels) from               
              the soil to leaves remain functional and that the water column                 
              not be disrupted by air bubbles (embolism).  In higher plants the              
              introduction of air bubbles into xylem vessels results in a                    
              blockage of water transport and, if extensive enough, kills the                
              plant.  Laboratory experiments indicate that one of the major                  
              cases of xylem embolism is severe water stress during extended                 
              periods of drought.  However, very little is known about the                   
              occurrence and significance of embolism in nature.  No data are                
              available for dryland plants where tissue water stress is great                
              and thus where embolism may be the most significant.  The                      
              objective of this proposed study is to provide the first                       
              information on the role of xylem embolism in plant growth,                     
              productivity, and survival of dryland plants, specifically                     
              chaparral shrubs indigenous to California.  This project will                  
              shed light on the dynamics of water relations in chaparral                     
              vegetation, especially during the early phases of recovery after               
              wildfire.  This knowledge could potentially lead to an improved                
              management of chaparral as a water shed, as a deterrent of soil                
              erosion/landslides as a cove for wild animals and as a browse for              
              livestock.
