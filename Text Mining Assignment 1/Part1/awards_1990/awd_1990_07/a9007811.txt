Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project represents the extension and development of a program              
              of basic research in statistical mechanics and the study of                    
              ordered states of matter, phase transitions between these states,              
              and related critical phenomena.  A variety of theoretical                      
              techniques will brought to bear including phenomenological and                 
              scaling analyses, renormalization group calculations, Monte Carlo              
              simulations with the aid of a supercomputer facility, exact                    
              mathematical solutions of model statistical mechanical systems,                
              series expansions for singular thermodynamic properties and their              
              extrapolation.
