Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This equipment grant is to improve the                                         
              capability for automatic image processing as                                   
              applied to research in watershed hydrology to                                  
              determine water retention characteristics of                                   
              basins, and to estimate runoff production.                                     
              Data extracted from maps of soil-type                                          
              distribution, topography, rainfall                                             
              distribution and land use, among other                                         
              information, will be used also to estimate the                                 
              potential of floods.  The image processing                                     
              equipment will be used in teaching students                                    
              and training researchers, and in implementing                                  
              algorithmic innovations, software development                                  
              and research progress.
