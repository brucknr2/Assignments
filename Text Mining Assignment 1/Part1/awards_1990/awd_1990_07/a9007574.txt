Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The award provides funds for a workstation to be used for data                 
              reduction for relatively deep images of selected 6 x 6 arcminute               
              fields around cepheids in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds                
              (SMC and LMC).  Images to be analyzed have been obtained with the              
              Las Campana 1.0-meter telescope, and reach magnitudes well below               
              the SMC horizontal branch level.  The goalds of this project are               
              a general study of the underlying setllar populations and, in                  
              particular, to seek faint RR Lyraes.  RR Lyraes are key to globular            
              cluster ages and cepheids are key to the determination of the                  
              Hubble constant.  It is crucial to tie the two scales together in              
              order to resolbe the paradox that the expansion age based on the               
              current value of Hubble's constant is less thant the ages of the               
              oldest globular clusters.
