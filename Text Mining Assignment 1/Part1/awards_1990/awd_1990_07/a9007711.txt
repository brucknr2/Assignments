Abstract    :
              Voelcker         This is a joint project with Herbert B. Voelcker (Cornell 
              University) to continue the successful research on custom  hardware for solid
              modelling.  Duke is extending and improving  the hardware itself, while Cornell
              is building software for  constructive solid geometry (CSG), integrating the
              resulting  system with applications, and conducting field tests.  The  initial
              8-processor system is being upgraded to 256 processors,  to allow parallel
              processing of more complex objects.  At the  same time, the numerical precision
              of the hardware is being  increased, and a tag system is included to allow the
              processors  to keep track of software-specified properties of parts of 
              objects.
