Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on the theory of homeomorphisms on               
              surfaces, specifically rotation and topological entropy.  The                  
              core of the project deals with the problem of verifying the                    
              existence of essential homoclinic orbits in annulus or toral                   
              homeomorphisms by specifying that the rotational behavior be                   
              sufficiently complex, in a precise sense, as measured by the                   
              rotational entropy of the mapping.  The research will also                     
              attempt to formulate a correct notion of a rotational vector on a              
              surface of higher genus, as a means of establishing new criteria               
              for the existence of periodic orbits of a specified rotational                 
              complexity.                                                                    
                   This research is at the interface of surface topology and                 
              dynamical systems.  It makes use of interesting connections                    
              between various topological and dynamical notions in low                       
              dimensional systems.
