Abstract    :
                   The method of resampling for statistical inference known as               
              the "bootstrap" has proved useful in situations where the data                 
              are observations from independent identically distributed random               
              variables and this research will extend the method to a simple                 
              kind of dependence encountered in the Markov chain. One case that              
              will be considered is that of a Markov chain with a countable                  
              state space and homogeneous transition probabilities. The                      
              question of whether or not it is possible to provide bootstrap                 
              descriptions of the distribution of the difference of the                      
              empirical and true transition probabilities will be examined.                  
              Related questions for the estimation of the distribution of                    
              hitting times, stationary distributions, etc., for recurrent                   
              Markov chains with finite, countable and uncountable state spaces              
              will be studied.
