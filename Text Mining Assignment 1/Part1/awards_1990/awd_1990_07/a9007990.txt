Abstract    :
                   Scowcroft's work, in mathematical logic, will center on                   
              constructive mathematics and the model-theory of p-adic fields.                
                   Having found an effective test for the constructive truth of              
              propositions, in real algebra, of a bounded logical complexity,                
              Scowcroft hopes to isolate a convenient set of axioms for these                
              constructively true propositions.  He also wants to learn whether              
              first-order real algebra in Dana Scott's model for intuitionistic              
              analysis is recursively undecidable.  Scowcroft's new model for                
              intuitionistic analysis may permit him to develop a new model for              
              first-order real algebra, and recent work on subanalytic sets may              
              allow him to extend his effective test for constructive truth to               
              propositions involving certain transcendental functions.                       
                   In the model-theory of p-adic fields, Scowcroft plans to                  
              study the properties of definable equivalence relations, the                   
              differences in expressive power between the first-order languages              
              commonly used to describe a p-adic field, and the efficiency of                
              quantifier-elimination procedures for Macintyre's first-order                  
              theory of the p-adics.                                                         
                   These issues in the foundations of algebra bring modern                   
              mathematical logic to bear upon another related area.  Syntheses               
              of this sort have been the source of some of the most significant              
              mathematics of our time.
