Abstract    :
                   A program of research will be initiated to study plasmas                  
              in the early Universe, when general-relativistic effects due to                
              the expansion of the background are significant.  Plasma                       
              dynamics during this epoch could have important ramifications                  
              for the theory of galaxy formation and of the origin of                        
              intergalactic, and possibly also galactic, magnetic fields.                    
              The synthesis of general relativity and plasma physics is a                    
              field that is largely untouched, and the cosmological                          
              implications in particular are mostly unexplored.                              
                   The simple linear theory of cosmological plasmas has been                 
              studied in the single-particle approximation and in the                        
              magnetohydrodynamic limit.  A kinetic approach, based on the                   
              general-relativistic Boltzmann equation, will be carried out.                  
              In addition, some nonlinear analysis will be performed.                        
              However, for most nonlinear phenomena to be studied adequately,                
              numerical simulation is necessary.  Because the nonlinear,                     
              collective effects are among the most interesting, computer                    
              codes are being developed to investigate such effects.  Many                   
              applications of these codes are underway or planned, including,                
              but not limited to, the study of fluctuations in plasmas in the                
              early Universe, the modeling of shock formation and heating due                
              to mode interactions or to Alfven waves, and the investigation                 
              of the effect of dynamo and reconnection mechanisms on the                     
              origin of galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields.
