Abstract    :
              Simultaneous, instantaneous images of the fuel, air, and                       
              reaction intermediates will be made with an intensified                        
              charge-coupled digital camera in a turbulent diffusion flame                   
              by Raman scattering and fluorescence induced with an                           
              ultraviolet(UV) excimer laser.  The imaging technique is based                 
              on recent advances in Raman scattering and laser-induced                       
              predissociative fluorescence (LIPF) using UV excimer lasers.                   
              The images can assess finite rate chemistry effects - the                      
              effect of gradients of fuel and air on the chemistry of the                    
              turbulent flame.  These finite-rate chemistry effects                          
              determine combustion efficiency and pollution formation in                     
              flames.  From the images, the finite-rate chemistry in                         
              turbulent diffusion flames can be quantified so that computer                  
              models of turbulence-chemistry interactions can be improved.                   
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to acquire the imaging equipment necessary to                 
              measure the gradients of temperature, mixture fraction, and                    
              minor species (OH) in a turbulent diffusion flame by imaging                   
              Raman and fluorescence signals from a narrowband excimer                       
              laser.  The photomultiplier tubes used in the point                            
              measurements would be replaced by a gated intensified (ICCD)                   
              camera.
