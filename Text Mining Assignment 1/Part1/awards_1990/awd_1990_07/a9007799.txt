Abstract    :
              This work is aimed at investigating the dynamics of interactions               
              of 10 to 100 electron volt hyperthermal ions with surfaces.                    
              Topics to be addressed include projectile energy loss as a                     
              function of incident mass and scattering geometry; rainbow angle               
              positions as a function of potential and projectile energy; peak               
              broadening caused by vibrational motion in the target; sticking                
              and embedding; and energy transfer and damage thresholds.
