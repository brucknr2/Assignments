Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is for the support of a workshop                                   
              to discuss the simulation of earthquake                                        
              strong ground motions using geotechnical                                       
              centrifuges.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Geotechnical centrifuge modeling is a means                                    
              of testing physical models of earth                                            
              structures - such as embankments and dams -                                    
              in the laboratory: it does this by correctly                                   
              simulating the effect of gravity-induced                                       
              stresses on the strength and stiffness                                         
              properties of soil.  These stresses increase                                   
              with depth, just as water pressure increases                                   
              with depth below the surface.  Subjecting an                                   
              N-th scale earth model to N times the                                          
              acceleration due to gravity yields the                                         
              correct gravity-induced stresses.                                              
                                                                                             
              The state-of-the-art in geotechnical                                           
              centrifuge modeling has progressed rapidly                                     
              during the last decade.  Especially important                                  
              is the fact that during this decade, a new                                     
              generation of geotechnical engineers has been                                  
              trained with an appreciation of, and                                           
              experience in using, this method.  An                                          
              exciting development has been the recent use                                   
              of geotechnical centrifuges to simulate                                        
              earthquake-induced strong ground motions.                                      
              This development has the potential to make a                                   
              dramatic contribution to earthquake hazard                                     
              mitigation.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The objective of this workshop is to explore                                   
              the issues involved in adding an earthquake                                    
              simulation capability to the three large                                       
              national geotechnical centrifuges at the                                       
              University of California at Davis, the

              York.  Participants include representatives                                    
              from academe, federal and state agencies,

              countries.  The workshop is to be held at the
