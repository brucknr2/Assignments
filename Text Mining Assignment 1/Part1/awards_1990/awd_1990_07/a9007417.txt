Abstract    :
                   The P.I. will test and evaluate a numerical scheme designed               
              to cut computational time, with the end product potentially being              
              applicable to large scale global models that include                           
              photochemistry as well as other 3-D models.  The PI plans to                   
              develop a numerical method for solving the equations of                        
              photochemical production and loss.  The distinctive feature of                 
              the proposed procedure is the derivation of an iterative solution              
              for OH based on production and loss terms for odd hydrogen.                    
              Initial results suggest that the new procedure requires five                   
              times less computation time compared to implicit solution                      
              procedures.
