Abstract    :
              This research equipment award is made to partially fund the                    
              purchase of special apparatus that will be used to make fatigue                
              crack growth measurements at elevated temperatures and under                   
              hygrothermal conditions.  It is planned to combine the moire                   
              interferometry and acoustic emissions techniques to locate cracks              
              in a tree dimensional body.
