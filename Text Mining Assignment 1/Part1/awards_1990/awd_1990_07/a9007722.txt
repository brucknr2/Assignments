Abstract    :
                   Dr. Morse will continue studies on the consequences of                    
              differential foraging success within a population, using the crab              
              spider Misumena vatia, a common predator on common milkweed                    
              Asclepias syriaca.  The tendencies of offspring from                           
              differentially successful foraging mothers to disperse from their              
              natal site will be measured.  Misumena is ideal for this purpose               
              because it lays only one clutch of eggs, and foraging success can              
              be readily quantified in terms of clutch size.                                 
                   This research will a) evaluate the roles of natal clutch                  
              size and microhabitat on the offsprings' dispersal away from the               
              nest, and b) the importance of parents' choice of nesting                      
              substrates on juvenile dispersal.                                              
                   This work is of fundamental importance because it will help               
              to determine the relationship between foraging patterns and                    
              fitness and facilitate integration of foraging and life-history                
              theory.  These are two of the major research areas in ecology and              
              population biology today.  In practical terms it will identify                 
              critical and non-critical periods in life cycles and provide                   
              insight into where windows of vulnerability exist.  This                       
              knowledge will have general applicability to other systems, such               
              as those involving agricultural pests.
