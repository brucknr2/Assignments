Abstract    :
                   The Oncobothriidae comprises a family of parasitic cestode                
              tapeworms.  Members of this family infect the intestines of                    
              sharks and other elasmobranch fishes.  Dr. Janine Caira will be                
              investigating the evolutionary relationships among the species of              
              several genera of oncobothriids, and establishing their preferred              
              attachment sites within the spiral valves of the fish intestines.              
              Evolutionary relationships among the tapeworms will be                         
              reconstructed using data from electron microscopy, amino acid                  
              analysis of attachment hooks, and adult tapeworm morphology.                   
                   The data gathered on the morphology and protein chemistry of              
              the attachment hooks will advance our understanding of the                     
              systematics and evolution of the parasites, and of possible                    
              coevolutionary mechanisms that affect hosts and parasites.  A                  
              well-documented evolutionary reconstructions of the tapeworms                  
              can be compared to the ancestor-descendant relationships of the                
              host fishes.  Coevolution among hosts and parasites is a                       
              phenomenon with implications for many branches of biology.
