Abstract    :
              The International Conference on Computational Methods                          
              in Water Resources will be held during June 11-15, 1990                        
              in Venice, Italy.  This is a eighth in a series of meetings                    
              on finite elements methods in water resources which is                         
              being broadened starting with this meeting.  The problem                       
              areas to be covered include; groundwater flow, flow in                         
              lakes and estuaries, remote sensing, environmental                             
              systems analysis and optimization, and salt-water                              
              intrusion.  Significant effort have been expended in                           
              attracting leading international researchers to                                
              complement the broad focus of this meeting.  This is the                       
              major conference focusing on the computational-                                
              mathematical-water resources interface and this action                         
              provides partial travel and per-diem support for U.S.                          
              invited speakers, organizers, and student participants.                        
              The conference is being hosted by the Dipartimento di                          
              Metodi e Modelli Matematica per le Scienze Applicate,                          
              Universita degli Studi Padova.                                                 
                                                                                             
              In addition to the traditional presentations, this                             
              conference will include two forums in which the                                
              participants have been invited to solve " standard                             
              problems" in Supercomputing in Water Resources and                             
              Wave Propagation in Shallow Waters.  The purpose is to                         
              provide a systemic comparison of different numerical                           
              solution methods for problems difficult but important to                       
              water resources applications.
