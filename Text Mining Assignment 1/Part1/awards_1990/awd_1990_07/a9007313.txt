Abstract    :
              PIs' proposed the construction a high-energy backscatter imaging               
              system designed for nondestructive testing of metals and other high            
              density materials.  Such a system will be useful for applications              
              where high density prevents the use of Compton backscatter and                 
              where air gaps prevent the transmission of noise ratio because of              
              the high yield of electron/positron pairs from high-energy X-rays              
              and the near-isotropic nature of the resulting bremsstrahlung and              
              annihilation radiation.                                                        
                                                                                             
              PIs' previous Monte Carlo simulations show that this backscatter               
              system is capable of imaging materials to depths that permit the               
              exit of 0.511 MeV annihilation photons and bremsstrahlung photons              
              composed primarily of bremsstrahlung and positron-annihilation                 
              radiation, the spatial resolution and contrast discrimination of               
              the system are strongly dependent upon the mean free paths of the              
              electrons in the materials imaged.  For this reason, it is                     
              necessary to perform mathematical calibration of the raw scatter               
              profiles to obtain information about the shape, depth and                      
              composition of the subsurface components.  This technique has no               
              substitute in existing nondestructive testing.
