Abstract    :
                   The P.I. proposes to experimentally examine the influence of

              information and persistence of zooplankton patches.  Dispersal                 
              will be analyzed with several measures including the net                       
              horizontal displacement of individual zooplankton over a                       
              specified time.  Experiments will be conducted in large field                  
              enclosures (10,000) using the natural assemblage of plankton.                  
              Recent studies indicate that physical factors alone can not                    
              explain all of the of the observed small scale patchiness.                     
              However, very little is known of the influence of biotic factors
