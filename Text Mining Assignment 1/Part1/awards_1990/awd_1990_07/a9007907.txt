Abstract    :
              There is a considerable need for alternative techniques for                    
              the rapid separation of biological macromolecules.  The PI                     
              proposes using the principle of Lorentz forces (i.e., a                        
              combination of electrical and magnetic fields) to effect                       
              a separation.  While the theoretical basis for Lorentz                         
              forces is well known, its applicability to biological                          
              macromolecules has not been examined. This proposal seeks                      
              to test experimental conditions to demonstrate the                             
              feasibility of using Lorentz forces for biological                             
              separations.
