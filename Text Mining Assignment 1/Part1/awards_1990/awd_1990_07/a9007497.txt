Abstract    :
                   Prof. Gross will initiate a program of computational                      
              research in theoretical gravitational physics.  He will work on                
              numerical approaches to quantum gravity in both two and four                   
              dimensional space-times.                                                       
              This work will allow comparison between numerical and exact                    
              analytic results for the two dimensional case, as well as                      
              limiting studies to see if the numerical methods in four                       
              dimensions are in agreement with the continuum limit.
