Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              Anaphora has played a key role in studying language.  It is                    
              widely held that the study of anaphora can shed significant light              
              on the logic that underlies our linguistic capacities.  The                    
              investigators plans to see whether logics that are more "dynamic"              
              than classical logic (such as some of the logics designed to deal              
              with certain aspects of the semantics of programming languages)                
              are better designed for understanding anaphora.  He will start                 
              from Discourse Representation Theory and use dynamic logic to                  
              deal with some of the problems that it leaves open (such as the                
              interpretation of quantifiers like most).  He will then look into              
              other relevant issues such as the semantics of definite NPs                    
              (including definite descriptions, ordinary pronouns,                           
              interrogative pronouns and relative pronouns) and the semantics                
              of impersonal subjects (like si in Italian or on in French).                   
              These topics are important not only in their own right but also                
              because the provide crucial evidence in understanding the way in               
              which meaning is generally encoded in syntactic structure.
