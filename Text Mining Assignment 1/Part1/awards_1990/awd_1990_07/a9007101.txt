Abstract    :
              A series of computer experiments will be performed to explore                  
              heat transfer mechanisms close to the critical point of the H2O                
              system.   Many studies are now using dated equations of state                  
              whose quality is especially suspect in the near critical region;               
              the proposed experiments will either confirm their utility or                  
              demonstrate that they are woefully inadequate.  The role of the                
              critical point may be far more profound than previously thought;               
              conditions in hydrothermal systems may even be predictable by                  
              very simple formulations, thereby reducing enormous numerical                  
              computations to routing calculations.  Previous complications may              
              be a consequence of numerical inaccuracies caused by                           
              amplification of errors in the convection term in the equations                
              in the region of nonlinear fluid properties.  In other words,                  
              this work may result in improvement and simplification of models               
              used to represent ore-forming and geothermal systems in an                     
              important temperature-pressure region.
