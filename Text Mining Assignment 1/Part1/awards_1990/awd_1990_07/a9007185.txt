Abstract    :
              This award will support the efforts of the principal                           
              investigators to continue their studies of finite element methods              
              for the numerical solution of partial differential equations.                  
              In particular, the researchers will construct preconditioners                  
              that will enable them to solve the resulting systems of algebraic              
              equations more efficiently.  The theoretical insights gained from              
              their studies should lead to the development of improved software              
              for use on parallel computers, which in turn will lead to                      
              improved solutions of a host of problems in two and three space                
              dimensions. The computer has changed forever the way we go about               
              finding solutions of partial differential equations that arise in              
              science and technology.  Unfortunately the ability of even the                 
              most powerful supercomputer to solve complicated systems is                    
              limited very often by the sheer size of the algebraic equations                
              that result from discretizing the differential equations.  In                  
              order to overcome this "size" limitation numerical analysts have               
              devised ways to "precondition" these algebraic equations so as to              
              make them more digestible to the computer.  The principal                      
              investigators on this grant will seek better ways to achieve this              
              preconditioning.
