Abstract    :
              This award will support study of the Japanese language by an                   
              American scientist or engineer by providing a stipend,                         
              tuition, or other course-related expenses.  The objectives of                  
              the program are to enable active U.S. scientists and engineers                 
              to acquire sufficient familiarity with the language and                        
              customs of Japan to allow them to function independently                       
              there; or to acquire sufficient expertise in reading Japanese                  
              to be able to understand technical abstracts in their field                    
              of interest.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              There is a critical need for more effective technical                          
              communication between American and Japanese researchers.                       
              This award is intended to help remove language and cultural                    
              barriers to U.S.-Japanese cooperative research and to                          
              facilitate science and technology exchange.
