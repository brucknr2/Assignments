Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research project will conduct an ethnographic                
              study of households' budgeting decisions and the importance of                 
              trust, in relation to market factors, in informal lending                      
              practices in urban Zambia.  The questions asked are how personal               
              trust is used in informal and semi-formal credit relationships,                
              and how trust is maintained across changing and difficult                      
              economic situations.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Methods include participant observation, semi-structured                       
              interviews, survey sampling of a number of households, and an                  
              extensive period of budget recording and analysis of a smaller                 
              sample of households.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This research is important because informal economic relations                 
              are becoming more and more significant in both developed and                   
              developing countries as economies worsen.  Increased                           
              understanding of the strategies and issues that poor urban                     
              households follow in obtaining necessary cash for subsistence                  
              will help decision makers deal with potential causes of urban                  
              discontent.
