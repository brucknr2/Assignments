Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A class of massively parallel computers has been introduced over               
              the last several years in research projects and as commercial                  
              products.  The computers, designated as Single Instruction Stream              
              Multiple Data Stream (SIMD), offer an increase in performance and              
              a significant improvement in cost/performance.  Applications that              
              can exploit this high degree of parallelism can enjoy the economic             
              benefits of this cost/performance breakthrough.  The majority of               
              initial applications on these machines is in the hard sciences and             
              engineering fields.  However, our Phase I results showed that these            
              machines can be used for fast and efficient implementations of                 
              relational and post-relational database technology.  We are working            
              with a leading SIMD computer manufacturer, MasPar Computer Corp.,              
              to integrate our Phase I results into a complete database solution.            
              Phase II tasks will focus on implementation of a complete and                  
              demonstrable prototype.  The same cost/performance metrics that                
              will make this product a strong competitor in the commercial                   
              database market will lead to the next generation of database                   
              technology that will allow for storage of complex data objects.                
              This post-relational database model will allow for object-oriented             
              database implementation in diverse fields such as CAD/CAM systems,             
              genetic mapping, and image analysis applications.
