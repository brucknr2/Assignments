Abstract    :
                   The Flora of North America Project is a collaborative                     
              endeavor among U.S. and Canadian museums and universities to                   
              produce an authoritative taxonomic inventory of all species of                 
              vascular plants growing without cultivation in North America                   
              north of Mexico.  This would include all the ferns, gymnosperms                
              (conifers and cycads), and flowering plants, estimated at 17,000               
              to 20,000 species.  Twelve printed volumes and a computerized                  
              database are to be prepared, to contain morphological                          
              descriptions, chromosome numbers, geographic range, vernacular                 
              names, and habitat and phenological notes (seasonality of                      
              flowering and fruiting), all arranged within a modern taxonomic                
              system of classification.  The database will be maintained as an               
              ongoing resource and will provide easy access to the data for a                
              wide range of users.  Phase two activity includes editorial work,              
              preparation and illustration of species-level treatments,                      
              workshops for authors, and management of the database.  Groups of              
              plants that will receive attention during the grant period                     
              include Cyperaceae (sedge family), Fabaceae (bean family), and                 
              Rosaceae (rose family).                                                        
                   The Flora of North America project provides a synthesis of                
              up-to-date taxonomic information on the plants of the North                    
              American continent north of Mexico.  Such information will be of               
              use to resource managers, conservationists, those exploring                    
              economic and medicinal uses of plants, and research biologists.                
              The inventory will form the baseline data by which changes in                  
              local and global environmental conditions can be monitored, and                
              it will furnish a summary of the plant diversity of this                       
              continental region.
