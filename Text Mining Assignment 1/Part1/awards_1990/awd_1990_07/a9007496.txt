Abstract    :
              An ultrasonic Doppler velocimeter will be purchased and                        
              modified to measure velocity distributions in various slurry                   
              and sediment flows.  A proof of concept prototype of this                      
              device has been constructed and shown to work at a solids                      
              volume fraction of 50% and a penetration of 100mm in glass                     
              beads, water mixture.  The funds will be used to construct a                   
              working system for the particular slurry being studied, in                     
              terms of the choice of wave length and operating mode.  The                    
              measurements performed with the ultrasonic device will be                      
              compared to the results obtained with another non-intrusive                    
              method, namely magnetic resonance imaging.                                     
                                                                                             
              The proposed ultrasonic velocimeter will provide a non-                        
              intrusive tool to measure in real time the velocity                            
              distribution of solid phase in highly concentrated solid-                      
              liquid flows.
