Abstract    :
              In this project ("The Kinetics of Isomer-Specific Oxygen                       
              Exchange Reactions of Optically Active Alcohols as a Function                  
              of Acid-Catalyzed Racemization") in the Organic Dynamics                       
              Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Margaret V.                       
              Merritt of the Chemistry Department at Wellesley College will                  
              determine the rate constants for oxygen exchange for  isomers                  
              as a function of racemization of a series of chiral alcohols.                  
              These detailed kinetic studies will enhance the understanding                  
              of reaction mechanisms and reaction intermediates in these and                 
              related systems.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The rate constants for oxygen exchange as a function of                        
              racemization of a series of chiral alcohols will be used to                    
              probe the structural features that lead to asymmetric solvation                
              of carbocation intermediates and to investigate the structure                  
              of water within the solvation sphere.  The mechanistic                         
              conclusions will be based on the microscopic rate constants for                
              three competing processes at the alpha carbon atom and the                     
              oxygen isotope effects for these processes.  The three                         
              competing processes being studied are substitution (O-18                       
              exchange) without inversion, substitution (O-18 exchange) with                 
              retention, and inversion without substitution.
