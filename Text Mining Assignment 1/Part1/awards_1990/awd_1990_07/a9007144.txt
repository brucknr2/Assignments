Abstract    :
                   Five related projects are proposed for a leaf mine-oak tree               
              system in which we will attempt to determine whether leaf-to-                  
              leaf, tree-to-tree, and tree-species-to-tree species preferences               
              of leaf miners results from differential egg hatching,                         
              differential larval performance, differential pupal mortality, or              
              differences in movement of adult moths between trees.  Previous                
              research has shown that leaf miners show a distinct preference                 
              for different species of tree, different individual trees within               
              a species and different types of leaf within a tree.  Such                     
              preferences are maintained year after year.  Investigations into               
              such factors as leaf abscission, predation, parasitism, and host               
              quality of leaves as measured by amino acid content do not                     
              explain preferences of leaf miners for certain leaves or trees.                
              The propose to move miner eggs between leaves, between individual              
              trees, and between tree species.  They also plan to move pupae                 
              between trees and to mark pupae with heavy metals to determine                 
              movement rates of adult moths that we will catch with sticky                   
              traps.  Such research will greatly increase of knowledge of                    
              forest dynamics.
