Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                   
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, Derek J. Hodgson of the                      
              University of Wyoming will investigate the synthesis of                        
              binuclear coordination compounds of manganese in moderately                    
              high oxidation states. The structures, oxidation-reduction                     
              properties and the electrochemical behavior of these complexes                 
              will be examined. The compounds may be useful as                               
              electrocatalytic oxidants. They are also of interest bcause                    
              they are related to the manganese compounds of Photosystem II,                 
              which is involved in photosynthesis.                                           
                                                                                             
              The complexes to be investigated are mu-dioxo dimers of                        
              manganese(III/III), manganese(III,IV) and manganese(IV,IV) with                
              auxiliary tetradentate ligands containing four nitrogen donor                  
              atoms. These non-porphyrinic ligands will be modified with                     
              various substituents and other structural changes so as to                     
              cause the redox behavior of the complexes to vary in a                         
              predictable manner.
