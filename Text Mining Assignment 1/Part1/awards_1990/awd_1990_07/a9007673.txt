Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Dr. Joshua L. Goodman of the University of                  
              Rochester.  This work will improve our basic understanding of                  
              the fundamental processes by which chemical reactions occur.                   
                                                                                             
              The experiments that will be carried out by Dr. Goodman will                   
              utilize time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry, which allows                  
              measurement of microscopic volume changes of a system following                
              photoexcitation.  The magnitude of these volume changes can be                 
              related to reaction enthalpies and to volume changes involving                 
              reactive intermediates.  The investigation will focus on                       
              processes involving ion radicals and carbenes.  A new two-laser                
              system will be developed in which the first laser pulse is used                
              to generate the reactive intermediate and a second laser pulse                 
              is employed to photoexcite the intermediate.
