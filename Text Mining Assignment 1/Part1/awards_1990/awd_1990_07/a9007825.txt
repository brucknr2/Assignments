Abstract    :
              To characterize and understand fully the microscopic magnetic                  
              properties of the CuO2 materials as a function of hole density in              
              the hope of thereby arriving at a detailed understanding of high-              
              temperature superconductivity.  Secondly, high-resolution,                     
              magnetic x-ray-scattering studies of diluted magnets in an                     
              external field.
