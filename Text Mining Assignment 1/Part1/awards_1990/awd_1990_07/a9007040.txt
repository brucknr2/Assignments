Abstract    :
                   The P.I.'s will analyze historical changes and interactions               
              between land-use practices and forest vegetation in central New                
              England.  An area that encompasses significant gradients in                    
              environmental factors and cultural activity.  Specific objectives              
              include: (1) examination of differences in the rate and degree of              
              forest clearance and farm abandonment across the region, (2)                   
              determination of the relative contribution of economic forces                  
              versus physical constraints on these processes, and (3)                        
              investigation of the effect of land-use history on the current                 
              structure of the modern vegetation.  Data will include numerous                
              historical sources collected on a township basis and spatial                   
              analysis will utilize geographic information system.  The results              
              of the research will provide information on long-term changes in               
              the environment,  and how these are mediated by human activities.
