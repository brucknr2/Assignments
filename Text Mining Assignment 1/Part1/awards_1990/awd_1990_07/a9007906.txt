Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In 1989, Dr. Robert Blumenschine, in collaboration with Tanzanian              
              scientists, began a long-term archaeological project at Olduvai                
              Gorge, Tanzania.  The goal of the research is to survey across an              
              exposed paleo-landscape and to examine the distribution of faunal              
              and humanly derived artifactual material.  On this basis, it                   
              should be possible to determine how the very early humans who                  
              inhabited this region over 1 million years ago subsisted and were              
              able to survive with extremely simple technology in a difficult                
              environment.  The first exploratory phase of this project met                  
              with great success, and Dr. Blumenschine now wishes to initiate a              
              much larger second phase.  However, because of disagreements                   
              between Tanzanian government authorities, it is very uncertain                 
              whether a permit will be issued to allow continuation of the                   
              research.  The situation requires skillful advocacy and                        
              negotiation by Dr. Blumenschine, and the funds provided by this                
              award will allow him to travel to Tanzania and speak directly to               
              the relevant individuals.  It is unlikely that any other course                
              of action will permit research to continue in 1990.                            
                                                                                             
              This award is necessary to facilitate continued research at one                
              of the most important known archaeological sites.
