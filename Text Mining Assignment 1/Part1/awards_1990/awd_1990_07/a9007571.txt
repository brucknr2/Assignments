Abstract    :
                   The research emphasized detailed studies of elastic, and                  
              superelastic collisions of electrons with laser excited atoms,                 
              including measurements of azimuthal effects.  These are a                      
              sensitive probe of the details of the interactions between the                 
              free and bound electron during the collision.  Atomic beam                     
              recoil spectroscopy is exploited to perform absolute cross                     
              section measurements.  The experimental geometry enables the                   
              study of ionization of laser excited Na, including the angular                 
              distribution of the scattered electrons.                                       
                   In addition, earlier polarizability measurements will be                  
              extended to the study of atomic clusters of up to order five                   
              for alkali metals and alkali halides.
