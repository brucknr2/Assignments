Abstract    :
              This is part of a joint project at Cornell and Duke Universities               
              to continue the successful research on custom hardware for solid               
              modelling.  Duke is extending and improving the hardware itself,               
              while Cornell is building software for constructive solid geometry             
              (CSG), integrating the resulting system with applications, and                 
              conducting field tests.  The initial 8-processor system is being               
              upgraded to 256 processors, to allow parallel processing of more               
              complex objects.  At the same time, the numerical precision of the             
              hardware is being increased, and a tag system is included to allow             
              the processors to keep track of software-specified properties of               
              parts of objects.  The software and applications are being extended            
              not only to use these hardware changes, but also to include                    
              algorithmic improvements.  Among the improvements foreseen are                 
              enhanced ability to translate from other representations, such as              
              nurbs (non-uniform recursive B-splines) and boundary                           
              representations, into the CSG trees that are used by this system.
