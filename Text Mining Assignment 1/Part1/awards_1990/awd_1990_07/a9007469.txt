Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator is continuing his work in                      
              theoretical probability.  He will be collaborating with a number               
              of different scientists on problems relating to limit theorems                 
              of independent random variables.  These problems arose                         
              originally from questions in mathematical statistics.  In                      
              particular, he will work on problems dealing with refinements of               
              the Berry-Essen theorem, strong limit theorems, and multilinear                
              forms.
