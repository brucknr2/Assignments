Abstract    :
                   This project is exploring two simple and powerful coding                  
              ideas.  The first involves staged power transfer from an outer to              
              an inner code and can find use on both trellis and conventional                
              convolutionally coded systems.  This new technique not only                    
              improves the performance of concatenated coding systems in their               
              usual operating regime, i.e., very low decoded error rates, but                
              also extends their use to the less stringent requirements of                   
              uncompressed images or speech where decoder complexity and short               
              delays are important.  Satellite based mobile telephone or data                
              service could benefit immediately from these techniques.                       
                   The second idea is a method of sharing parity checks among                
              the members of a set of Reed-Solomon codewords.  The effect is a               
              decrease in the amount of reduncancy required, i.e., an increase               
              in the rate of the code.  The greatest need for this technique                 
              comes from systems where the symbol size is in some way dictated               
              by the channel, e.g., an 8 bit Reed Solomon code with 256-ary                  
              p.p.m. on a photon counting optical channel.  Even if the symbol               
              size is not constrained, i.e., larger Reed Solomon codes could be              
              used, both the encoder and decoder complexity measured in                      
              operations per information bit of the new method appear to be                  
              lower for the same performance gain.
