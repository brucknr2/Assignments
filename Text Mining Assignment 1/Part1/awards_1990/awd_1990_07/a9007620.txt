Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Loeser will develop a                        
              promising new, alternative method for predicting the electronic                
              structures and associated properties of large chemical systems.                
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The research will involve the further development and                          
              applications of the dimensional continuation method.  The                      
              applications fall into two areas.  First, recent work on the                   
              correlation energies of many electron atoms will be extended.                  
              Second, work on electron correlation in metallic hydrogen will                 
              be used to estimate the effects of correlation of the recently                 
              observed metallic transition and on structural phase                           
              transitions within the metal.  Some aspects of the dynamics of                 
              electron correlation in this prototypical solid will also be                   
              examined.  The longer-range goal of the research is to develop                 
              a general treatment of electron correlation in crystalline                     
              solids.
