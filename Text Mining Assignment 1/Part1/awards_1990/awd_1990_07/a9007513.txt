Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                 The North American fish fauna provides an informative,                     
              natural laboratory useful in investigations of comparative,                    
              evolutionary, and -- phylogenetic relationships.  Without these                
              data the fauna is rendered inaccessible for direct estimates of                
              community formation, evolutionary ecology, and modes and rates of              
              speciation.  Fishes of the family Percidae represent one of the                
              most diverse groups in North America, yet relationships among                  
              many of the species are poorly known.  The objectives of this                  
              study are to test previous biogeographic and evolutionary                      
              relationships hypothesis for several darter species, using starch              
              gel electrophoresis and phylogenetic analyses.  Relationships                  
              within and between the target species are extremely useful in                  
              resolving recently constructed area (river) cladograms for many                
              drainages in eastern North America that dated the origin of the                
              fauna well before the Pleistocene.  The study will focus on two                
              wide-spread species of the percid genus Etheostoma, the                        
              relationships of species within the subgenus Etheostoma (genus                 
              Etheostoma), and the phyletic affinities of this clade to the                  
              subgenus Ulocentra (or Nanostoma).  The potential gains of the                 
              study are not restricted to revised taxonomy and relationships of              
              traditionally confusing group.  The analysis will supply both a                
              framework for future systematic studies in percid fishes and                   
              improve our understanding of evolutionary biology.
