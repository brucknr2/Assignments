Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Materials Chemistry and Chemical                     
              Processing Initiative in support of the collaborative research                 
              of Professors Callstrom and McCreery at Ohio State University.                 
              Joint funding is provided by the Divisions of Chemistry,                       
              Materials Research, and Chemical and Thermal Systems. The                      
              thrust of the research is the development of new synthetic                     
              routes to doped glassy carbon materials and an investigation of                
              their properties. These engineered materials are likely to find                
              use as catalytic electrodes.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Doped glassy carbon materials will be prepared at low                          
              temperatures by thermal decomposition of poly(aryl-                            
              diacetylenes) that are amenable to orientation in order to                     
              control the structure of the resultant carbon materials.                       
              Transition metals with catalytic activity towards                              
              hydrogenation, dioxygen reduction and methanol oxidation will                  
              be covalently bound to the diacetylene polymers, prior to                      
              decomposition to specifically control their concentration and                  
              activity in the glassy carbon materials.
