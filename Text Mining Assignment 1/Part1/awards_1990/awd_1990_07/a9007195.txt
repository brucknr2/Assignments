Abstract    :
              This research investigates theoretical and practical issues in the             
              design and evaluation of parallel algorithms, and involves cooperative         
              work in theory and systems.  The project ideally has four objectives.          
              First, to develop a high level language for expressing parallel                
              algorithms such that there is a natural correspondence between                 
              algorithmic concepts and programming language constructs and an                
              algorithm can be expressed without forcing a serialization.  Second,           
              to study and develop techniques for mapping algorithms expressed in            
              this high level notation to various architectures subject to simple            
              user specified constraints.  Third, to study instrumentation                   
              techniques for monitoring an algorithm's runtime behaviour on a given          
              architecture.  Fourth, to investigate issues related to giving high            
              level visual feedback to the user on the performance of implementation         
              of his or her algorithm on a specific architecture.  These will set up         
              an interactive loop between the user and the system that will enable           
              rapid design and prototyping of parallel algorithms.
