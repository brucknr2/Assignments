                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  This grant will enable the Principal Investigator to                      
              complete work in progress on the principles of metrical stress                 
              theory, a theory of a significant component of the phonology of                
              natural languages.  This is an integrated theory of word stress,               
              in which individual stress rules are analyzed as the result of                 
              setting values for a small number of parameters.                               
                                                                                             
                   The evidence for the theory consists of detailed studies of               
              the stress systems of a number of languages, aloong with sketches              
              of the systems of a larger number of less well documented                      
              languages.                                                                     
                                                                                             
                   The core of the theory is a particular set of templates for               
              parsing syllables into stress feet.  Other ideas developed                     
              include a prohibition on feet consisting of a single light                     
              syllable; an algorithm for deriving stresses spaced at                         
              trisyllabic intervals; and the use of moraic theory to analyze                 
              contextually varying syllable quantity.                                        
                                                                                             
                   The outcome of the project will be a book, Principles of                  
              Metrical Stress Theory, which will serve as both an integrated                 
              exposition of the theory and as a textbook for graduate training               
              in phonology.
