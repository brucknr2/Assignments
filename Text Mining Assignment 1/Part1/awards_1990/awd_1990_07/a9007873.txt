Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The work proposed will complete the dissertation research of                   
              Miguel Goni on geochemical applications of the 75-100 reaction                 
              products (in addition to simple phenols) that are obtained from                
              the CuO method sued to characterize lignins in environmental                   
              samples.  To date, the P.I.'s have found CuO reaction product                  
              mixtures from soils and sediments to include compounds derived                 
              from specific amino acids, lipids, cutins, and kelps, along                    
              with an extensive suite of lignin-derived phenolic dimers.                     
              Three papers describing the cutin work are now submitted and a                 
              manuscript on the geochemistries of the amino acid reaction                    
              products is in preparation.  The P.I.'s propose to wrap up this                
              project by investigating the suites of CuO reaction products:                  
              (a) compounds that appear to be unique to kelps and (b) the                    
              lignin dimers, which potentially carry novel geochemical                       
              information.
