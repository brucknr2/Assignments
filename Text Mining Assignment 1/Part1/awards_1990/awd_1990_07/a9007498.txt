Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  On September 17-18, 1989, Hurricane Hugo almost completely                
              deforested portions of the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto              
              Rico.  Hurricane deforestation differs substantially from other                
              disturbances that have been studied in tropical forests (logging,              
              slash and burn agriculture) principally in that an enormous                    
              amount of live biomass instantly enters the surface litter                     
              compartment.  Insufficient data exist to predict how this litter               
              input will affect or be affected by nutrient dynamics in the                   
              riparian zone of this tropical forest.                                         
                   Drs. McDowell, Bowden and Smith have been sampling near-                  
              surface ground water and stream water at two sites in this forest              
              since August 1988.  Their work emphasizes the nutrient and water               
              flux through the riparian zone and assesses the relative                       
              importance of microbial versus vascular plant control of nutrient              
              flux through this interface.                                                   
                   This new project will examine the impact of deforestation                 
              caused by Hurricane Hugo on the ability of riparian zones to                   
              regulate transport of nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic                    
              ecosystems.  The investigators hypothesize that the riparian                   
              zone plays a crucial role in regulating losses of nitrogen                     
              following this catastrophic disturbance.  They specifically                    
              identify two major hypotheses: 1) deforestation associated with                
              Hurricane Hugo will result in increased fluvial export of                      
              nitrogen from the Bisley watershed, and 2) the magnitude of                    
              nitrogen export in stream water will be lessened significantly by              
              nitrogen retention and transformation.  To test these hypotheses,              
              information from before and after Hurricane Hugo will be compared              
              at two sites, one disturbed and one undisturbed.                               
                   The scientists engaged in this research are experienced,                  
              productive researchers who have previous experience with riparian              
              processes in tropical forests.  The program is supported by                    
              excellent institutional facilities.
