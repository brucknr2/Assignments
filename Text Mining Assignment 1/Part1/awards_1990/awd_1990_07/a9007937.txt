Abstract    :
              Under this award Professor George Collins of the Department of                 
              Electrical Engineering, Colorado State University (CSU), will                  
              spend twelve months in Japan, commencing in May 1991, at the                   
              Research Laboratory of Engineering Materials, Tokyo Institute of               
              Technology (TIT), where he will work with Professor Hideomi                    
              Koinuma on developing information relevant to the epitaxial                    
              growth of compound semiconductor films at reduced temperature.                 
              The research will employ a near afterglow H2 plasma source                     
              developed at Colorado State University, which will be placed in                
              an existing Tokyo University OMCVD reactor to achieve epitaxial                
              films of GaAs on ZnSe and Si, while the ZnSe will be deposited on              
              GaAs.  The feedstock precursors will be limited to only organ                  
              metallic gases of methyl and ethyl compounds.  Near afterglow                  
              OMVD has hither to been largely unexplored despite its capability              
              to provide a lower deposition temperature; in-situ H2 plasma                   
              cleaning of substrate prior to growth; in-situ hydride and                     
              hydride radical (e.g. AsH2, AsH, etc.) generation; and lower                   
              residual carbon both at interfaces and in bulk films.  The role                
              of the hydrogen will be delineated for both gas phase OMCVD                    
              reactions, formation of AsHx radicals, as well as carbon                       
              gasification reactions via mass spectroscopic deuterium isotope                
              tracer studies.  All gas phase studies will be correlated to                   
              deposited film properties material characterization at Tokyo                   
              University will emphasize:  photoluminescence, double crystal x-               
              ray diffraction and SIMS.
