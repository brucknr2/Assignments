Abstract    :
              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the                
              research of Drs. Paul F. Hudrlik and Anne M. Hudrlik of the                    
              Department of Chemistry at Howard University.  The Hudrliks'                   
              program has the long term objective of determining the                         
              reactivity of organic compounds containing silicon, with a view                
              toward developing new reactions and reaction sequences of                      
              potential utility in organic synthesis.                                        
                                                                                             
              The current work focuses on the investigation of compounds                     
              having silicon groups which are expected to be more reactive                   
              than trimethylsilyl.  These include silicon compounds with a                   
              protected internal nucleophile and silacyclobutanes.
