Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                   
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, Gerard Parkin of Columbia                    
              University will investigate the exploratory synthetic and                      
              mechanistic aspects of monomeric hydride and alkyl derivatives                 
              of main group metal compounds. These compounds may have                        
              application as reagents for selective organic reactions and as                 
              precursors for the formation of ceramic materials.                             
                                                                                             
              Main group metals (with emphasis on magnesium, aluminum, zinc                  
              and lithium) will be complexed with bulky tris-pyrazolylborate                 
              ligands to assure their monomeric nature and the hydride,                      
              alkyl, silyl, methylidene (=CHR), phosphinidene (=PR), oxo (=O)                
              and nitrido derivatives will be synthesized and their chemical                 
              reactivity systematically investigated. These investigations                   
              will include mechanistic studies and the search for new                        
              materials, catalysts and ceramic precursors.
