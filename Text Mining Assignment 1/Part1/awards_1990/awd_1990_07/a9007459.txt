Abstract    :
                   This research project is in the field of representation                   
              theory and harmonic analysis on real reductive Lie groups and                  
              other reductive algebraic groups.  Principal investigator Adams                
              will continue his study of Arthur's conjectures and unipotent                  
              representations for real groups.  Also, Adams' research will                   
              involve an examination of the role of L-groups in reductive dual               
              pairs, both for real groups, and over finite and p-adic fields.                
              Investigator Herb will continue her study of the Schwarz space                 
              for semisimple Lie groups with infinite center.  These problems                
              require showing how wave packets patch together at points where                
              different series of tempered representations overlap.  Also, this              
              research involves an examination of supertempered representations              
              in the context of Fourier inversion of orbital integrals for p-                
              adic groups.                                                                   
                   This research is in the general area of modern analysis and,              
              in particular, in obtaining the representations of groups of                   
              transformations on spaces.
