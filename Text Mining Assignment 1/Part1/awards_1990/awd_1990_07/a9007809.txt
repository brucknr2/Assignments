Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Bouman plans to continue his                 
              study of the way in which a wide variety of molecules respond                  
              to externally applied magnetic and electric fields.  Properties                
              to be studied include nuclear magnetic shielding, static and                   
              dynamic polarizabilities, electronic oscillator and rotatory                   
              strengths, and vibrational circular dichroism.                                 
                                                                                             
              The work is based on a localized molecular orbital approach to                 
              linear response properties, using both correlated and                          
              uncorrelated wavefunctions.  The major focus is on calculation                 
              and analysis of the nature of nuclear magnetic shielding                       
              tensors, as well as the study of electronic spectra and                        
              vibrational circular dichroism.  This study will culminate in                  
              the extension of the popular RPAC computer code for the                        
              computation of these properties.
