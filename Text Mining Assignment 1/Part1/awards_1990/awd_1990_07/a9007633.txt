Abstract    :
                   Many cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) produce a yellow                    
              pigment in the sheaths or capsules surrounding their cells when                
              exposed to high intensity sunlight.  The goal of this project is               
              to determine the chemical nature of this pigment, and to assess                
              its effectiveness in protecting these organisms from the harmful               
              effects of short wave solar radiation, in particular, ultra-                   
              violet radiation.  The experiments will use laboratory cultures                
              and will determine the various effects of normal and enhanced                  
              levels of ultra-violet radiation on photosynthesis, growth , and               
              survival, with and without the protective pigment.                             
                   This research is particularly relevant because stratospheric              
              ozone depletion may result in significantly greater levels of                  
              ultra-violet radiation.  It is important to understand all the                 
              "strategies" employed by living organisms to protect against this              
              potentially damaging radiation.  Shielding by sheath pigments in               
              cyanobacteria may represent one of the earliest and most                       
              primitive adaptations to excess light and short-wave radiation.
