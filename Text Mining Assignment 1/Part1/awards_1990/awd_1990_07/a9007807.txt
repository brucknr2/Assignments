Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with understanding the mechanism of                  
              initiation of mRNA translation in eucaryotic cells.  By                        
              understanding the regulation of translation we will better                     
              understand how viral infected cells inhibit normal protein                     
              synthesis and preferentially translate viral RNAs and how growth               
              and development are regulated.  The first part of this project                 
              involves describing the molecular mechanism for initiation factor              
              eIF-4E binding to 5' mRNA terminal cap analogs.  The binding of                
              eIF-4E will be monitored by changes in protein fluorescence, cap               
              analog fluorescence, and circular dichroism.  The effects of pH,               
              ionic strength, and temperature will be examined.  From these                  
              data it will be determined if there is a preferred conformation                
              of the cap that is recognized by iIF-4E, the structural features               
              of the cap important for binding,and the relative affinity of                  
              various cap derivatives.                                                       
                                                                                             
              After characterizing these initial reactions, the structural                   
              features of mRNA necessary for binding will be examined by using               
              oligonucleotides with defined structural differences.  The                     
              effects of other initiation factors and phosphorylation of eIF-4E              
              on cap recognition will be tested.  These interactions will be                 
              quantitated by direct determination of equilbrium constants.                   
              Such studies will lead to a more precise description of the                    
              mechanism of initiation of translation.  This information may be               
              applicable to other protein-nucleic acid interactions.
