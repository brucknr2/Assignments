Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to carry out                          
              fundamental studies to characterize intrinsic kinetics and                     
              adsorption parameters for proteins in ion exchange and                         
              affinity chromatography systems.  The PI also proposes to                      
              establish the methodology for designing large-scale                            
              chromatography for proteins.  Several model proteins which                     
              have well characterized molecular weights, isoelectric                         
              points, amino acid sequences, and three dimensional                            
              structures will be studied.  Computer simulations which                        
              have been previously developed for isocratic operations                        
              will be extended to gradient elution systems.  Nonlinear                       
              isotherms, size exclusion, mass transfer resistances, slow                     
              adsorption-desorption kinetics, and other time-dependent                       
              adsorption phenomena such as protein aggregation and                           
              conformational changes will be considered in the model.                        
              The model and simulations will be validated with column                        
              experiments on ion exchange and affinity chromatography.                       
              After validation, the simulations can be used for designing                    
              more efficient and cost-effective processes by choosing                        
              appropriate design and operating parameters, such as buffer                    
              pH, types of buffer, salt concentration, feed size,                            
              particle size, and flow rate.
