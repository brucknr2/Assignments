Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to add several important pieces of                         
              equipment to existing laboratories.  The research areas                        
              range from insect cell culture to the interaction of                           
              mammalian cells with polymer surfaces to studies of                            
              microorganisms from extreme environments. The equipment                        
              requested to support these projects includes a Fast                            
              Performance Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) system and                            
              associated protein purification items, a mid-size autoclave                    
              for sterilization of fermentation vessels, an ELISA                            
              microplate reader, a lyophilizer, a scintillation counter                      
              and other supporting equipment.  This equipment will                           
              supplement existing facilities and help to expand current                      
              biochemical engineering research efforts.
