Abstract    :
                   Professor Archdeacon will study width parameters of embedded              
              graphs, embedding properties of covering graphs and the lifting                
              properties of embedded graphs.  The proposed research studies                  
              new techniques for coverings and wrapped coverings and applies                 
              these techniques to topological graph theory.                                  
                   Graph Theory goes back perhaps two hundred years, but only                
              in the last half-century has the field become an active, fertile,              
              and flourishing branch of mathematics. A graph is a network of                 
              lines ("edges") joining points ("vertices"), thus the language of              
              graphs becomes a natural way of describing interrelationships                  
              among separated objects. Graph Theory figures most prominently                 
              as an essential tool in Communications Theory and  Computer                    
              Science.
