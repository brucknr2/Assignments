Abstract    :
                   The object of this study is to identify and map the                       
              ionospheric signatures of the dayside magnetospheric cusp and                  
              cleft.  A six-hour flight at constant noon magnetic local time by              
              the instrumented airborne Ionospheric Observatory (AIO) of the                 
              Geophysics Laboratory will make synoptic observation  in this                  
              important region of the magnetosphere (other ground -based and                 
              satellite-based data will also be available).  The focus of the                
              study will be to organize and analyze the data obtained on the                 
              AIO and other available sources and to present the results at a                
              GEM (Geospace Environment Modelling) Workshop which is scheduled               
              for the Fall of 1990. ***//
