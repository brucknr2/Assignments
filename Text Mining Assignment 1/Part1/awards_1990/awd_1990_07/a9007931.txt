Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the purchase of a computer to be use             
              in the analysis of data generated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance                
              (NMR) spectrometry in the study of the structure of proteins in                
              solution.  Determination of the three dimensional structure of                 
              biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids, and its                        
              relationship to the biological function of the polymers, is a                  
              central problem in modern biology.  Many investigators now see the             
              use of NMR as a highly promising approach to studies of the native             
              structure of a variety of biomolecules.  However, further                      
              refinement of experimental techniques and the analytical tools                 
              needed for interpretation of the spectroscopic data is central to              
              progress in the application of this powerful approach.  Crucial to             
              this has been the development of advanced, high frequency NMR                  
              spectrometers and the availability of powerful, relatively                     
              inexpensive computers able to handle the extensive and complex                 
              calculations that are needed for the interpretation task.
