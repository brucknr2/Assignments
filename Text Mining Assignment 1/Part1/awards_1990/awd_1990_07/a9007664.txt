Abstract    :
              An international conference is proposed on "Multicellular                      
              Behavior of Bacterial: In Nature, Industry and the Laboratory" to              
              be held at Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory.  October 21-               
              25, 1990.  The objective of the conference is to examine the                   
              importance of bacterial multicellularity in a wide range of                    
              situations, including environmental biofilms, mats and colonies,               
              bioreactors, bacterial pathogenesis and bacterial development on               
              laboratory media.  This is the first conference devoted specially              
              to consideration of bacteria as multicellular organisms.  The                  
              meeting has been organized to stimulate interaction between                    
              scientists who study bacterial multicellularity from different                 
              perspectives, such as fermentation and bioreactor engineers,                   
              molecular biologists interested in signal transduction, microbial              
              ecologists, medical microbiologists, etc.  It is expected that                 
              new insights will emerge into the roles of cell-cell                           
              communication and multicellular organization in bacterial                      
              activity, thereby helping to generate new concepts and research                
              strategies relevant to a wide range of disciplines.  Areas where               
              the ideas generated at the meeting may be applied in practice                  
              include biofouling, bioreactor design, biodeterioration and                    
              corrosion.
