Abstract    :
              A new instruction-level parallel (ILP) architecture called XIMD is             
              proposed.  This architecture model can provide better performance              
              and efficiency for a broader range of applications than traditional            
              scalar uniprocessors including pipelined RISC.  The XIMD                       
              architecture employs multiple functional units and can support the             
              concurrent execution of a variable number of instruction streams.              
              The regularity and simplicity of its hardware implementation makes             
              it highly scalable and retargetable to accommodate diverse                     
              application code characteristics.  Currently, the XIMD architecture            
              model is being developed and evaluated.  A functional level                    
              simulator for a baseline XIMD architecture is being implemented.               
              Using this simulator the performance and efficiency of the XIMD can            
              be quantitatively analyzed.  A practical prototype XIMD machine is             
              also being designed.  Implementation feasibility and achievable                
              performance using currently available parts are being assessed.                
              Compilation methodology and techniques to support the XIMD                     
              architecture model are also being investigated.
