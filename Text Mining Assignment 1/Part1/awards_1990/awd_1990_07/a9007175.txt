Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Materials Chemistry and Chemical                     
              Processing Initiative in support of the collaborative research                 
              of Professors Schrock, Cohen and Silbey at MIT. Joint funding                  
              is provided by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials                        
              Research. The thrust of the research is the synthesis and study                
              of semiconductor clusters of uniform size. These clusters are                  
              expected to have properties markedly different from the same                   
              bulk materials.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Ring-opening metathesis polymerization by well-characterized                   
              molybdenum catalysts will be used to prepare block copolymers                  
              with morphologies consisting of uniform sized spheres within a                 
              host polymer matrix.  The spherical regions will contain main                  
              group metals covalently attached to each monomeric unit in the                 
              region.  The host polymer will be a hydrocarbon. Block                         
              copolymer films will be treated with hydrogen sulfide in order                 
              to generate uniform sized clusters within the spheres.  Optical                
              spectra will be acquired and evaluated using theoretical                       
              techniques.  Selenides, tellurides, phosphides and arsenides of                
              a variety of main group elements should be preparable using                    
              similar approaches. Lead sulfide clusters with an average size                 
              of 30 angstroms have been prepared in a polynorbornene film.
