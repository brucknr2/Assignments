Abstract    :
              This project considers the problem of displaying a series of views of          
              a polyhedral scene from the vantage point of a moving viewer, called           
              "animating viewer motion."  The investigator has previously shown how          
              to take advantage of frame-to-frame coherence to animate viewer                
              motion for the restricted case of parallel projection, viewer                  
              rotations only, and rendering via line drawings with hidden lines              
              removed, resulting in the only efficient algorithm for this case.  The         
              algorithm has been implemented and shown to be practical.  Several             
              extensions to this work, including more sophisticated rendering,               
              perspective projection, and arbitrary viewer motions, will be studied.
