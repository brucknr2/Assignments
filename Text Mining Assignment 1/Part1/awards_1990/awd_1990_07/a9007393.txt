Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Davidson will continue his                   
              development and application of new methodologies in the field                  
              of quantum chemistry for the purpose of understanding the very                 
              fundamental inner workings of molecules.                                       
                                                                                             
              In the new grant period efforts will be focused on developing                  
              and testing methods for predicting molecular properties of                     
              excited states, large molecules, molecules containing heavy                    
              atoms, and weakly interacting species.  Of particular interest                 
              will be (e,2e) momentum distributions of small molecules, spin                 
              distributions in cationic magnesium clusters, and the source of                
              metal-ligand bonding in the 3d transition metals.
