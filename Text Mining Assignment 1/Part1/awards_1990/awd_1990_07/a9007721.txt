Abstract    :
                   It is proposed to study the scattering of spin-polarized                  
              electrons from atomic targets, both in the ground state and in                 
              metastable excited states.  In this way one can probe the                      
              spin-dependent properties of collision systems.  One                           
              manifestation is the fine structure effect, which results in                   
              asymmetric scattering of polarized electrons by unpolarized                    
              atoms, even when relativistic effects in the collision are                     
              negligible.  It is planned to investigated the asymmetry in a                  
              series of noble gases from Ne to Xe, allowing an assessment of                 
              the relativistic versus fine structure effects as target Z                     
              increases.
