Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this Phase II program, the feasibility of developing and                    
              characterizing highly sensitive and high speed non-thermal                     
              quantum detectors in the 1-10 um wavelength region using high                  
              temperature Bi-Ca-Sr-Cu-O superconducting thin film, will be                   
              examined.  These materials, because of the low band gap energy                 
              and resistance are inherently capable of detecting extremely high              
              speed signals (GHz) over a wide wavelength range down to 100 um.               
              Furthermore, the high transition temperature allows them to                    
              operate efficiently at liquid nitrogen temperature without any                 
              compromise on their characteristics.  In the program, extremely                
              smooth and optically semi-transparent superconducting film as                  
              thin as 80 nm will be deposited on suitable substrates by plasma               
              assisted laser deposition technique.  In order to improve the                  
              responsivity of the detector, these films will be patterned in a               
              meander shape by laser induced etching process.  Both nanosecond               
              and picosecond laser pulses at various wavelengths ranging from                
              0.3 um to 10.6 um will be used to measure the temporal as well as              
              wavelength dependence of the non-equilibrium response.  The                    
              responsivity of the detector is estimated to be 10000 v/w with                 
              ultimate response time of 1 picosecond.
