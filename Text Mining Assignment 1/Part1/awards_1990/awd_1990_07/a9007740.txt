Abstract    :
                   This award will support the publication of the proceedings                
              of the Workshop on Phi Factories and Related Physics Issues -                  
              UCLA; April 20-27, 1990.  The Workshop addresses the theory and                
              experimental issues related to increased precision in the test                 
              of the discrete symmetries of nature namely Charge Conjugation,                
              Parity, Time Reversal (CPT) and the product Charge Conjugation                 
              Parity (CP).  A review of the theoretical arguments for the CPT                
              conservation and for the observed phenomenology in the K meson                 
              system is treated.  A detailed evaluation of the various design                
              approaches for a phi meson factory with sufficient intensity                   
              for probing these symmetries of nature at very high precision                  
              is given.
