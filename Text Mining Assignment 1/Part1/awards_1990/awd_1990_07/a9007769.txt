Abstract    :
              Dr. Laurie J. Butler is supported by a grant from the                          
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the time                      
              evolution of molecular dissociation processes from                             
              electronically excited molecules. These measurements will allow                
              for an enhanced detailed understanding of how molecules                        
              decompose and form various sub-molecular moieties or of how                    
              chemical species react with other systems.                                     
                                                                                             
              The initial experiments use polarized emission spectroscopy,                   
              which measures the wavelength and polarization of the photons                  
              emitted during dissociation, to probe the change in the nuclear                
              dynamics induced by forces at a conical intersecton along the                  
              dissociative pathway. Professor Butler focuses on determining                  
              the change in the dissociation dynamics and the branching                      
              between energetically allowed fragmentation products induced by                
              1) the presence of a conical intersection along the                            
              dissociation pathway, 2) the excitation of a selected                          
              vibrationally activated molecule to the electronically                         
              dissociative state, allowing access to the excited potential                   
              surface beyond the Franck-Condon region, and 3) the change in                  
              the nonadiabatic coupling between two dissociative electronic                  
              states when a vibrationally excited molecule is promoted to the                
              dissociative surface.
