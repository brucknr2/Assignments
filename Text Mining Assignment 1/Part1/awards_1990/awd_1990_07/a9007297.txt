Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to support a symposium entitled "Amphibian                    
              Metamorphosis" to be held at the Annual Meeting of the American                
              Society of Zoologists in San Antonio on December 27-30, 1990. A                
              multidisciplinary approach to this subject is planned in order to              
              reexamine different aspects of amphibian metamorphosis, and the                
              focus will be on studies with anurans (frogs). A long time has                 
              passed since the last meeting dealing exclusively with this                    
              topic, and many advances, especially in molecular biology and                  
              immunology, have come about since then. The first meeting                      
              dedicated exclusively to amphibian metamorphosis was held in 1970              
              sponsored by Florida State University. In 1983 The British                     
              Society for Developmental Biology sponsored a symposium on both                
              amphibian and insect metamorphosis. These were to only                         
              comprehensive meetings concerning amphibian metamorphosis that                 
              have been convened. Modern scientists using divergent techniques               
              to study a  fundamental problem as metamorphosis do not interact               
              very often. The hope is to use this symposium to bring together                
              these biologists who study many different physiological systems                
              and who employ diverse techniques, to allow each scientist to                  
              develop fresh approaches to his system, and to determine whether               
              (or how) the different systems interact. The symposium will last               
              for one and one half days, and will consist of three major areas:              
              1) Functional MOrphology, 2) Physiology, and 3) Cell and                       
              Molecular Biology. The major objectives are to determine the                   
              directions in which the study of metamorphosis should proceed at               
              this time, and to encourage collaborations between scientists                  
              working in different disciplines. Because of the relative lack of              
              contributions concerning the role of the immune system at                      
              metamorphosis in previous meetings, there will be an emphasis on               
              immunology in the present symposium.
