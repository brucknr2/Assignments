Abstract    :
              Long & Medium-Term Research: X-Ray Crystallography Studies of                  
              Phycobiliproteins.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long                   
              & Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                  
              program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                       
              conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                  
              proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                       
              conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or compli-                    
              mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                   
              foreign countries.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This award will support a twelve-month visit by Dr. Michael                    
              Becker of the University of Washington to work with Prof. Dr.                  
              Robert Huber of the Max-Planck-Institut fr Biochemie in                       
              Martinsried bei Mnchen, Germany, on "X-Ray Crystallography                    
              Studies of Phycobiliproteins."  Phycobiliproteins of the                       
              cryptomonad algae have highly unusual spectral and morpho-                     
              logical characteristics.  The principal investigator proposes                  
              to determine the structure of one of these proteins by X-Ray                   
              diffraction techniques.  In order to find a phycobiliprotein                   
              suitable for X-Ray diffraction studies, the investigators                      
              will first isolate, partially characterize, and attempt to                     
              crystallize phycobiliproteins from several different species                   
              of the cryptomonad algae.  Structural studies on these                         
              proteins could yield exciting information in at least two                      
              different areas of biochemistry:  photosynthetic energy                        
              transfer, and protein folding and aggregation.
