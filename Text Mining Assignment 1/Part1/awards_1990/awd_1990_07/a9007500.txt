Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Robbins will attempt to use a novel technique to ablate                    
              single protein species from living tissue.  This method will                   
              allow the molecular analysis of cell-cell interactions during                  
              development.  The technique is based on the observation that the               
              dye malachite green, when irraditated with a laser beam, destroys              
              proteins within a very small radius of the dye molecule (on the                
              order of the diameter of one protein molecule).  Dr. Robbins will              
              conjugate malachite green to ligands for the acetylcholine                     
              receptor, incubate exposed, living neuromuscular junctions to the              
              conjugated dye, and irradiate small areas of the tissue with a                 
              laser.  He will then use morphological techniques on the light                 
              and electron microscopic levels to determine whether                           
              acetylcholine receptors were specifically destroyed, leaving the               
              neighboring molecules intact.  A further aim of the study is to                
              determine whether nerve terminals can be selectively destroyed                 
              using this technique in combination with ligands that bind                     
              selectively to nerve terminal surfaces.  Destruction of nerve                  
              terminals and preservation of surrounding components of the                    
              neuromuscular junction will be assayed using electrophysiological              
              and morphological techniques.
