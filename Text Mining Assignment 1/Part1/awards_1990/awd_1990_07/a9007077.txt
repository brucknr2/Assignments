Abstract    :
              A flashlamp pumped tunable dye laser and a laser wavelength                    
              meter will be used to conduct Raman, Rayleigh and Fluorescence                 
              scattering experiments in a wide range of combustion research                  
              projects which are currently underway, or that are under                       
              construction.  These include:  departure from chemical                         
              equilibrium in subsonic and supersonic turbulent reacting                      
              flows; boundary layer stationary and propagating turbulent                     
              flames; and reciprocating engine combustion.  These research                   
              projects are aimed at providing understanding of combustion                    
              processes related to fossil fuel energy conversion, air                        
              pollution, propulsion, and fire safety.  All these projects                    
              share the need of an optical diagnostics system capable of                     
              providing information about the density, temperature and major                 
              species concentrations in the reaction zone, as well as flow                   
              velocity.  It is anticipated that the tunable dye laser and                    
              the laser wavelength meter will provide valuable data for the                  
              analysis of these combustion problems.
