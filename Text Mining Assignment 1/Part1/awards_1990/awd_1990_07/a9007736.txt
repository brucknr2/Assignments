Abstract    :
                   "Strings '90," a conference dealing with various aspects                  
              of the superstring theory of elementary particle physics, was                  
              held March 12-17, 1990 at Texas A&M University.  The conference                
              brought together many leading experts, both junior and senior,                 
              in superstring theory to discuss recent developments and future                
              directions.  While superstring theory is potentially the answer                
              to the very fundamental question of how one may describe and                   
              unify all of the fundamental forces, including gravity, itis                   
              also dauntingly difficult, and interactions which can take                     
              place at conferences such as this one are very important to                    
              progress in the field.  Also important is the publication of a                 
              proceedings which will make the developments reported at the                   
              conference accessible to the many unable to attend.  The                       
              creation of the proceedings is the project supported by the                    
              present award.
