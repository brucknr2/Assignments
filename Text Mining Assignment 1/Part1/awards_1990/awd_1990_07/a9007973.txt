Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Philip Kohl, in a collaborative project with Russian                       
              archaeological colleagues, will lay the groundwork for a long-                 
              term archaeological research project in the Transcaucasia region               
              of Southern Russia.  The team will examine what are essentially                
              uninvestigated remains which include large fortified Bronze and                
              Iron Age hilltop sites and burial mounds.  Archaeological                      
              deposits from earlier Mesolithic and Neolithic periods will also               
              be examined.  Sites will be mapped using aerial techniques and                 
              surface materials collected.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This research is important for several reasons.  First, although               
              the Transcaucasia area is known to be rich in archeological                    
              remains, very little systematic work has been conducted.  This                 
              project will help to fill that gap.  Secondly, because of its                  
              richness in raw materials such as obsidian (volcanic glass) and                
              metals which were widely valued in prehistory, this area probably              
              played a major role in the development of complex Old World                    
              societies, and research here will shed additional light on                     
              prehistoric development over a broad geographic area.  Finally,                
              Dr. Kohl's work should help to solidify ties between U.S. and                  
              Russian archaeologists and open the way for future collaborative               
              research.
