Abstract    :
              Matching funds are provided for the purchase of an X-ray                       
              residual stress measuring device.  The equipment will be                       
              used to determine residual stresses in ground surfaces of                      
              metallic and ceramic materials.  The stress measurements                       
              will be correlated with processing parameters and with                         
              performance in mechanical property tests.  Techniques will                     
              be developed to pre-determine the residual stresses in                         
              ground ceramics.
