Abstract    :
                   The South Turkana Ecosystem Project (STEP) is a long-term,                
              interdisciplinary ecosystem-oriented study of Ngisonyoka Turkana               
              pastoral nomads and their interactions with a dry                              
              savanna/woodland ecosystem in Northern Kenya.  The initial                     
              objective of STEP in the early 1980s was to determine how                      
              Ngisonyoka pastoralists, with only their traditional technology,               
              managed to survive and persist in a dry and drought-stressed                   
              ecosystem, in the midst of rampant banditry and inter-tribal                   
              warfare.  Over the last ten years the project has conducted a                  
              number of studies on landscapes, vegetation, livestock, and                    
              people.  The project team will now perform research-synthesis                  
              phase of two years duration for the purpose of pulling together                
              and synthesizing the results of the diverse disciplinary studies               
              around ecosystem level concepts or particular issues that have                 
              arisen during the course of the work.  By integrating the results              
              of field and modeling work around important issues and concepts                
              it is expected that the group will (1) demonstrate that studies                
              of human ecology, biology and society can be integrated into                   
              ecosystem science; (2) show that it is feasible to incorporate                 
              climate studies, ecosystem analyses, and social science within a               
              single investigatory and modeling framework; (3) provide several               
              new insights into the structure and dynamics of dry tropical                   
              ecosystems and, most importantly; (4) present a holistic portrait              
              of the ecology of pastoral nomads, their biological, social, and               
              resource exploitation strategies, and their interactions with                  
              their ecosystem.
