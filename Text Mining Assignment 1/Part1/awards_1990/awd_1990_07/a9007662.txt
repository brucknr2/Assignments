Abstract    :
                   Studies in the Turkana Basin of northern Kenya are currently              
              yielding important evidence of the development of early humans in              
              East Africa.  Few localities are as ideally suited to answer some              
              of the major questions being asked in paleoanthropology today.                 
              This is largely due to the extent of our knowledge of the                      
              detailed stratigraphic relations, chronology and environmental                 
              significance of the deposits which enclose the fossils and                     
              artifacts there.  Expanding the geographic range of that                       
              knowledge to peripheral areas of the basin holds considerable                  
              promise, as recently discovered deposits there represent habits                
              thus far poorly known.  This proposal is for continued study of                
              the tephrostratigraphy of the Turkana Basin sequence and of other              
              distal deposits (including the Awash Valley, Baringo Basin and                 
              Lake Albert Rift) erupted from the same sources in order to allow              
              temporal integration of these widespread localities.  In                       
              addition, continued study of the detailed stratigraphy and                     
              paleoenvironmental context of the Turkana Basin deposits will                  
              further refine our understanding of the context from which one of              
              the richest record of early humans has been recovered.
