Abstract    :
              The Organic Dynamics Program will support Professor Michael De                 
              Rosa's investigation of the "Studies on the Mechanism of                       
              Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution" in the Chemistry                          
              Department at Pennsylvania State University, Delaware County.                  
              He and undergraduate research students will develop new                        
              methodology that will unambiguously demonstrate how many                       
              intermediates are present in electrophilic substitution                        
              reactions.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The kinetics and products of the dichloroethanoic acid                         
              catalyzed chlorination of pyrroles with N-chlorobenzamides and                 
              the carboxylic acid catalyzed chlorination of methoxybenzenes                  
              with N-chloroacetanilides are being studied.  The                              
              intramolecular selectivity and intramolecular selectivity will                 
              be determined in order to elucidate the role of pi complexes in                
              the electrophilic substitution mechanism.
