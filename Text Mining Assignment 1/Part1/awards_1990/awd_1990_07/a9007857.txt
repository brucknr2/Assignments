Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in automorphic forms and                 
              representations of Professor Goro Shimura of Princeton                         
              University. Dr. Shimura's work will be concerned principally with              
              the topics of: the periods of automorphic forms of arithmetic                  
              type; differential operators on symmetric spaces; and the special              
              values of various zeta functions and Eisenstein series.                        
                   Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                
              century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                    
              century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                      
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                 
              rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                   
              study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.              
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                     
              retains connection to its historical roots.
