Abstract    :
                   Professor Szarek will study the isomorphic theory of Banach               
              spaces, some problems from finite dimensional operator theory,                 
              and scientific computation linked to these areas.  One of the                  
              problems to be investigated is whether extremely rigid infinite                
              dimensional Banach spaces exist where for example the Calkin                   
              algebra is abelian or consists only of multiples of the identity               
              operator.                                                                      
                   This award will support research in the geometry of Banach                
              spaces.  In finite dimensions, all vector spaces are essentially               
              the same.  But in the infinite dimensional situation of interest               
              here, this is far from the case.  Banach spaces are infinite                   
              dimensional spaces with the additional structure introduced by                 
              varying notions of distance between points in the space.  Such                 
              spaces have wide application in mathematics, both pure and                     
              applied.
