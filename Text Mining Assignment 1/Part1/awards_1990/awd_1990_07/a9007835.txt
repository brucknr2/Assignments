Abstract    :
                   The unique preservation and abundance of Ediacaran-type                   
              fossils in the Upper Precambrian at Mistaken Point, southeast                  
              Newfoundland, provide an ideal test of the hypothesis that the                 
              soft-bodied Vendozoa represent a non-metazoan branch of early                  
              evolution.  Of particular interest is the unusual "spindle-shaped              
              fossils" at this locality.  The availability of literally                      
              hundreds of fossil impressions will allow a complete study of the              
              anatomy, life history and morphogenesis of this organism in                    
              terms of constructional morphology.  A key aspect of our project               
              is the integratation of methods from paleoichnology, structural                
              geology, sedimentary geochemistry, sedimentology and                           
              micropaleontology to restore and analyze the paleobiology and                  
              benthic environment of this Vendozoan fauna.  Silicon casts will               
              allow us to develop representative museum collections at Yale and              
              Tubingen universities, thus preserving the important                           
              paleontological value of the Mistaken Point locality.
