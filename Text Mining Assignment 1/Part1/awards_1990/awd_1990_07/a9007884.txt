Abstract    :
                   Theoretical understanding of photon and electron collision                
              processes with atoms and ions is important to a broad range of                 
              scientific activities.  The Multi-Configuration Hartree-Fock                   
              technique has been developed to provide an economical treatment                
              of polarization and electron correlation for such processes.                   
              It will be extended to more than one open channel and applied                  
              to the calculation of valence and K shell photoionization, low                 
              energy electron scattering, photodetachment of negative ions                   
              and photoionization of excited states.  Relativistic effects                   
              will be included using a Breit-Pauli treatment and some attempt                
              will be made to look at collisions in a laser field.
