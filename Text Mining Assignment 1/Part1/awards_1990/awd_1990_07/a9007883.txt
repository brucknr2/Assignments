Abstract    :
                   The research focuses on the problem of electron                           
              correlations in scattering and photoionization of complex                      
              atoms.  Methods will be developed for accurate calculations on                 
              systems requiring the inclusion of relativistic effects such as                
              tungsten and platinum.  Resonance and multiplet effects will                   
              be treated.  Studies of processes involving simultaneous                       
              ionization and excitation in Li, Be and Na will be undertaken                  
              using both MBPT and the R-matrix method.  Impact ionization                    
              involving double and triple ejection will also be treated.                     
              Finally, coupled cluster approaches using discrete basis sets                  
              will be used to calculate energy levels, oscillator strengths                  
              and polarizabilities  in the rare gases and for accurate                       
              calculation of parity nonconserving transitions in Rb, Cs, Tl                  
              and Pb.
