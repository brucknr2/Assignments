Abstract    :
                   The East African Rift Valley Lakes are remarkable for the                 
              large number of unique cichlid fish species which they contain.                
              Lake Malawi, with over 250 species of endemic cichlids, has more               
              species of fish than any other lake in the world.  To better                   
              understand the evolutionary mechanisms which produced these many               
              species, portions of the mitochondrial DNA of these fish will be               
              sequenced.  The sequences will then be used to reconstruct the                 
              evolutionary relationships among the cichlid fish in Lakes                     
              Malawi, Tanganyika and Victoria.  These studies will have an                   
              important impact on ecological and evolutionary studies of these               
              fish.  A clear phylogenetic hypothesis for the taxa will allow                 
              inference of the morphological, ecological and behavioral                      
              characteristics of ancestral species, which is important to our                
              understanding of how these species flocks arose.
