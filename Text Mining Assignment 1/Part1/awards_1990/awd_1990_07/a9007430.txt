Abstract    :
              Messenger RNA splicing is an essential step in eukaryotic gene                 
              expression and requires the action of the small nuclear                        
              ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs).  These particles consist                 
              of a small nuclear RNA molecule (snRNA) which is complexed with                
              up to ten proteins.  Although the U1-U6 snRNPs are known to be                 
              essential for splicing, the specific functions of these snRNAs                 
              and their associated proteins are poorly understood.  Our long                 
              term objective is to define the roles of the RNA and protein                   
              components of the snRNPs, and to discover how these molecules                  
              contribute to the consummate specificity of the splicing                       
              reaction.  The goal of this proposal is to identify the precise                
              function of a highly conserved snRNP protein called 70K, a                     
              component of the U1 snRNP.  The gene encoding the yeast 70K                    
              homolog will be cloned using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR).                
              The clones gene will be used to generate a set of conditional                  
              mutations in 70K.  These mutants will be tested for their                      
              effects on U1-specific processes including 5' splice site                      
              identification, 5' cleavage site determination, branch site                    
              recognition, interaction with the pre-messenger RNA as well as                 
              with other proteins involved in splicing.
