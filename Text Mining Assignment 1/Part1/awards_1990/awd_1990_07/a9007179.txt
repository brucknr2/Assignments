Abstract    :
              With this grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry                       
              Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Goodman will                      
              continue his benchmark work on elucidating the detailed motions                
              of the atoms in the benzene molecule, when this molecule is                    
              subjected to ultraviolet light.                                                
                                                                                             
              The thrust of this research is to generate accurate potential                  
              surfaces for the fundamental region of the ground and lowest                   
              excited singlet states of benzene.  These benzene experimental                 
              force fields will provide badly needed benchmarks for                          
              calibrating theoretical harmonic and anharmonic potential                      
              surface models for both closed shell ground and open shell                     
              excited states.  Two-laser experiments on isotopically labelled                
              benzene, combined with conventional jet experiments, should                    
              allow a complete harmonic force field to be constructed for the                
              benzene excited state.
