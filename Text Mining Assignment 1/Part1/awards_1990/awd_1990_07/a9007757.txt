Abstract    :
                   Professor Gilfeather will investigate cohomology in operator              
              algebras by extending natural topological constructions to a                   
              non-commutative setting.  The expectation is that his work will                
              lead to a better understanding of the cohomology of non-                       
              selfadjoint operator algebras and will therefore have a                        
              substantial impact on our understanding of these algebras.                     
                   This research originates in the study of operators on                     
              Hilbert space.  Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite               
              matrices of complex numbers.  These operators have applications                
              in every area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics.               
              This type of research is an attempt to classify certain important              
              categories of such objects.
