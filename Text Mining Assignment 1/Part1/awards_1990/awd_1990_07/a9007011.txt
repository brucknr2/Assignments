Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Rapid solidification of oxide ceramics is a novel                              
              processing technique which can yield materials with                            
              microstructures and properties which cannot be obtained by                     
              other processing techniques.  This proposal is for the                         
              purchase of an induction heating unit to heat oxides to                        
              their melting point and then rapidly solidify them.                            
              These materials have enormous potential for structural,                        
              magnetic, electrical, and superconducting applications as                      
              well as producing glasses of unique compositions.                              
                                                                                             
              Two classes of oxide systems, ZrO2 containing ceramics and                     
              MBa2Cu3O7-x (M=Y,Dy,Gd) superconductors will be melted by                      
              induction heating and rapidly solidified by twin roller                        
              quenching.  These materials will be examined by                                
              differential thermal analysis, scanning and transmission                       
              electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction.
