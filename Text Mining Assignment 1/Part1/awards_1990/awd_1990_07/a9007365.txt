Abstract    :
              This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research that will allow                 
              Dr.  Needleman to develop a much needed system for the expression              
              of cloned archaebacterial genes of Halobacterium.  The successful              
              development of this system would have profound effects on the                  
              study of halobacterial proteins like bactaeriorhodopsin and                    
              halorhodopsin and on the molecular biology of archaebacteria.
