Abstract    :
                   In this proposal the P.I. develops a mechanistic model of                 
              competition that makes predictions about how resource use by                   
              plants influences both individual competitive ability and the                  
              population-level outcome of competition along productivity                     
              gradients.  The model is based on separating two components of                 
              competitive ability:  ability to deplete resources and ability to              
              tolerate depleted resources.  Using these two types of plant-                  
              resource interactions to predict the outcome of net plant-plant                
              interactions is complex because the relative sizes of interacting              
              plants determine whether good depletors or good tolerators are                 
              the superior competitors and because depletion and tolerance                   
              abilities are determined by different plant traits.  The                       
              investigators develops specific predictions about these                        
              relationships and describe experiments to test them in a desert                
              grassland community such models should have significant                        
              implication for many plant communities, included those endangered              
              worldwide.
