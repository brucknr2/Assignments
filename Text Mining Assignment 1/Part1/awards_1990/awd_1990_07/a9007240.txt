Abstract    :
                   The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships               
              are awards to recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the                     
              mathematical sciences.  These awards are a means of contributing               
              to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation.                 
              As researchers in the mathematical sciences expand their                       
              interactions with other disciplines, and as the interplay                      
              increases between the various areas of mathematics itself,                     
              opportunities for postdoctoral research and training are becoming              
              increasingly important.  The fellowships are designed to permit                
              awardees to choose research environments that will have maximal                
              impact on their future scientific development.  The fellowship is              
              designed to provide 24 months of support divided into 18                       
              academic-year months and 3 periods of two summer months.  The                  
              recipient may choose (1) the Research Fellowship option which                  
              allows for full-time support for any 18 academic-year months in a              
              three-year period, in intervals not shorter than 3 consecutive                 
              months or (2) the Research Instructorship option which allows the              
              18 months of academic year support to be taken as 9 months of                  
              full-time support and 18 months of half-time support.  Not more                
              than two months of summer support from this Fellowship may be                  
              received in any calendar year.                                                 
                   Bonnie Berger will receive her doctoral degree from the                   
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and will pursue research                
              in the area of the design and analysis of parallel algorithms for              
              problems in combinatorics, graph theory, computational geometry,               
              and optimization, under the guidance of Daniel Kleitman at the                 
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
