Abstract    :
              The research is on a methodology for efficiently analyzing high                
              performance MOS and bipolar circuits but with capabilities for                 
              predicting the analog behavior.  Prototype software is being developed         
              for analyzing logic path delays.  The algorithms are based in the              
              asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE) method which enables the analysis         
              of general RLC interconnect models.  The AWE capabilities are being used       
              to develop a waveform analyzer for high speed bipolar and MOS logic gate       
              and interconnect models.  Specific topics being investigated are a.            
              evaluating the logic stage waveforms, b. developing gate delay models          
              for both technologies, c. modeling the coupling between logic states,          
              d. statistical waveform analysis, and e. analyzing deformed logic stage        
              models.
