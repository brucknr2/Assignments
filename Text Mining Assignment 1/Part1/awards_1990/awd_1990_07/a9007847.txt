Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the travel for a University of South                  
              Carolina faculty member, and provides for the travel and                       
              stipends for two of his graduate students.  They will attempt                  
              to measure the half-life and spectral shape of the 2v BB decay                 
              of 76Ge, and improve searches for weakly interacting massive                   
              particles using ultra-low background Ge detectors.
