Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In some animals regeneration of sensory or neural tissue can                   
              occur after damage.  The implications are tremendous of                        
              understanding such repair mechanisms, to extend the knowledge to               
              mammalian and human systems.  The auditory organ of the inner ear              
              is the cochlea in mammals, and in birds the comparable organ is                
              also called the cochlea.  Recent anatomical studies show that the              
              receptor cells of the bird cochlea can regenerate after damage                 
              caused by intense noise or by certain drugs, and may establish                 
              connections with auditory nerve fibers.  This study uses the                   
              powerful approach of electrophysiological recording from single                
              auditory fibers, to compare the activity in normal ears with the               
              activity in ears having regenerated tissue, to answer the                      
              fundamental question of whether functional recovery accompanies                
              the anatomical regeneration.  Results from this unique and needed              
              work will have impact on sensory neuroscience, developmental                   
              neurobiology, and on biomedical engineering.
