Abstract    :
              Dr. Wagner plans to develop and improve NMR methods to                         
              characterize protein structures at the highest accuracy and                    
              focus on aspects of protein structure where NMR can provide                    
              information complementary to x-ray crystal structure analysis.                 
              In particular, he hopes to develop methods to characterize                     
              better the surface conformations of proteins, since these are                  
              relevant for many aspects of protein functions such as protein                 
              target recognition.  He hopes to work out better procedures to                 
              judge the quality of NMR structures.  He will determine, as far                
              as possible, how the parameters of mobility obtained through                   
              his studies can be associated with specific components of the                  
              protein, and try to obtain as complete a description of static                 
              and dynamic characteristics of the protein as possible.
