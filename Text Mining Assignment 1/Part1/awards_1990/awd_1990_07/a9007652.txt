Abstract    :
                   Dr. Joel Cracraft and Kathleen Helm-Bychowski, at the                     
              University of Illinois, Chicago are studying the evolutionary                  
              relationships of the Australasian birds-of-paradise                            
              (Paradisaeidae) to other families of Australasian songbirds.                   
              Phylogenetic relationships are assessed by comparisons of                      
              mitochondrial DNA sequences between species. The phylogeny is                  
              determined by computer analysis, and will be compared with a                   
              phylogeny based on anatomical data. The study will provide                     
              important evidence about the origin and evolutionary history of                
              the birds-of-paradise, and help us to understand the                           
              diversification of the Australasian birds. The phylogenetic study              
              will also help us understand the structure and function of the                 
              mitochondrial genes and how they are modified by evolution.
