Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this proposal novel in situ infrared analysis system is                     
              sought.  This system will be used by a group of five                           
              investigators and their students in order to investigate a                     
              number of research projects in the general area of processing                  
              of advanced materials.  Several projects in the field of                       
              reaction and transport processes will benefit from the                         
              availability of this system.  The kinetics of gel formation                    
              before and after the gelation point will be studied with FTIR                  
              using the reaction of multimethacrylates as a model example.                   
              The kinetics and structure of ceramic gels will be studied                     
              similarly.  The fundamental properties of GaAs surfaces and                    
              Langmuir-Blodgett films will be investigated.  Microelectronic                 
              processing will be studied and the distribution of moisture                    
              concentration in epoxy networks will be investigated.                          
              Finally, protein adsorption on polymeric biomaterial will be                   
              studied using ATR-FTIR.
