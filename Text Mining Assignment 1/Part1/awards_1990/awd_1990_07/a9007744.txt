Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for a workshop on                          
              nitrate contamination of groundwater, exposure,                                
              consequences and control.  The workshop will be held at                        
              the University of Nebraska, Lincoln from September 10-14,                      
              1990 and is being principally supported by the NATO                            
              Scientific Affairs Division.  This award from NSF will                         
              permit extending support for participation in this                             
              conference by Dr. Jaroslav Vrba, Chairman of the                               
              Commission for Groundwater Protections of the                                  
              International Association of Hydrogeologists                                   
              (Czechoslovakia) who will speak on Hydrogeological System                      
              Nitrate Contamination - Origin and Control in Eastern                          
              European Countries, or by an alternative person on a                           
              similar topic.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Results of this workshop are expected to provide guidance                      
              to the program in its support of research on groundwater                       
              pollution from substances that contribute nitrogenous                          
              substances to groundwater aquifers.
