Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research is designed to foster our understanding of the              
              relationship between diversification of a complex                              
              structure/function system and the evolution of a lineage.  The                 
              project entails a detailed morphological and phylogenetic                      
              analysis of the feeding apparatus of frogs, focusing on a set of               
              species chosen to represent the major functional transformations               
              that have occurred in the anuran feeding system during                         
              phylogenesis.  The morphology of the musculoskeletal system,                   
              peripheral innervation, and associated motor nuclei of the                     
              hyolingual apparatus will be used to derive characters for                     
              analysis of anuran relationships and to test general and specific              
              hypotheses of structural transformation.  This project will                    
              contribute (1) important baseline data for biomechanical and                   
              functional analyses of feeding systems, (2) an increase in the                 
              resolution of the phylogenetic relationships of the major                      
              lineages of anurans, and (3) a general understanding of the                    
              relationship between diversification of a complex functional                   
              system and the evolution of a lineage.
