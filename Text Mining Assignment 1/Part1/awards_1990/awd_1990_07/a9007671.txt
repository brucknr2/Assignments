Abstract    :
                      Gracillariids are a family of minute colorful moths                    
              comprising more than 1500 species world.wide.  In their early                  
              developmental stages they live as "leaf miners" on woody plants,               
              and they constitute an economic pest in some areas.  Unlike most               
              animals, the early stages of gracillariid development are more                 
              diversified and structurally complex (especially for sap.feeding               
              forms) than the later stages, which converge on the generalized                
              morphology of a moth.  Dr. David Wagner proposes a taxonomic                   
              revision of the North American species of the family.  Geographic              
              ranges, life histories, host associations, and morphological data              
              from reared specimens will be synthesized.  These data will also               
              be used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among North              
              American species.                                                              
                      The proposed research has implications beyond gracillariid             
              specialists.  The proposed revision will facilitate ecological                 
              research and will help attempts to control this economically                   
              important pest.  The resulting genealogical framework will allow               
              future studies to explore the evolution of different life                      
              histories and developmental pathways.  This group and this                     
              research project will attract the attention of developmental                   
              biologists, ecologists, systematists, functional morphologists,                
              and evolutionary biologists in general.
