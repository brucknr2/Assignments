Abstract    :
              This research is on a unified way to consider both timing and                  
              geometric constraints during the placement process.  The approach              
              is to convert timing constraints to geometric shapes using "defined            
              windows".  A window represents a region in which all the modules               
              along a given path can be placed without degrading the circuit                 
              performance.  Then, based on the window information, a constructive            
              placement process is used to select an unplaced module and to find             
              an appropriate position for the module.  Algorithms for the                    
              following issues are being studied: path elimination, window and               
              region construction, module selection, module placement and path               
              breaking, and slack distribution.
