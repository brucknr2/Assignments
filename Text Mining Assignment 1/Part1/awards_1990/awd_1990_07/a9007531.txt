Abstract    :
                   Land plants are diverse and abundant components of the                    
              Devonian fossil record, but they are barely represented in                     
              Silurian rocks.  As a result, the emergence of plants onto dry                 
              land is poorly understood.  Spores and fragmentary macrofossils                
              have been recovered from Silurian rocks in the Welsh Borderlands               
              and the northern Appalachians, but critical comparisons between                
              these unique paleofloras have not yet been attempted.  Dr. Paul                
              Strother proposes an intensive collecting effort in Pennsylvania,              
              followed by comparative analysis with Welsh material.  Dr.                     
              Strother will use infrared imaging to isolate and analyze the                  
              cuticular plant remains that have been preserved in shales.                    
                   The proposed research has the potential to contribute                     
              important new fossils to our meager understanding of early land                
              plants.  Dr. Strother's explorations and analysis will clarify                 
              the anatomy and ecology of these first land plants, and will help              
              to illuminate their evolutionary relationships to younger fossil               
              groups and to extant plants.  His results will find a wide                     
              audience among botanists, paleoecologists, and evolutionary                    
              biologists in general.
