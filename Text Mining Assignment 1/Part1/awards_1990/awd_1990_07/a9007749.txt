Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) Spectroscopy is the primary                      
              technique to study single electron transfer events between a                   
              particiular absorbase and a donor.  The ESR is useful in areas                 
              such as solid state chemistry, surface chemistry, solid state                  
              physics, electrochemistry, and material science.                               
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                   
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Washington State                      
              University acquire an Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)                            
              Spectrometer.  The ESR will be used in the following research                  
              topics:                                                                        
                                                                                             
              1.  Electron Spin Resonance Investigation of Pure and                          
                  Intercalated M2P2X6 Lattices                                               
                                                                                             
              2.  Redox Chemistry on Metal Oxides                                            
                                                                                             
              3.  The Design and Characterization of Low Dimensional Magnetic                
                  Materials and the Study of Structural Phase Transitions
