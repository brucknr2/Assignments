Abstract    :
              The project has three parts:                                                    
                                                                                            
              Efficient algorithms for random sampling from convex sets in Euclidean         
              space using the theory of rapidly mixing Markov chains and the                 
              applications of such algorithms.                                               
                                                                                             
              Lattice relaxations of Integer Programming problems that produce               
              better bounding procedures and related lattice questions.                      
                                                                                             
              Strongly polynomial time algorithms for the greatest common divisor            
              and genealizations.
