Abstract    :
                   Research at the highly mathematical end of theoretical                    
              elementary particle physics will focus on string theory,                       
              conformal quantum field theories, integrable systems, quantum                  
              symmetries, and related topics.  String theory is a promising                  
              framework for the consistent unified description of all                        
              particles and forces, including gravity.  Conformal field                      
              theories provide the ground (i.e., "normal") states of the                     
              world for string theory.  String theory raises numerous highly                 
              mathematical issues, and studies of the type to be undertaken                  
              here will aid in addressing them, and thus facilitate the                      
              progress of the field.
