Abstract    :
                   Natural hydrocarbon emissions from plants, estimated to be                
              830 Tg per year globally, play an important role in the                        
              generation of tropospheric ozone, regulation of daytime OH                     
              concentration, and are precursors of CO.  However, there are many              
              uncertainties in regional and global inventories of these                      
              biogenic compounds.  Much of the uncertainty arises because there              
              is a lack of precise data relating hydrocarbon emissions to key                
              environmental variables that regulate such emissions from                      
              vegetation.  This is especially true for emissions of isoprene                 
              (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene), the single most abundant hydrocarbon                 
              emitted from plants.  Many questions can be posed concerning NMHC              
              emissions, 1. What major NMHC are emitted from plants?  2. What                
              environmental variables control NMHC emissions?  3. Do                         
              environmental stresses increase or decrease NMHC emissions?  4.                
              What are the biochemical pathways for biosynthesis of NMHC and                 
              where is synthesis located in plant cells?  5. Can we develop a                
              mechanism based model to explain NMHC emissions from plants?  6.               
              Why do plants emit NMHC such as isoprene?  The major goal of this              
              work is to attempt to answer these questions in the case of                    
              isoprene emission from plants.  Second, the project addresses a                
              subset of these question in plants that emit a mixture of NMHC,                
              focusing on the simultaneous measurement of isoprene and                       
              monoterpene emissions from the same leaves.  This will provide                 
              new details for the environmental control for monoterpene                      
              emissions. Third, while the above experiments are conducted there              
              will be simultaneous monitoring of emissions of oxygenated                     
              hydrocarbons (oxHC),  such as acetone, methanol, ethanol and                   
              acetaldehyde.  This will provide a framework for understanding                 
              the physiological and environmental conditions that lead to the                
              emission of oxHC from plants.
