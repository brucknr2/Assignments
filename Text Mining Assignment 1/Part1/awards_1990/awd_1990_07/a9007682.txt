Abstract    :
                   This conference will encompass a wide range of topics                     
              relating to the behavior of atoms and molecules in optical                     
              (laser) fields intense enough so that the normal absorption                    
              processes involve more than one photon, and a variety of new                   
              phenomena arise.  Emphasis will be given to important new                      
              developments.  NSF funding will be used to ensure the                          
              participation of younger contributing scientists, some senior                  
              graduate students and postdoctoral research associates and key                 
              senior scientist without alternative travel resources.
