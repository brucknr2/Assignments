Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Materials Chemistry and Chemical                     
              Processing Initiative in support of the collaborative research                 
              of Professors Cowley, Jones, Ekerdt and White at the University                
              of Texas/Austin. Joint funding is provided by the Divisions of                 
              Chemistry, Materials Research, and Chemical and Thermal                        
              Systems. The principal objective is to achieve precise control                 
              of the physical and electronic properties of epitaxially grown                 
              semiconductor thin films through the rational design and                       
              chemical synthesis of single-source precursors.                                
                                                                                             
              Novel single-source precursors will be prepared and their                      
              structures and stabilities determined. Thin films will be grown                
              by chemical beam epitaxy and the adsorption, decomposition and                 
              surface desorption kinetics of the precursors will be studied                  
              by advanced surface science techniques. The relationship                       
              between precursor structure, surface reactions and materials                   
              properties will be explored in order to develop an atomistic                   
              description of how the precursors react at the interface and                   
              how film growth progresses.
