Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement                  
              Award.  The research is aimed at understanding the effects of                  
              photon irradiation on the growth of wide-gap zinc selenide                     
              compound semiconductors using chemical beam epitaxy techniques to              
              grow the specimens.  The research is being done in collaboration               
              with Professor ÕLeslie Koldziejski at the Facility for epitaxial               
              Growth of Compound Semiconductors at the Massachusetts Institute               
              of Technology.  The various photolytic, electronic, and pyrolytic              
              processes associated with the photo-assisted chemical beam                     
              epitaxial process are being studied.
