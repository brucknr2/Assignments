Abstract    :
                   This work will study the dynamics of interpenetrating                     
              fluids including the development of instabilities in fluidized                 
              beds and radiative transport in hot, rapidly rotating stars.                   
              Other topics include solitary structures resulting from the                    
              complex Ginzburg - Landau equation, thermonuclear convection in                
              stellar cores and temporal chaos.
