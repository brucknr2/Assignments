Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with describing the movement of                
              discrete units in stochastic networks.  There is a small class of              
              queueing networks which can presently be solved analytically.                  
              These are Markovian and have product form solutions.  Extension                
              to this class will be made by considering "partially balanced"                 
              networks, which allow for dependencies among nodes and routes (so              
              called intelligent networks).                                                  
                   The results of this research will be very important both for              
              the theory and the applications of queueing networks.
