Abstract    :
                    Management of the design of a large mechanical system such               
              as a passenger vehicle is a complex task involving hundreds of                 
              resources and thousands of design activities.  The objective of                
              this project is to develop a methodology for decomposition of the              
              design system, collection of technical data at the design activity             
              level, and planning of the design process for enhanced concurrency.            
              The project also includes the formulation of a multicriteria                   
              optimization model and solution algorithms for scheduling of design            
              activities.  This research should yield useful knowledge resulting             
              in infrared methods, traits and practice in the mechanical and                 
              structural design of passenger vehicles.
