Abstract    :
              It is proposed to construct a Structures Testing Strong Floor in               
              the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of                       
              Connecticut.  The Strong Floor would be 40 ft. wide by 68 ft.                  
              long, have a 4 ft. x 4 grid of anchors, each with a safe working               
              load of 100,000 lbs, be instrumented for overload protection, have             
              20 ft. headroom and be serviced by a 25 ton capacity overhead                  
              crane.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Regional cooperative research would be developed with other                    
              universities, research institutions and industry and so the                    
              Strong Floor would be a regional focus for structures testing.  The            
              Strong Floor would allow customized testing of unusual assemblies              
              and serve the region to improve construction safety.
