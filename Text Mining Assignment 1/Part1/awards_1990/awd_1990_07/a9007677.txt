Abstract    :
              The work on the Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA) makes it                 
              possible to store and route information in distributed and parallel            
              systems so as to achieve highly fault tolerant and space-time                  
              efficient performance.  Applications of this method will be developed,         
              in particular to routing in asynchronous parallel computers and to             
              storage of information in disk arrays.                                         
                                                                                             
              There now exist, non-cryptographic, secure (i.e. secret and resistant          
              to malicious adversaries) distributed computing protocols.  These              
              methods will be applied to extend the ITOSS (Integrated Toolkit for            
              Operating System Security) to the distributed system environment so as         
              to achieve system security based on distributed authority.  IDA brings         
              about an improvement in routing of data through computation on that            
              data.  This suggests a study of the possible tradeoffs between                 
              computation and switching of data.                                             
                                                                                             
              Randomized algorithms will continue to be a major tool in the study of         
              the above questions.
