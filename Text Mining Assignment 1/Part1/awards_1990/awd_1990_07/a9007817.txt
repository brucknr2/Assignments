Abstract    :
              This research is to use connectionist networks to provide high                 
              accuracy, speaker- or accent-independent speech recognition.                   
              Recurrent connectionist networks and meta-pi networks, an                      
              architecture that uses multiplicative gating connections, provide              
              the framework.  Subnetworks provide speaker-specific models.                   
              Automatic methods to learn and maintain large speaker sensitive                
              nets will also be studied.  These networks will provide slower                 
              adaptation and will aid in automatic initiation of new units or                
              subnetworks as they are incorporated.  The techniques will allow               
              for dialect and accent adaptation as well as speaker                           
              identification.
