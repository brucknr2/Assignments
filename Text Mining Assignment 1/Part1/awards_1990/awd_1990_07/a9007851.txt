Abstract    :
              Research in science is shifting from its traditional focus on the              
              discovery of new information toward the computationally intensive task         
              of processing it.  This proposal aims at developing new algorithmic            
              techniques to support the large-scale computing requirements of high-          
              performance applications.  This project will focus on incremental,             
              parallel, and input/output (I/O) algorithms.                                   
              For each of these three computational models, several problems will            
              be studied, with particular emphasis on data structures, graphs, and           
              computational geometry.  These problems include such key                       
              high-performance applications as sorting, FFT, matrix operations,              
              neural nets, caching, VLSI layout, robotics, network optimization,             
              computer-aided design, and graphics display.  All three computational          
              models are motivated by the extreme demands placed by  large-scale             
              applications, and thus it makes sense to consider hybrid                       
              computational models in order to get even better performance.                  
              Examples include solving dynamic problems in parallel and analyzing            
              the I/O efficiency of parallel and incremental algorithms.  Finally, a         
              new framework for incremental complexity and its relation to                   
              sequential and parallel complexity will be studied.
