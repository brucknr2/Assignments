Abstract    :
                   This investigation will continue the study of cellular                    
              control systems and delay differential equations.  There are                   
              three main areas of study.  The first area is an                               
              interdisciplinary study done in collaboration with Dr. J. W.                   
              Zyskind on the modeling of initiation of replication in                        
              Escherichia coli, Mathematical models are developed to aid in our              
              understanding of experimental observations on initiation of DNA                
              replication.  The second  project uses analytical and numerical                
              methods to study the effects of size and compartmentalization on               
              the stability of cellular control models with diffusion and                    
              delays.  Dynamic growth models are developed and compared to                   
              experimental data.  The third area explores the stability of a                 
              linear differential equation with two delays using analytical and              
              numerical methods.  Bifurcation surfaces are found, and methods                
              are investigated to connect their geometries to analytical                     
              results.  The first two projects link mathematical studies to                  
              current biological problems.  All three problems require the                   
              development of new techniques of analysis that can be applied to               
              many modeling problems.
