Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with a variety of topics in                     
              algebraic geometry.  Research will be done on the construction                 
              and computation of Chow groups of moduli spaces and orbit spaces,              
              and related intersection theory; the problem of algebraic versus               
              homological equivalences of cycles; toric varieties; and branched              
              coverings.                                                                     
                   Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects                  
              arising from the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial                        
              equations.  This is one of the oldest and currently one of the                 
              most active branches of mathematics with widespread applications               
              in mathematics, computer science and physics.
