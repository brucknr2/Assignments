Abstract    :
                   Professor Teukolsky's group is investigating gravitational                
              collapse and the formation of black holes by solving Einstein's                
              equations for gravitation on a supercomputer.  They will                       
              determine how much gravitational radiation is emitted during                   
              such events.  They are also studying how neutron stars can                     
              explode while under the influence of another star in a binary                  
              system and are investigating the properties of rapidly rotating                
              stars.  Finally, they are trying to understand the observations                
              of the eclipsing pulsar with a theoretical model.
