Abstract    :
              This proposal is to partially fund a workshop on the localization              
              concept in material response as it applied to composites.  The idea            
              is very basic to the use of analytical models of material behavior.            
              In composites some aspects of the response are adequately modeled              
              as local behavior and others are not.
