Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an experimental study of the interaction of nutrient flux              
              and food web controls in regulating the productivity of lakes.                 
              Four lakes will be manipulated in a 2 X 2 design that tests the                
              capacity of alternative food web structures in response to                     
              increased nutrient loading.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The theoretical framework for this program is focused on                       
              stability and compensatory capacity of ecosystem processes. It is              
              based on scale-dependent perspectives that range from diel                     
              dynamics to paleolimnological calibration and from single species              
              to entire communities.  Models developed by the program will                   
              range from population dynamics of individual cohorts to                        
              integrated indicators of trophic level responses.  Results of                  
              this study will provide both conceptual and tactical advances in               
              furthering the use of food web management techniques as a means                
              for improving water quality.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This is an excellent research team that has been involved                      
              previously in trophic cascade research.  The facilities available              
              for this research are outstanding.
