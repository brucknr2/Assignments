Abstract    :
                   New workstations at the Institute for Advanced Study will                 
              facilitate more effective studies of solar neutrino production,                
              galaxy formation, quantum chromodynamics (the theory of the                    
              nuclear force), mathematical models of various physical and                    
              biological systems, and other topics.  The research program at                 
              the Institute is a broad and influential one which often                       
              requires significant amounts of numerical computation or                       
              graphical analysis.  The new equipment will make this                          
              computation and analysis more efficient and effective.
