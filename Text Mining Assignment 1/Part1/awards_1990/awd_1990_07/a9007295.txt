Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research is a study of the effects of developmental               
              regulation on the protein composition and chromatin structure of               
              specific eukaryotic genes.  A novel isolation technique,                       
              nucleoprotein hybridization, enables the enrichment and                        
              subsequent study of chromatin fragments of the developmentally-                
              regulated sea urchin early histone gene repeat (SUEHGR) from S.                
              purpuratus.  These five genes undergo a coordinated switch in                  
              expression during embryonic development.  The genes have been                  
              enriched to greater than 90% purity without noticeable nucleosome              
              loss or rearrangements, nor degradation of DNA or protein.                     
              Electron microscopy will determine the disposition of nucleosomes              
              and non-histone proteins along SUEHGR and the folding of the                   
              nucleosomes into 30 nm chromosome fibers.                                      
                                                                                             
              This will be the first direct study of the structure of a                      
              specific gene during embryonic development.  The results should                
              be a major contribution to our understanding of the mechanism of               
              eukaryotic gene regulation during embryogenesis.
