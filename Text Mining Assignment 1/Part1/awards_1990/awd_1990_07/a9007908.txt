Abstract    :
              The ASME's Bioprocess Engineering Program is presenting                        
              three advanced courses in Fall 1990 and up to five in 1992                     
              concerning the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals:                              
                                                                                             
              Bioreactor Kinetics                                                            
              Process Equipment Technology                                                   
              Process Equipment Design                                                       
                                                                                             
              at the University of Virginia during the weeks of 15                           
              October 1990 and March 1992.  The audience is process-                         
              development, manufacturing-facility and equipment                              
              engineers.  Fifty students are expected for each 3 day                         
              course.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Most of the US biotechnology industry is employing labor                       
              intensive and costly manufacturing methods.  The objective                     
              of the ASME's bioprocessing program is to help the                             
              industry develop continuous, instrumented and automated                        
              production methods which can make its therapeutic and                          
              veterinary proteins competitive in world markets.  There                       
              now is a severe shortage of properly trained engineers for                     
              commercial-production scale-up.  These courses will help                       
              relieve that shortage, but the universities must perform                       
              most of the education task.  These scholarships for ME                         
              faculty are requested so that they may attend the ASME                         
              courses for indoctrination in bioprocessing equipment                          
              technology and design.  Then they will be better prepared                      
              to initiate curricula at their institutions to produce                         
              qualified equipment engineers for the US biotechnology                         
              industry.
