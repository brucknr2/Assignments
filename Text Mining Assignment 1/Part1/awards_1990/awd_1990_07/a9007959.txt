Abstract    :
                   Shapiro plans to investigate questions in geometric group                 
              theory arising from the study of negatively curved, automatic,                 
              semi-hyperbolic and combable groups.  He plans to use concepts                 
              developed recently by him and others to examine 3-manifold groups              
              and an assortment of other groups which are geometric in                       
              character.  He would like to see if certain standard results for               
              co-compact groups of isometries of hyperbolic n-space can be                   
              extended to negatively curved groups, and would like to see in                 
              what ways the study of negatively curved groups can be used as a               
              guide to the study of groups which act co-compactly on spaces of               
              non-positive curvature.
