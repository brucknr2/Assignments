Abstract    :
                   Most plants compete for resources:  competition has been                  
              shown to limit growth in both agricultural and naturally-                      
              occurring plants. Many studies have investigated the importance                
              of competition (e.g. yield-density relationships, effects of                   
              weeds on crops).  However, very little is known about the                      
              evolutionary importance of competition.  To what degree has                    
              competition been important in the evolution of plant morphology,               
              physiology, and phenology?  There are four evolutionary                        
              alternatives or outcomes for competing plants:  resource                       
              partitioning, increased uptake of resources, increased efficiency              
              of resource use, and interference mechanisms.  The investigator                
              has predicted which alternative is most likely to occur in                     
              different types of competitive environments.                                   
                   The proposed research directly follows the evolution of                   
              plants in different competitive environments.  Brassica rapa L.                
              will be grown at high densities for ten discrete generations.                  
              Environments will differ in the presence and absence of                        
              interspecific competitors and fertilizer.  Each generation, the                
              largest 20% of the individuals  will be selected to be pollinated              
              and to provide seed for the next generation.  The investigator                 
              will monitor competitive characteristics of individuals of each                
              generation for changes in plant performance and traits.  The                   
              results will demonstrate which of the four evolutionary                        
              alternatives are most likely to occur in different conditions.
