Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Kit Bowen is supported by a grant from the Experimental                    
              Physical Chemistry Program to study photodissociation and                      
              photodetachment spectroscopy in size-selected gas-phase cluster                
              anions.  Chosen clusters are representative, on a microscopic                  
              scale, of real macroscopic solvent-solute systems.  These                      
              studies will provide a wealth of useful information regarding                  
              the chemical physics of the solvation process.                                 
                                                                                             
              Bowen plans to apply various spectroscopic tools including                     
              photoelectron, photodissociation and photodestruction                          
              spectroscopy to probe size-selected gas-phase cluster anions                   
              which include anion-neutral complexes, solvated electron-like                  
              cluster anions, and metal cluster anions.  The planned                         
              experiments will map the variation of sequential solvation                     
              energies and electron affinities as a function of cluster size                 
              as well as the evolution of anionic basicity with increasing                   
              degrees of solvation.  One emphasis of these studies will be to                
              compare various solvent systems, with water and ammonia cluster                
              anions receiving continued attention and with cluster anions of                
              alcohols, amines, ethers, and xenon being studied                              
              spectroscopically for the first time.
