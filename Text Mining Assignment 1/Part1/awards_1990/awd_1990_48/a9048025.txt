Abstract    :
                   The broad goal of this research is to identify design                     
              principles and methods that exploit both the form and functional               
              structure of devices.  Four approaches to design assistance based              
              on form-function relationships are being investigated.  Form-                  
              function characteristics of components are used to abstract high               
              level design relationships.  Secondly, device level form-function              
              relationships are derived from the aggregation of component level              
              behaviors in a way that considers the context and resolution of                
              the design stage.  Thirdly, device level characteristics are used              
              to determine dominant design relationships.  And fourthly, a                   
              synthesis strategy is based on the opportunistic utilization of                
              component functionality.  This program of research leads to the                
              observation that form-function characteristics of mechanical                   
              components and devices exists and can be identified from physical              
              principles.  Furthermore, design decisions are dominated by                    
              considerations having to do with form and function.  These                     
              observations have led to the development and implementation of                 
              specific design representations and strategies which are being                 
              evaluated for their utility in the preliminary design of simple                
              electro-mechanical devices.
