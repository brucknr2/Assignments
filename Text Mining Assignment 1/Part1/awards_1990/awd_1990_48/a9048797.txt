Abstract    :
                   This supplementary award funds Georgia Institute of                       
              Technology's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for               
              Material Handling to perform a collaborative research project with             
              Rutgers University's Industry/University Cooperative Research                  
              Center for Plastics Recycling.  This two-year project,                         
              "Optimization Study for Materials Recovery Facility Location and               
              Collection Routes for Recyclables", has been approved and                      
              recommended for cost sharing by both Center's Industry Advisory                
              Board.  The research will address materials recovery facility                  
              siting and collection route optimization.                                      
                   The evaluator for the Center will continue to develop the                 
              Center's case history, survey the Center's participants, attend the            
              required meetings and perform company exit interviews.                         
                   The Program Manager recommends Rutgers University be awarded              
              $50,000 for two (2) years for the joint "TIE" project and an                   
              additional $24,000 for three (3) years for the evaluator.
