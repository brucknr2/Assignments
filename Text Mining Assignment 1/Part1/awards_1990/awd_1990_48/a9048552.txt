Abstract    :
              The proposed Center is a partnership of five universities, two                 
              prominent community organizations, a national laboratory, a                    
              statewide business, education, and government alliance, and the                
              Chicago Public Schools.  The universities are Loyola (the lead                 
              institution), Chicago State, Illinois Institute of Technology,                 
              Southwestern University, and University of Illinois/Chicago.                   
              Fifteen programs will be conducted, under subcontracts, by the                 
              partner-institutions.  One of the programs to improve undergraduate            
              retention, Teaching Integrated Mathematics and Science (TIMS), will            
              receive a substantial grant from the Division of Teacher                       
              Preparation and Enhancement (DTPE) and the Division of Mathematics             
              (DMS), which will jointly support the Center with the Career Access            
              Program.  Program Components, in addition to TIMS, will address                
              their target-areas:  Teachers, Undergraduates, and Pre-College -               
              elementary, middle, and high school program activities will include            
              institutes, academics, tutorials, apprenticeships, and workshops               
              for parents and students.
