Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In a workshop held in Budapest and organized by Dr.                            
              William Rutter of the University of California-San                             
              Francisco and Dr. Laslo Graf of Eotvos Lorand University,                      
              U.S. and Hungarian biochemists will discuss results of                         
              their joint research on serine proteases.  In particular,                      
              their discussions will address functional interactions                         
              of catalytic residues and related issues of enzyme                             
              catalysis.  This supplement will ensure aequate                                
              representation of junior U.S. scientists in the meetings                       
              with the intention of encouraging new international                            
              research partnerships.
