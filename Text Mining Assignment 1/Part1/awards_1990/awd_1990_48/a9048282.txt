Abstract    :
                   This supplementary award funds Pennsylvania State University's            
              Industry/ University Cooperative Research Center for Dielectrics               
              to perform collaborative research with Rutgers University's                    
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Ceramics on a              
              project "Effects of Particle and Grain Size on the Phase                       
              Transitions and Dielectric Properties of Barium Titanate."  Both               
              Centers' Industry Advisory Boards have recommended and cost shared             
              this two year project.                                                         
                   A woman undergraduate is also funded to augment the Center's              
              research studying rate controlled sintering of electronic ceramic              
              materials.                                                                     
                   Three years of supplementary funding is also provided to                  
              maintain the evaluation protocols for the Center.                              
                   The Program Manager recommends that Pennsylvania State                    
              University be awarded $25,000 for each of two (2) years for a "TIE"            
              project with Rutgers University, totalling $50,000.  $24,000 for               
              three (3) years is also recommended for the evaluator costs.                   
              Another $5,000 for one (1) year is recommended for the woman                   
              undergraduate with funds from the Women, Minority and Disabled                 
              Engineering Research Assistants Program.
