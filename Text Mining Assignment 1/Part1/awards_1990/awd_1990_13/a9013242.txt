Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Western Washington University has established the Shannon Point                
              Marine Center (SPMC) as the focal point for new initiatives in                 
              research and education in marine science.  SPMC is strategically               
              located, providing direct access to a wide variety of marine and               
              estuarine habitats, including protected wetlands, macrophytes,                 
              estuarine marshes, and rocky intertidal zones.  The facilities of              
              SPMC provide opportunities for resident and visiting scientists                
              to implement research on local estuarine processes, such as                    
              productivity of various local watersheds, nutrient cycling and                 
              regeneration, microbial ecology, and benthic metabolism; on                    
              environmental impacts of petroleum refining; and on fish and                   
              invertebrate life histories.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This project provides partial funding to renovate existing                     
              presently under-utilized space for use as an analytical                        
              laboratory to provide a critical link between field measurement                
              and real time laboratory analysis.  The project is essential to                
              SPMC's developing focus on process-oriented research on marine                 
              and estuarine systems of the northern Puget Sound basin and its                
              continuing effort to accommodate the needs of visiting                         
              scientists.  The laboratory will also serve as a core facility                 
              for undergraduate research and training.
