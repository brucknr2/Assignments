Abstract    :
                   Mathematicians at Amherst, Hampshire, Holy Cross, Mount                   
              Holyoke, Smith and Williams Colleges and the University of                     
              Massachusetts at Amherst will set up a Regional Geometry                       
              Institute beginning in January of 1991.  The Institute will bring              
              together researchers, graduate students, undergraduate students                
              and college and high school faculty.  The overall theme of the                 
              Institute will be the interaction between geometry and                         
              computation.  The research part of the Institute will consider                 
              situations where computational techniques shed new light on                    
              classical geometric problems and it will examine topics that have              
              come to the fore because of the existence of such techniques.                  
              The educational part of the Institute will explore how computers               
              make it possible to uncover these themes at home and in the                    
              classroom and it will examine the opportunities this presents for              
              the geometry curriculum at the high school and undergraduate                   
              levels.
