Abstract    :
              This project supports a conference which focuses on techniques to              
              analyze problems associated with air and structure borne sound                 
              and vibration.  The techniques include sound intensity,                        
              structural intensity, modal analysis and synthesis, statistical                
              energy analysis, passive and active damping, boundary element                  
              methods, diagnostics and conditioning monitoring, material                     
              characterization, and non-destructive evaluation, active noise                 
              and vibration control, sound radiation and scattering, and finite              
              element analysis.  The techniques have potentially numerous                    
              applications in aircraft, spacecraft, buildings, and                           
              infrastructure systems.
