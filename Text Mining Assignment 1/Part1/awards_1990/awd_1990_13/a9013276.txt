Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Chemical, biochemical and biophysical investigations of the                    
              nickel containing cofactor, F430. will be pursued.  This                       
              cofactor is a required component of the enzyme methyl                          
              reductase, obtained form the methanogenic archaebacteria                       
              Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, which catalyzes the                      
              reductive conversion of a sulfur-bonded methyl group to                        
              methane.  Dr. Scott is interested in the involvement or role                   
              of the nickel in the production of the methane.  he will first                 
              investigate the coordination chemistry of the nickel containing                
              cofactor both in the isolated and in the enzyme-bond state.                    
              He will use a number of spectroscopic techniques (UV-visible,                  
              resonance Raman, magnetic circular dichroism, and nuclear                      
              magnetic resonance) to identify the ligands to the nickel of                   
              the cofactor in the purified enzyme.  he will try to generate,                 
              isolate and characterize the lower oxidation state nickel forms                
              of (1) the enzyme in intact cells, (2) the enzyme in purified                  
              form and (3) the cofactor alone to test the hypothesis that the                
              lower oxidation state nickel form is the actual form obtaining                 
              in vivo.
