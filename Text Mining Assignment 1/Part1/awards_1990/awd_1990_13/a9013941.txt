Abstract    :
                   Classical, semi-classical and quantum theories for                        
              strongly perturbed, nonlinear oscillators using a variety of                   
              novel theoretical approaches will be employed to understand the                
              quantum processes that mimic classical chaos.  Localization                    
              of wave functions and the striking phenomenon of "scars"                       
              associated with unstable, classical periodic orbits will be                    
              investigated as mechanisms which suppress classical chaos                      
              quantum mechanically.  Systems to be studied include Rydberg                   
              atoms in microwave and strong magnetic fields, and inelastic                   
              and reactive scattering in chemistry.
