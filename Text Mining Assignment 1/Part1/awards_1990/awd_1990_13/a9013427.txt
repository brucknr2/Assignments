Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal is for partial support for an international                 
              conference on reducing measurement errors in surveys.  NSF support will        
              defray costs of 20 special invited participants, noted experts in              
              survey methodology and measurement error.  The conference will be              
              interdisciplinary, as survey research constitutes an important means of        
              data collection in several of the social sciences.
