Abstract    :
              This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program will provide partial                
              travel costs for approximately twenty U.S. scientists attending                
              the Tenth IUPAC Conference on Physical Organic Chemistry, to be                
              held in Haifa, Israel from August 5-10, 1990.                                  
                                                                                             
              Individual grants averaging $1,000 will be awarded to                          
              successful applicants (to be selected by a committee comprised                 
              of the Principal Investigator and the other two U.S. members of                
              the organizing committee for the Conference).  The selection                   
              process will emphasize efforts to invite and assist the                        
              participation of women, underrepresented minorities, and                       
              younger chemists.  The IUPAC Conference on Physical Organic                    
              Chemistry traditionally has a broad scope, bringing together                   
              scientists from the diverse areas within physical organic                      
              chemistry.  This will foster interaction and collaborative                     
              research among members of the international scientific                         
              community.
