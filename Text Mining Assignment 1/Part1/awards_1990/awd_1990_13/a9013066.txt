Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This doctoral dissertation project involves an examination of                  
              regime changes in Latin America since the end of World War II.  The            
              question addressed is why the nations of the region tend to change             
              regimes in unison over a short period of time.  Previous literature has        
              tended to examine these changes within isolated periods, ignoring the          
              rest of Latin American history.  This project will test a political            
              theory (rather than an economic.deterministic one, which is the                
              major alternative in the literature) that can explain the entire time          
              span.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The support will provide travel funds for the student to travel to,            
              and in, Brazil to conduct elite interviews and undertake library               
              research.
