Abstract    :
              The Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve of Stanford University                    
              provides resident and visiting investigators with research                     
              opportunities in a diverse array of vegetational habitats.  The                
              size and spatial arrangements of these different habitats are                  
              constantly changing in response to climate variations.  Dr. Peter              
              Vitousek proposes to install a microcomputer-based image analysis              
              system at the Jasper Ridge Preserve, with which aerial survey                  
              photographs of the Preserve can be analyzed.  The Preserve's                   
              library of aerial photographs, combined with its meteorological                
              database, will provide an excellent foundation for studying the                
              impact of climate change on vegetational distributions.                        
                                                                                             
              The proposed equipment purchase will have a significant impact on              
              resident and visiting scientists at the Jasper Ridge Preserve.  A              
              variety of research projects will benefit from this state-of-the-              
              art image analysis system.  Many of the relevant research                      
              projects deal with ecosystem responses to climate change, which                
              is a topic of national importance.
