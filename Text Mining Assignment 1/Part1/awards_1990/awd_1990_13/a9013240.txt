Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Dr. Philip B. Shevlin at Auburn University,                 
              who is investigating the chemical reactions of single carbon                   
              atoms.  This work will provide new insights into the nature of                 
              an unusual class of chemical intermediates having simple                       
              molecular structures but very high reactivity.                                 
                                                                                             
              The experiments that will be carried out by Professor Shevlin                  
              will focus on the abstraction by atomic carbon of single atoms                 
              from hydrocarbons and halocarbons to generate the corresponding                
              monovalent methylidynes, C-H and C-X.  The reactions of                        
              methylidynes with arenes and aromatics having small fused rings                
              will be used to study and characterize this little-understood                  
              class of intermediates.  The large exothermicity of bond                       
              formation to atomic carbon will be employed in oxygen                          
              abstraction reactions of oxygenated organic compounds to form                  
              carbon monoxide and novel, high energy intermediates.
