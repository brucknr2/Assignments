Abstract    :
              A systematic calorimetric study of 2D helium films in the localized            
              and superfluid regimes, from 2K down to 50mK, is proposed for a                
              definitive test of the Kosterlitz-Thouless theory.  A variety of               
              substrates will be employed.  Secondly, thermal conductivity                   
              measurements will be made on helium in porous media, as a probe of             
              the mechanism involved.
