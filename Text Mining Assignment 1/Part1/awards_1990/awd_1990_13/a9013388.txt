Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will analyze and interpret geophysical data                       
              collected in the Barbados Accretionary Complex.  The goals and                 
              products of the project include:  (1)  development of a                        
              comprehensive picture of the relation between the 3-D surface                  
              morphology of the accretionary prism and subbottom structures,                 
              (2)  further definition of the distribution of heat flow in the                
              Barbados Ridge accretionary complex, (3)  characterization of the              
              fluid flux and fluid expulsion features in areas that have been                
              surveyed with seismic reflection methods and measurements of                   
              thermal, chemical  and pore pressure gradients, (4)                            
              determination of the permeability and thermal properties of                    
              sediments taken in cores and analysis of long-term in site pore-               
              pressure records obtained in 1988 to determine the in situ poro-               
              elastic properties, and (5)  further development of thermal and                
              hydrological models of accretionary complex development.
