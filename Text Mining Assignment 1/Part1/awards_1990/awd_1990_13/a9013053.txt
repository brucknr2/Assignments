Abstract    :
              This research involves the study of the two-dimensional electron               
              system in intense magnetic fields on GaAs/GaAlAs heterostructures              
              characterized by very high mobility, low-density two-dimensional               
              electron gas samples with extremely low disorder.                              
              Magnetotransport, activated transport and nonlinear transport                  
              measurements will be employed to investigate collective states of              
              this system.  The fractional quantum Hall effect, quantum Wigner               
              crystallization, and magnetic-field-induced localization will be               
              studied.  Radio-frequency magnetospectroscopy will also be used                
              to study collective excitations in these systems.
