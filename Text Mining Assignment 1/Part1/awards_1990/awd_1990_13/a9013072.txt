Abstract    :
                   The muonic molecular ions having He as a nucleus do not                   
              form bound states.  However, their resonant states play a role                 
              in  muon catalyzed fusion.  They are considered scavengers of                  
              muons.  At very high densities these resonances may enhance                    
              the stripping of muons from muonic He when its kinetic energy                  
              has been slowed down after (dt) or (dd) fusion.  Quantitative                
              investigation has been slowed down because very little is known                
              about these resonances.  A variational method, developed for                   
              the accurate determination of the (dt) bound state properties,                
              is well suited for studying these resonances.  Excellent                       
              resonance energies and widths have already been computed for a                 
              number of resonant states of (dt)+ below the n=2 threshold of                 
              (d) and (t).  Preliminary calculations indicate the existence                
              of similar resonances in (.d)++ and (3Hed)++.  The proposed                  
              research will provide accurate positions, widths and other                     
              properties of all these resonances.
