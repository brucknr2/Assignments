Abstract    :
                   The objective of the proposed study is to continue research               
              on the physical mechanisms of Quaternary glaciations.  Simple                  
              models of these mechanisms will be developed further, including                
              box models of the paleooceanic circulation, in addition to the                 
              previously-modeled radiation balance, ice-sheet mass balance and               
              hydrologic cycle.  Model results will be compared in the spectral              
              and temporal domain with marine and continental paleoclimatic                  
              data, including the Vostok ice-core records and marine records                 
              dated by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry.                                        
                   The previous research on the low-frequency variability of                 
              the atmosphere will also be extended, emphasizing intraseasonal                
              oscillations in the global atmosphere.  This research will                     
              proceed through theoretical studies with a hierarchy of simple                 
              and intermediate models, observational studies of the longest                  
              upper-air datasets, and the UCLA GCM.  The results of the study                
              will be valuable in helping us to narrow the gap in our                        
              understanding between paleoclimate and more the recent climate.
