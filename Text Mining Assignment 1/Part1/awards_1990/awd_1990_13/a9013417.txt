Abstract    :
                   This grant is for an international conference on active                   
              phenomena in solar system plasmas to be held in Hong Kong on                   
              February 11-15, 1991.  The goals of this conference are to                     
              encourage the exchange of ideas, observations, and theoretical                 
              models between scientists interested in earth and planetary                    
              magnetospheric physics, and cometary physics.  This conference                 
              will explore common concepts such as reconnection, turbulence,                 
              and parallel electric fields, and examine their roles in                       
              different environments.
