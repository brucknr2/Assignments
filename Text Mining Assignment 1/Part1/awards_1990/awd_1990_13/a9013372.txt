Abstract    :
              This project will study the dynamics of highly ionized                         
              capillary plasmas created by fast discharges and                               
              explore the possibility of amplifying extreme                                  
              ultraviolet radiation in a compact and simple                                  
              discharge device.  Efficient power density deposition                          
              in a capillary geometry can generate highly ionized                            
              plasmas with a high aspect ratio volume.  Large                                
              electron heat conduction to the capillary walls                                
              provides rapid plasma cooling at the end of the                                
              current pulse.  These conditions are ideal for an                              
              extreme ultraviolet recombination laser scheme.                                
                                                                                             
              We have already demonstrated the generation of                                 
              capillary plasmas 500 micrometers in diameter and 4                            
              cm long with a temperature of approximately 30 eV                              
              and a density of 1*1018cm-3 utilizing a discharge                              
              energy of only 5 Joules (1010W/cm3), and we have                               
              observed excitation of the 3-2 transition in hydrogenic                        
              lithium during plasma recombination.  Considering                              
              the favorable scaling of the gain with Z in a                                  
              recombining plasma, we will study the dynamics of a                            
              new type of capillary discharges, of shorter                                   
              pulsewidths and higher power density (1013 W/cm3),                             
              in relation to the possibility of amplification of the 3-                      
              2 transitions of BV (26.2 nm) and CVI (18.2 nm).                               
              The plasma conditions that will be generated during                            
              the current pulse are also of interest in the study of                         
              collisional excitation of Ne-like transitions of                               
              relatively low Z ions for the generation of laser                              
              radiation in the 28-70 nm spectral region.  The                                
              measurement of plasma resistivity and the                                      
              independent determination of the plasma density and                            
              temperature using XUV spectroscopic techniques and                             
              subpicosecond laser diagnostics will allow the study of                        
              fundamental physical processes governing the plasma                            
              behavior and provide a test for transport theories.
