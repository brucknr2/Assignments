Abstract    :
                   The University of Guam Marine Lab is a unique research                    
              facility in the central Pacific Ocean.  The Lab has an active                  
              research staff and hosts a steady stream of international                      
              investigators working in diverse disciplines.  The Lab also has                
              an excellent record of graduate and undergraduate training.                    
              Resident and visiting scientists have access to an array of                    
              shared equipment and instrumentation, and Dr. Ernest Matson                    
              proposes installation of a spectrophotometer and a diesel                      
              generator to augment these facilities.                                         
                   The proposed multi-user equipment acquisitions will have a                
              significant impact on the quantity and quality of research                     
              conducted at the Lab.  The generator will provide backup                       
              electricity during nighttime and weekend shutdowns, and the                    
              intermittent power failures caused by tropical storms.  The                    
              spectrophotometer will be an important addition to a diverse                   
              array of projects in marine ecology, systematic biology,                       
              biochemistry and physiology.
