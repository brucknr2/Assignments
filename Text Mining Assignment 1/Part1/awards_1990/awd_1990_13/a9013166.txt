Abstract    :
              This research involves exploring a background electronic trimming              
              principle to compensate for errors arising from the component                  
              mismatch and the process variations in data converters and filters             
              and to prove its effectiveness through theoretical simulations and             
              experimental prototyping.  The basic idea behind this work is to               
              replace the component trimming procedure usually done in the                   
              factory prior to chip packaging by a hidden electronic calibration             
              running in the background.  The goal is to improve the performance             
              of inherently fast data conversion and filtering systems by                    
              maintaining simple system architectures and moving the operation               
              of sophisticated trimming circuits to the background.  As a result,            
              systems of this kind can be faster than systems electronically                 
              calibrated in foreground.  This basic research will help to develop            
              a family of high-performance monolithic analog/digital interface               
              circuits with premium speeds not readily available in monolithic               
              forms.
