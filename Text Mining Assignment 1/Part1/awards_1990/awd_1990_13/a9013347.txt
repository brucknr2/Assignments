Abstract    :
              In this project ("Heavy Atom Isotope Effect Studies of Organic                 
              Reaction Mechanisms") in the Organic Chemical Dynamics Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Professor Arthur Fry in the                         
              Chemistry Department at the University of Arkansas,                            
              Fayetteville, will study  kinetic isotope effects in order to                  
              determine the details of the paths (mechanisms) by which                       
              molecules react.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This research project utilizes heavy atom isotope effect                       
              studies in determining mechanistic details for a variety of                    
              addition and elimination reactions.  Specific reaction systems                 
              on which carbon-14 isotope effect measurements and calculations                
              are being made are the Hofmann and Cope Elimination reactions,                 
              the solvolysis of substituted alpha-phenylethyl compounds, the                 
              decomposition of brominated cinnamic acids, the addition of                    
              arenesulfenyl chlorides to phenylethenes, and the addition of                  
              dibromine to 1,2-diphenylethenes, cinnamic acid esters, and                    
              phenylethynes.  Correlation of experimentally measured and                     
              theoretically calculated isotope effects will be used to                       
              determine details of transition state structure, motion through                
              the transition state, and the timing of bonding changes in                     
              chemical reactions.
