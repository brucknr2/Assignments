Abstract    :
                   Recent results show a sun/climate relationship subject to                 
              modulation by equatorial stratospheric winds, viz. the                         
              quasibiennial oscillation (QBO).  These results show responses                 
              of the atmospheric meteorological parameters to solar activity                 
              from the mesosphere down to the troposphere seem to be dependent               
              on the QBO phase.  This relationship will be examined in the                   
              context of atmospheric variables with emphasis on the link                     
              between the QBO and the extratropical atmosphere.  This involves               
              a two-fold effort: the investigation of the statistical                        
              significant of the solar/QBO/weather (climate) relationship, and               
              the study of dynamical links between tropical and extratropical                
              variability.  The statistical testing will involve the use of                  
              data from the surface to 10 mb, in all seasons.  Particular                    
              attention will be paid to details such as definition  of the QBO               
              phase, selection of averaging periods, and possibilities of QBO                
              modulation in either or both QBO phases.  The investigation of                 
              dynamical links will involve examining atmospheric data from the               
              surface to 1mb for evidence of QBO modulation of the                           
              extratropical atmosphere.  Since a mechanism for the                           
              QBO/extratropics connection may involve modulation of planetary                
              wave propagation, emphasis will be given to the propagation of                 
              planetary waves and their interaction with the mean flow.
