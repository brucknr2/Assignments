Abstract    :
              This is a travel award for a trip to England to visit faculty and              
              examine facilities at the University of London and Oxford and                  
              Cambridge Universities.  These visits are to identify the best                 
              match of interests and appropriateness of library holdings in                  
              preparation for a postdoctoral study program.  Initial contacts                
              have been made with faculty, who have expressed an interest in                 
              serving as postdoctoral mentor.  This travel award will enable the             
              investigator to meet with the various professors and make a choice             
              of the program best suited to her goals.  Initial discussions of               
              formal arrangements for a postdoctoral appointment will also be                
              held.
