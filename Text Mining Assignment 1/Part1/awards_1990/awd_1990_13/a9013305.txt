Abstract    :
              Under this Small Grant for Exploratory Research the Principal                  
              Investigator will examine the suitability of various liquid crystal            
              materials for use as programmable apertures in astronomical                    
              instruments.  If successful this technique could result in very                
              flexible designs for multi-object spectrographs, allowing rapid                
              reconfiguration of the focal plane to match any observing field and            
              condition.
