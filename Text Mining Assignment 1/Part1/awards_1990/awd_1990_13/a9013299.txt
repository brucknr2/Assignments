Abstract    :
                   This proposal is to complete the analysis of data taken from              
              the Santa Monica and Santa Cruz basins off California.  Since                  
              1985, deliberate tracers have been placed in the basins to                     
              measure directly the vertical diffusion coefficients.  These                   
              measurements have been supplemented by measurements of internal                
              waves, microstructure, and other ambient processes.  The analysis              
              should lead to estimates of mixing rates which are essential for               
              numerical models of ocean processes.
