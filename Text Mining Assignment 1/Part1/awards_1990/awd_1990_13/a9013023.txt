Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) on Douglas                
              Lake is among the oldest and largest facilities of its kind in                 
              the United States.  UMBS has been in continuous operation since                
              1909 with research at the station producing over 2200 scientific               
              publications and over 220 theses.  It is conservatively estimated              
              that 600 professional scientists employed in the United States                 
              have received training at UMBS and dozens of professional field                
              biologists conduct research there.                                             
                                                                                             
              Although much has been learned about the structure and function                
              of northern temperate ecosystems, the study of streams at UMBS                 
              has been hampered by the lack of a stream laboratory capable of                
              supporting controlled experiments, even though UMBS owns several               
              miles of pristine stream shoreline.  It is difficult to conduct                
              research on fish and other stream organisms without a central                  
              facility by the stream to support technical equipment.  In the                 
              past four years, there have been 19 Ph.D.-level research projects              
              and 39 graduate student research projects that could have                      
              benefited from a stream laboratory facility.                                   
                                                                                             
              This project will provide partial funding for a new stream                     
              laboratory to facilitate research on a range of ecological                     
              questions that are relevant to northern temperate streams.                     
              Results of this research will help scientists better understand                
              how stream ecosystems function and how they can be protected.
