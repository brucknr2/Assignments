Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Theoretical linguistics has been hampered by the lack of                       
              adequate and easily accessible grammatical information for a wide              
              range of languages.  This project intends to address these                     
              problems as follows:  (a) Adequacy: devise a detailed descriptive              
              framework, based on cross-linguistically valid analyses, in which              
              grammatical phenomena will be characterized in terms of both form              
              and function.  (b) Accessibility: implement this framework in a                
              flexible hypertext software environment that will serve as a tool              
              for the writing of grammars by field linguists and as a source of              
              cross-linguistic grammatical information for theoretical                       
              linguists.
