Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will use extreme value                                             
              statistical techniques to study the upper                                      
              tail distribution of wind speed data.  The                                     
              estimation of the tails of probability                                         
              distributions of extreme events is a                                           
              theoretical and engineering problem of                                         
              significance.  Hurricanes, tornadoes and                                       
              other high winds episodes produce every year                                   
              loss of life and substantive economic and                                      
              structural damages which could be curtailed                                    
              if prediction of extremes would be enhanced.                                   
              The purpose of this work is to improve the                                     
              extreme wind prediction capabilities and to                                    
              close the gap between the observed damage                                      
              statistics and those obtained by using                                         
              conventional distribution calibration                                          
              procedures.  Current design winds speeds are                                   
              based on the analysis of few decades of                                        
              weather service data at about 100 weather                                      
              stations.  An updated data base will be used                                   
              to test the hypothesis that the distribution                                   
              has a limited upper tail.  The physical basis                                  
              for the assumptions made will be tested,                                       
              followed by a calibration of conditional                                       
              exceedance and validation of this statistical                                  
              approach.
