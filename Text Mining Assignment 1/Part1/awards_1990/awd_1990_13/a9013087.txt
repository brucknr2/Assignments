Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Walter Meyerhof of Stanford                      
              University for collaborative research in physics with                          
              Professor Joerg Eichler of the Hahn-Meitner Institute,                         
              Berlin, Germany.  Professor Meyerhof and his group at                          
              Stanford have been studying atomic collision processes at                      
              high energy, mainly experimentally, in order to understand                     
              inner-shell electronic and radiative processes occurring                       
              during an atomic collision.  They have collaborated for many                   
              years with specialists in Europe and Latin America.  The main                  
              line of their experimental research is shifting now from the                   
              intermediate velocity to the extreme relativistic domain, in                   
              partnership with Dr. Harvey Gould of Lawrence Berkeley                         
              Laboratory.  In parallel with this experimental work,                          
              collaboration with theoretical physicists will be essential                    
              to provide the deep understanding necessary for relativistic                   
              processes.  Professor Eichler offers crucial theoretical                       
              expertise in the mechanisms of electron capture and in atomic                  
              collision processes at relativistic velocities.  To provide a                  
              good basis for their future work, Professors Eichler and                       
              Meyerhof are collaborating on a monograph that will discuss                    
              the theoretical approaches which have been used to date to                     
              treat relativistic atomic collisions and provide details                       
              about experimental techniques and results.
