Abstract    :
              The doctoral student is Michael N. Keas.  His topic is "The                    
              Structure and Philosophy of Group Research:  A. W. Hofmann's                   
              Research Program in London and Berlin."                                        
                                                                                             
              As a teacher, experimentalist, and organizer of science, August                
              Wilhelm von Hofmann (1818-1892) made an important contribution to              
              both British and German chemistry.  He improved the laboratory                 
              research and instructional methods developed by Justus Liebig in               
              Giessen and pondered their epistemological assumptions long after              
              Liebig had retreated to agricultural chemistry.  Hofmann became                
              the first professor of the British Royal College of Chemistry in               
              1845 and continued his teaching and research in London until 1865              
              when he accepted an invitation to direct the chemistry program at              
              the University of Berlin.  A number of his students and assistants             
              became prominent chemists in England and Germany.  Under this grant            
              for doctoral dissertation research support,  Mr. Keas aims to                  
              analyze the composition, organization, and methodology of A. W.                
              Hofmann's laboratory research group and to explain how these                   
              factors guided the group's choice and solution of research                     
              problems.  his approach combines tools of social and intellectual              
              history.  He hopes to show how the composition and organization of             
              the research group interacted both in harmonious and in conflicting            
              ways with Hofmann's academic goals and scientific presuppositions              
              to carry out a body of group research achievements.
