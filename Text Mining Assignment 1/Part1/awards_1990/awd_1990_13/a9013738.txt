Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on the Jones polynomial, an                      
              invariant in knot theory, and will use a new topological approach              
              which replaces the algebraic and combinatorial techniques with a               
              simpler geometric method.  This research should give a deeper                  
              understanding of a problem posed in one field by investigating it              
              in the language of other areas of connected knowledge.  The study              
              of the relations between this new geometric approach and those                 
              already established should lead to a better understanding of all               
              of this theory and provide a unified approach.                                 
                   Knot theory is an area of research in topology and algebra                
              that has a variety of applications to mathematical biology in the              
              description of DNA and to theoretical physics; in particular,                  
              conformal field theory and statistical mechanics.
