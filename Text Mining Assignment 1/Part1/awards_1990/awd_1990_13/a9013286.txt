Abstract    :
                   A continuation and expansion of previous studies of cold                  
              collision dynamics will be performed.  The present project will                
              concentrate efforts in two major areas:                                        
                   1. Associative ionization between excited sodium atoms                    
              within a Doppler selected velocity class one order of magnitude                
              narrower than previous studies.  This should enable the                        
              investigators to reach a temperature less than 3 milliKelvin                   
              without recourse to optical cooling and trapping.  The effects of              
              alignment, orientation and light will be studies in the regime                 
              where the time of collision is long compared to the radiative                  
              lifetime.                                                                      
                   2. Laser diodes and diode arrays will be used to cool and                 
              collimate atomic beams of rubidium and cesium in order to study                
              fine structure changing collisions.  The goal is to measure the                
              excitation function for this process from thermal to the                       
              ultracold regime.
