Abstract    :
              With the view that monoclonal antibodies are among the                         
              more important biochemicals of commercial value, the                           
              objective of the proposed research is to understand the                        
              basic biological phenomena of antibody synthesis, and to                       
              apply the results to the improvement of bioreactor                             
              operating strategies.  This project is focused on the                          
              probable cell cycle dependency of monoclonal antibody                          
              production, and will utilize flow cytometry with                               
              bromodeoxyuridine labeling to measure cell cycle                               
              parameters, and molecular biology techniques to probe                          
              transcriptional and post transcriptional regulation of                         
              antibody synthesis.  Data are to be incorporated into                          
              mathematical models which use cell cycle dependent                             
              kinetics.  The results should provide a mechanistic                            
              explanation of the experimental data, and should lead to                       
              a better understanding and improved production of                              
              monoclonal antibodies.
