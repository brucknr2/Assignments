Abstract    :
                   This program focuses on the major aerosol species that are                
              found in the marine atmosphere: nss-SO4=, from anthropogenic                   
              sources and biological sources in the ocean; MSA                               
              (methanesulfonate), form DMS (dimethyl sulfide) derived from                   
              oceanic sources; NO3-, from anthropogenic sources, lightning and               
              the stratosphere; NH4+, from continental and oceanic sources;                  
              Na+, from sea salts.  We also study (with the University of Rhode              
              Island) the mineral species present in the atmosphere in this                  
              region.  The major objective is to characterize the distribution               
              of these species over the ocean and to understand the factors                  
              that control their concentration; the sources of the species and               
              their temporal and areal variability; the transport paths through              
              the atmosphere and the removal to the ocean.
