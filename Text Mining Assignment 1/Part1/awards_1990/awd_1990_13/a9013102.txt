Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Established in 1896, the Flathead Lake Biological Station                 
              (FLBS) has a long tradition of field-based education and                       
              research.  In 1980, emphasis on limnology was initiated.  FLBS                 
              now has a 15-member staff and an annual budget of $700,00 (60%                 
              extramural).  An additional $2 million has been invested in new                
              housing and a Freshwater Research Lab.  NSF awards have provided               
              a 30` research vessel (1987-88) and research on stream hyporheos               
              (1987-90) and food webs of oligotrophic lakes (1990-92).  FLBS                 
              research and monitoring (e.g., daily discharge and temperature;                
              chemical variables and biota) has generated long-term data bases               
              for over 50 sites in the 22,241 km2 Flathead River Basin.  For                 
              example, limnological and hyrological data for Flathead Lake date              
              to 1902.  Because these data bases are essential to research on                
              the structure and function of the Flathead River-Lake Ecosystem,               
              a data archival and management will be developed and enhance                   
              continuous data acquisition capability around long-term research               
              objectives.  A computer system for data base management, a                     
              midlake buoy and weather station for Flathead Lake and global                  
              positioning (GPS) and automated water column profiling systems                 
              (i.e., continuous GPS, CDT, transmissometer and sonar data logged              
              on a portable computer for input to existing GIS for the research              
              vessel are to be acquired.  These items, coupled with existing                 
              data loggers, sensors and samplers, compose the hardware of the                
              data base system.  A full-time person will be employed to                      
              coordinate routine data acquisition and to manage FLBS data bases              
              for research use and for the needs of visiting investigators.
