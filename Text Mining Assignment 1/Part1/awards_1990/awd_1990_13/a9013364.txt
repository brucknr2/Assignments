Abstract    :
                   Experimental tests of the theory of spin exchange                         
              collisions in ground state hydrogen, including hyperfine                       
              effects, will be performed.  Measurements of hyperfine induced                 
              frequency shift cross sections will be made near .5 Kelvin in                  
              collaboration with the University of British Columbia using                    
              their supercooled hydrogen maser.  The same measurements but at                
              10 Kelvin will be performed at Williams College using the                      
              apparatus developed during the previous grant.  The results will               
              test the theoretical treatment of low energy atomic collisions to              
              the degree to which collisions between hydrogen atoms may limit                
              the stability of cryogenic hydrogen maser frequency standards.
