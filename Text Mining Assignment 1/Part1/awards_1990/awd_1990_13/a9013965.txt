Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research project is to attack the issues of                
              programming and performance evaluation of multiprocessor systems.              
              This is done by a systematic selection of several representative               
              problems in the numerical as well as the non-numerical domain and              
              their implementation on a machine based on Inmos Transputers.                  
              Comparison with off-the-shelf multiprocessors (e.g. Sequent and                
              Alliant) will be undertaken.  The work will proceed with theoretical           
              efforts in developing highly programmable user environments as well as         
              experimental work in assessing the validity of the functional parallel         
              programming approach.
