Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research will be conducted on the interaction of intense                       
              radiation (synchrotron radiation) with materials.  X-Ray                       
              Resonance Exchange Scattering (XRES) will be studied to determine              
              its range of applications and the information obtainable form                  
              magnetic and other materials.  A comprehensive theoretical study               
              will be conducted on coherent nuclear excitations induced by                   
              synchrotron radiation pulses in small samples.  Applications to                
              solid state physics, Angstrom-level sensitive, long baseline                   
              interferometry, and to metrology will be considered.  Resources                
              permitting, studies will also be undertaken on gamma ray lasers.
