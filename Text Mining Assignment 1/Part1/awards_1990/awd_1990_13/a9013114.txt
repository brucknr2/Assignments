Abstract    :
              This research equipemt award wil be used to purchase a Resonant                
              Column Device, a soil testing device.  The dynamic response of                 
              soils will be studied.  Applications include earthquakes, vibrating            
              machinery foundations, blast effects on foundation, and i general              
              soils and doundations subjected to dynamic loads.
