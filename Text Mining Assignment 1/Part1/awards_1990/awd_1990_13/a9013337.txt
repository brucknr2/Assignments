Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Boron-doped Niii3Al is used as model material to study the basic               
              mechanisms of deformation and failure in superplasticity of                    
              intermetallic compounds.  Experimental measurements of grain                   
              boundary sliding are made by means of internal markers.                        
              Internal friction due to grain boundary sliding is measured and                
              the parameters from damping capacity and mechanical testing are                
              correlated.  Effect of hydrostatic gas pressure on cavitation in               
              superplasticity of nickel aluminide is studied.
