Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will investigate the response of stream ecosystems               
              to nutrient limitation and the response of nutrient-limited stream             
              ecosystems to different types of environmental disturbances.                   
              Specific objectives are to (1) determine the role of in-place                  
              recycling of a limiting nutrient within the benthic boundary region            
              of natural stream reaches, (2) determine the spatial variation in              
              recycling both among streams and longitudinally within a stream,               
              and whether recycling varies in a predictable way, and (3) test                
              some theoretical predictions about the relationship between                    
              ecosystem resilience/resistance and in-place nutrient recycling in             
              natural streams, including the effect of longitudinal                          
              nonuniformities in nutrient availability and recycling due to                  
              spatial heterogeneity in nutrient input and within-stream nutrient             
              uptake.  The overall goal is to better understand the factors                  
              regulating the structure and productivity of benthic communities               
              in lotic ecosystems, including their resistance and resistance to              
              disturbances that include scouring, toxicant pulses, and changes               
              in nutrient input.  The proposed work will be achieved by combining            
              theoretical analyses using mathematical models with empirical                  
              studies using both natural and laboratory streams that can be                  
              experimentally manipulated and to which releases of radiotracers               
              can be made to quantify nutrient cycling processes under ambient               
              conditions.  The network of large-scale laboratory streams and the             
              ability to use radiotracers in natural streams are unique                      
              capabilities for conducting stream ecosystem research at Oak Ridge             
              National Laboratory.
