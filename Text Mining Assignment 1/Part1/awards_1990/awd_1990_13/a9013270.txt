Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a proposal for a two-year study of the feeding                    
              ecology and positional behavior of lowland gorillas (Gorilla                   
              gorilla gorilla) at the Dzanga-Sangha Reserve in the Central                   
              African Republic.  The work follows a three month pilot study                  
              which assessed the feasibility of this study.  The objectives of               
              the study are to document the frequency of locomotor and postural              
              behavior in the context of feeding and other activities, and to                
              do an intraspecific comparison of the effects of body size                     
              dimorphism on the use of arboreal substrates to gain access to                 
              food.  Virtually all of our knowledge of gorilla behavior at this              
              time comes form extensive studies of a different subspecies, the               
              mountain gorilla which is almost completely terrestrial.  The                  
              preliminary pilot study of the lowland gorilla indicated that it               
              spends a great deal of time feeding in an arboreal context.  This              
              is unexpected in view of what anthropologists currently know                   
              about gorillas.  This study will help to elucidate geographic                  
              variation in gorilla ecology and behavior.  It will also provide               
              critical information for understanding the relationship between                
              hominoid body size and locomotor behavior.
