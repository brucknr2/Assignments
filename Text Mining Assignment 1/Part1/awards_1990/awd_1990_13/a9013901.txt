Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A three-day Charge Coupled Device (CCD) "School" for current and               
              future users of CCD systems will be held.  Unlike previous CCD                 
              meetings, this meeting will NOT be organized as a meeting where                
              CCD experts give talks to other CCD experts about their latest                 
              results.  Instead, it will be a school in the true sense.                      
              Sessions will be conducted by CCD experts in specific areas, and               
              they will consist of self contained lectures on specific topics.               
              There will be ample time for questions and discussion.                         
                                                                                             
              The target students consist of three main groups:  1) teachers at              
              small colleges and universities, 2) graduate students, and 3)                  
              advanced undergraduates.  All three categories should be well                  
              represented, and the participants should be novice CCD users.                  
              The school will be limited in size so that interactions                        
              between experts and the students is maximized.                                 
                                                                                             
              The proceedings of this meeting will be self-contained chapters                
              written by the teachers from their detailed lecture notes.  They               
              will be published in a timely and affordable manner, and this                  
              book can then serve as a reference source as well as a possible                
              book for a class on observational astronomy.
