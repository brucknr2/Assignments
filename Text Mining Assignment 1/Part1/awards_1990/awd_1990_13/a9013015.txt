              April 17-18, 1990                                                              
              Washington, D.C.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The White House Conference, hosted by President Bush, is designed              
              as an important step towards substantially enhancing and                       
              broadening international understanding of the critical science                 
              and economic research issues, framing a strategy for implementing              
              a joint international science and economics research effort and                
              linking that knowledge to the policy process.                                  
                                                                                             
              The Conference will be devoted to science and economic issues                  
              relevant to policies on global change, including climate.  The                 
              primary objectives of the Conference are to:

              international knowledge in scientific and economic                             
              research,                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Identify major gaps and uncertainties in both                                  
              scientific and economic understanding,                                         
                                                                                             
              Assess the analytic tools and data that are found to be                        
              essential to improving both national and international                         
              environmental policy, and sensitizing the three                                
              communities involved to the activities and needs of the                        
              others in addressing global change research, and.                              
                                                                                             
              Develop a joint "Strategy Document" in which the                               
              expertise, experience, and data available in the                               
              participating countries can be brought together in a                           
              more integrated and coherent fashion to address global                         
              change issues.
