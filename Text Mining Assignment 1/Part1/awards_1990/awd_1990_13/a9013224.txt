Abstract    :
                   Precipitation will be collected as part of Phase II of the                
              AEROCE network in the North Atlantic and analyzed for the trace                
              metals Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn.  The purpose is to;                 
              (1)  characterize the trace metal chemistry of North Atlantic                  
              atmosphere, and (2)  assess the impact of continental emissions                
              of trace metals on atmospheric chemical processes, as well as the              
              impact of their deposition on biogeochemical cycles in the North               
              Atlantic Ocean.  Specifically the data will be used to; (1)                    
              determine the source and flux of trace metal emissions from                    
              continents surrounding the North Atlantic, and (2)  evaluate the               
              deposition and impact of continentally derived trace metals on                 
              biogeochemical processes of seawater.
