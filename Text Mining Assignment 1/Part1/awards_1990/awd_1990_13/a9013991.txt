Abstract    :
              This grant will support research in machine learning for control               
              of nonlinear dynamical systems.  Drs. Jordan and Jacobs will                   
              study multinetwork connectionist architectures for discovering                 
              picewise control strategies, comparing alternative decompositions              
              of control tasks, and learning multiple tasks simultaneously.                  
              They expect multinetworks to show faster learning rates, better                
              generalization, more interpretable representations, and more                   
              efficient use of hardware than single neural networks.
