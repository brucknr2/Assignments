Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The chambered nautilus (Nautilus spp.) is the sole surviving                   
              genus of the once dominant externally-chambered cephalopods.                   
              Nautilus achieves its near-neutral buoyance in seawater via                    
              the gas-filled chambers of its heavy protective shell.  The                    
              siphuncle, the organ that passes through the animal's                          
              chambers, removes the cameral liquid which initially fills                     
              the chambers, and allows gas (mostly N2) to enter.  Thus, the                  
              siphuncle is the organ responsible for nautilus' buoyancy.                     
              To understand how the siphuncle empties and partially fills                    
              chambers, studies of this transport and electrophysiology and                  
              required.  Prior to writing a formal proposal involving                        
              microelectrode and flux experiments, preliminary studies are                   
              required to show that the appropriate measurements can be                      
              made on siphuncular cells in vitro.  This SGER proposal will                   
              attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of those methods.                       
              This SGER proposal is exploratory and high risk because in                     
              vitro studies of the siphuncle have never been done and there                  
              is no quarantee that the siphuncle is a useful system for                      
              microelectrode and tracer experiments.***
