Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Veronica Vaida will study the                   
              effects on the reactivity of a given species when it is                        
              associated with "solvent" molecules as part of a small cluster.                
              Such studies aid in understanding the changes in properties of                 
              a species in going from a single isolated entity to a                          
              condensed-phase form.  These studies also impact on the                        
              reactivity of atmospheric species, which are often present in                  
              the form of small gas-phase clusters, and as such have a                       
              bearing, for example, on the formation and dissipation of smog.                
                                                                                             
              In the current studies, molecules which are solvated in small                  
              clusters will be photodissociated.  Various properties, such as                
              absorption cross sections and quantum yields for                               
              photodissociation, will be compared between isolated and                       
              solvated species.  The emergence of new channels for                           
              photodissociation of the solvated species will be investigated.
