Abstract    :
              Narrative understanding requires the use of large amounts of                   
              generic knowledge about word meanings, the world, and narrative                
              structure.  Such knowledge is typically unreliable                             
              ("defeasible"), and raises difficult representational problems.                
              The aim of this research is to develop a direct, natural,                      
              formally interpretable representation for this kind of knowledge,              
              taking English formulations of the knowledge as an initial                     
              representation, and translating systematically (ultimately,                    
              automatically) into the formal representation.  Certain classes                
              of English generic sentences can already be mapped directly into               
              the logic, but the research will greatly expand these classes,                 
              allowing virtually any generalization expressible in English to                
              be directly formalized.  The result will be not only theoretical               
              insights into the nature of unreliable general knowledge, but                  
              also further development of an extensible narrative understanding              
              system, whose general knowledge base can be expanded through                   
              English input.
