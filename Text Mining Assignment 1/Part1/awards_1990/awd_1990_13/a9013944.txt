Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research award will support a graduate student               
              in anthropology in a field study of the role of secrecy and                    
              knowledge in a highland group in Papua New Guinea.  Most previous              
              studies have examined reciprocal exchanges as the basis of social              
              life in this sort of group; this research looks at the refusal to              
              exchange, by keeping secret valuable practical knowledge, to see               
              how that constrains social relations.  Methods include                         
              participant observation and structured interviewing.                           
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it modifies the position that               
              shared knowledge is the basis of social life in small societies.               
              In fact the possession of secret knowledge is an important fact                
              in every social system, and this project will shed light on how                
              one small-scale society uses secrecy to establish and maintain                 
              social relations.  The case study will be valuable as a                        
              comparison to small-group studies of knowledge exchange in group               
              process.
