Abstract    :
                   Isolated teeth, and jaw fragments containing teeth,                       
              represent a significant proportion of early hominid fossils.                   
              These specimens are the focus of continuing interest and study,                
              and will contribute to future debates on hominid phylogeny.                    
              Current methods of analysis of differences between teeth of                    
              purportedly different species are limited by current                           
              methodologies.  This project will implement new three dimensional              
              laser scanning technologies to record and analyze differences                  
              between postcanine dental crowns of known hominoid species and                 
              apply the same technology to the assessment of fossil molars.                  
              The data for each crown surface, which generally exceeds 33,000                
              discreet 3D surface points per crown, will be stored and analyzed              
              in a modified computer assisted design system.  Superimposition                
              and simple finite element scaling techniques will be used to                   
              analyze surface data from the teeth.  These data should prove                  
              instrumental in revealing new and useful phylogenetic as well as               
              functional patterns in hominoid molars.
