Abstract    :
                   The LSU group will continue operation of their sensitive                  
              cryogenic bar gravity wave antenna, running in coincidence with                
              other operational detectors worldwide.  Data collected will be                 
              analyzed to set limits on the flux of gravitational waves                      
              bathing the Earth.                                                             
              In addition, improvements to transducers and amplifiers will be                
              carried out to further increase the sensitivity of this                        
              detector.  Some small-scale studies will explore alternatives                  
              for a more advanced cryogenic receiver.
