Abstract    :
              Dr. Clouse is requesting funds to conduct a one year pilotprogram              
              on the effects of a novel plant growth steroid,brassinolide (BR),              
              on gene expression during development. He hason hand the                       
              chemically pure compound, a set of molecular probesand transgenic              
              plants and three assay systems with which toobtain, within one                 
              year, definitive answers about thefeasibility of establishing a                
              long.term program on the action ofthis steroid compound on the                 
              transcription of plant genesinvolved in growth and                             
              differentiation. No work on the action ofthis compound on gene                 
              transcription has been reported and thelack of preliminary                     
              molecular data make this unsuitable for afull scale proposal. BR               
              has pronounced effects on plant growthand development, interacts               
              with other plant growth regulators andshares structural                        
              similarities with animal steroid hormones. Ithas immense                       
              potential as a tool for probing gene expressionduring development              
              and as an agricultural growth promoter.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Nothing  is known about the mechanism of action of                             
              brassinolide. This pilot study will determine if it has a                      
              proximal effect ongene expression. If so then a larger research                
              effort would bewarranted.
