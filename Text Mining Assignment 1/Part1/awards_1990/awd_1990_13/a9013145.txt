Abstract    :
              The high field NMR Spectrometer is the single most important                   
              tool available to organic and inorganic chemists for structure                 
              determination and it is becoming a significantly useful                        
              technique for analytical chemists and biochemists.                             
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to the                    
              Department of Chemistry at Florida Institute of Technology, an                 
              undergraduate institution, will improve the ability of the                     
              Department to educate undergraduate students and will enhance                  
              chemical research on the following projects:
