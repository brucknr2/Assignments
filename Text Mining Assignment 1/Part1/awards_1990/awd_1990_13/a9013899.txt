Abstract    :
              This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface                    
              chemistry and in the subfield of mass spectrometry.                            
              The PI will support the travel of young faculty and graduate                   
              students to the Internaional Conference in Mass Spectrometry to                
              be held in Amsterdam in August of 1991.  This is a most                        
              important triennial meeting for this field of science and the                  
              impact of the grant on these young scientists will be enormous.                
              A subcommittee of the Board of Directors of the American                       
              Society of Mass Spectrometry will choose the persons receiving                 
              support.
