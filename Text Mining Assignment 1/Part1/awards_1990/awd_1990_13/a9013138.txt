Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Professor                 
              Simon's time-resolved investigations of solute relaxation,                     
              charge transfer, and electron solvation in liquid media.  These                
              studies give important insight into detailed dynamical                         
              processes in the liquid state.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Using a variety of steady state and ultrafast time-resolved                    
              techniques, he is examining how solvent dielectric friction                    
              influences molecular rotational motions and the localization                   
              and solvation of photogenerated electrons.  The role of dynamic                
              solvation and vibrational relaxation in charge transfer is also                
              being studied.  A new approach based on time-resolved                          
              measurement of circular dichroism is being applied to the study                
              of solute relaxation both in polar and nonpolar fluids.  The                   
              effects of solvent friction on intramolecular rotations around                 
              bonds, on molecular inversion, and on structural relaxation on                 
              ground state potential surfaces are being examined.
