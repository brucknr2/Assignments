Abstract    :
              Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory at Columbia University                   
              will acquire a 35 mm film scanning device that will be made                    
              available to investigators throughout the Northeast.  The                      
              scanner digitizes black & white and color film with very high                  
              resolution.  The digital data can then be cataloged and                        
              stored on a variety of computer devices.  It will be used for                  
              processing films of the seafloor and will be especially                        
              useful for stereo pairs from which bottom roughness spectra                    
              can be computed.  Other research applications include the                      
              assembly of geological cross-sections of submarine escarp-                     
              ments, relative age dating of lava flows, and color profiling                  
              of sediment cores.  It will also provide a capability to                       
              digitally archive large collections of seafloor photographs                    
              obtained by towed camera vehicles and manned submersibles.
