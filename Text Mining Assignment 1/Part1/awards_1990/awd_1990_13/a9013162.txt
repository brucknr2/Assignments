Abstract    :
                   This research concerns optimality issues in maintenance                   
              strategies with general degree of repair.  The degree of repair is             
              a decision variable.  Optimal structure of repair policies is to               
              be characterized as well as employment of analytical and numerical             
              tools for efficient computation.                                               
                   Results from this research will increase the knowledge base               
              for maintaining models since it will permit greater options in the             
              selection of decision policies.
