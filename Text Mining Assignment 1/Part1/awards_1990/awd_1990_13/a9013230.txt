Abstract    :
              This project will produce a concept design for an intermediate                 
              ice-capable research vessel.  The design, based on science                     
              mission requirements for an intermediate (about 60 meters)                     
              research vessel for operation in the western arctic, will provide              
              a technical description of the ship including expected speed,                  
              power, stability, seakeeping, range and endurance.  General                    
              arrangements including inboard and outboard profiles, machinery                
              and science arrangements and an artist's conceptual drawing will               
              also be provided.  The design will be used for planning and                    
              assessment by the National Science Foundation and the scientific               
              oceanographic research community.                                              
                                                                                             
              The Project is under the direction of Professors Vera Alexander,               
              Robert Elsner and Thomas Royer of the University of Alaska with                
              assistance from an oversight committee from the University-
