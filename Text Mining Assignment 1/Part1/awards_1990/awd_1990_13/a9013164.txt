Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Marine Science Center of Northeastern University is the               
              only marine station with year-round research and teaching                      
              facilities, as well as resident faculty and staff, located on the              
              coast of New England north of Cape Cod.  It is also the only such              
              marine laboratory within an hour's drive of most universities in               
              the greater Boston area.  The location, well north of Boston                   
              Harbor, provides high quality seawater and excellent intertidal                
              and subtidal habitats for field study and organism collection.                 
              Funded research at the Marine Science Center encompasses a                     
              variety of projects in marine ecology, behavior, neurobiology,                 
              structural biology, biochemistry and molecular biology.                        
                                                                                             
                   At present, development of new projects and addition of new               
              resident and visiting investigators are severely limited by                    
              available research space.  This award will increase research                   
              space by providing partial funding for a 6000 square foot                      
              addition to the present laboratory building and two pieces of                  
              badly needed equipment.  The expansion will provide space                      
              critically needed for funded projects by resident faculty, other               
              investigators from Northeastern University, and visiting                       
              researchers from other academic institutions in the Boston area,               
              other parts of the U.S. and overseas.
