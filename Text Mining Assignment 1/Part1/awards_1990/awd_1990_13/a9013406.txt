Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent oceanographic surveys by Dr. Charles Paull and others                   
              along the West Florida Escarpment discovered cold water brine                  
              seeps that support chemosynthesis in isolated biologic                         
              communities, and contribute to  erosion at the base of the                     
              carbonate platform. Evidence is mounting that the spectacular                  
              discharge of hot vent waters along spreading ridges may be                     
              volumetrically dwarfed by discharge along continental margins.                 
              Dr. Speiss has been awarded funds to conduct a Deep-Tow survey                 
              in collaboration with Dr. Paull to extend investigations of                    
              suspected brine seeps to the eastern side of Florida. Two                      
              regions will be surveyed: a salt diapir on the continental rise                
              off Georgia, and the base of the Blake-Bahama Escarpment. The                  
              diapir breaches the seafloor, and will be examined to establish                
              the chemistry of pore fluids and sediments brought to the                      
              seafloor, and to determine the effects of this discharge on                    
              local erosion and biology. The nature of erosion will be                       
              examined along the precipitous Blake-Bahama Escarpment, and the                
              possible contributions of tectonic, bottom current, and                        
              chemical destruction will be evaluated.
