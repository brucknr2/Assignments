Abstract    :
              This research is directed at efficient high speed signal processing            
              algorithms and architectures and includes theoretical study as well            
              as conceptual design and simulation.  In particular, wavelet                   
              transforms and related techniques for generalized harmonic analysis            
              of data at multiple resolutions are considered.  The relationship              
              between time-frequency representations such as a Wigner-Ville                  
              Distribution and the wavelet time-scale representations are being              
              explored.  The time-scale representations are applied to areas such            
              as parameter estimation, spectral estimation, signal estimation and            
              enhancement.
