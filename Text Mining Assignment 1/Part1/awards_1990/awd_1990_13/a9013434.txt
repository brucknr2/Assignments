Abstract    :
                   Theoretical investigations are performed for the                          
              interaction of laser light with atoms.  The result is the                      
              excitation and/or ionization of one or more atomic electrons                   
              and perhaps the generation of radiation at wavelengths                         
              different from those of the laser.  Mathematical and                           
              computational methods will be developed to account for the                     
              coupling of the intense laser radiation to the atomic electrons                
              and to the details of the atomic structure.  Predictions will                  
              be employed in the interpretation of ongoing experiments and                   
              provide a guide for the design of future experiments.
