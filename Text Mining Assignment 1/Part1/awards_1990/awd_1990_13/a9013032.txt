Abstract    :
                   The AEROCE Primary Network Operations Group (PNOG) is                     
              located at the Center for Atmospheric Chemistry Studies, Graduate              
              School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island.  This group                
              will continue operating primary field sites at Tudor Hill,                     
              Bermuda and Mace Head, Ireland.  AEROCE primary sites are and                  
              will continue to be state-of-the-art atmospheric sampling                      
              facilities which support a wide range of atmospheric chemistry                 
              measurements.  Aerosol, gas and precipitation samples are                      
              collected at these sites in accordance with protocols described                
              in the AEROCE Overview.  The Facilities at each site include a                 
              walk-up tower, a chemical clean laboratory with two laminar flow               
              clean hoods, an instrument laboratory and sampling equipment                   
              shelters.  Sampling equipment for aerosol and precipitation                    
              samples are mounted on the towers and are controlled by automatic              
              control systems.  Analytical instruments that measure ozone are                
              housed in the instrument laboratory.  A full-time on-site                      
              technician operates each site.  The PNOG receives site data and                
              aerosol samples from the field sites and redistributes the                     
              materials as required by AEROCE investigators.
