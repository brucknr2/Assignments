Abstract    :
                   Precipitation will be sampled on a daily basis at three                   
              sites in the marine boundary layer of the North Atlantic Ocean                 
              (NAO) as part of the Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment                     
              (AEROCE).  Samples will be analyzed for major chemical                         
              constituents and resulting data will be interpreted in                         
              conjunction with other chemical and meteorological data sets                   
              generated as part of, or in collaboration with, the program to                 
              address the following scientific objectives:  1) determine the                 
              wet and dry deposition fluxes of major S and N species to the                  
              NAO; 2) differentiate natural from anthropogenic sources for                   
              major S and N species as a function of season, year and synoptic               
              situation; 3) assess the relative importance of particulate-                   
              versus vapor-phase scavenging by precipitation; and 4)                         
              investigate the impact of atmospheric deposition on marine                     
              productivity.  Results of this study will contribute to the                    
              development of a predictive capability for the biogeochemical                  
              cycling of major and trace chemical species through the NAO                    
              troposphere.
