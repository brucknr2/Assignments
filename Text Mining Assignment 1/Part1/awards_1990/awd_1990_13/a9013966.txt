Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a workshop on neuroendocrine strategies                
              in a tropical environment in conjunction with the 101st Annual                 
              Meeting of the American Society of Zoologists in San Antonio,                  
              Texas.  The workshop, organized by Professors Barney Schlinger                 
              and Arthur Arnold of UCLA, will focus on tropical ecology and                  
              its relevance to neuroendocrine mechanisms in animal physiology                
              and behavioral ecology.  The meeting will highlight ongoing                    
              research in comparative neuroendocrinology within Latin                        
              America as well as studies utilizing neotropical animals.                      
                                                                                             
              The tropical regions of the New World are considered by many                   
              to contain the greatest biological diversity of any region on                  
              the planet.  This region is currently experiencing intense                     
              pressure from rapid development, including massive deforesta-                  
              tion and destructive land-use practices, actions that will                     
              detrimentally affect animal populations.  This Science in                      
              Developing Countries award will help to promote collaboration                  
              and exchange of ideas between North American and Latin                         
              American comparative neurobiologists and endocrinologists in                   
              a topic of strong mutual interest.
