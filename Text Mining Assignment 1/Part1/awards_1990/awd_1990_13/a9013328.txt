Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program in                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Szalewicz will develop new                   
              methods which allow the accurate prediction of molecular                       
              properties and apply these methods to small molecules of                       
              chemical interest.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The PI will employ a basis set of Gaussian type geminals which                 
              will explicitly contain the interelectronic distance. This                     
              basis set will be used within the framework of high-level many                 
              body perturbational and coupled cluster methods. The method                    
              will be applied to diatomic and multi-center molecules                         
              containing up to about twenty electrons. Specific problems in                  
              spectroscopy and structural chemistry will be investigated.
