Abstract    :
                   This is an award to the National Academy of Sciences for the              
              operation of the Committee on Geophysical Data (CGD).                          
                   The CGD will give priority to the needs for environmental                 
              data and information to support global change research.  It will               
              work with the Interagency Working Group on Data Management for                 
              Global Change in developing national and international plans and               
              will continue activities related to World Data Center-A and U.S.               
              national data centers.                                                         
                   The CGD has, over the last two years, been deeply involved                
              in defining the elements of a strategy for global change data and              
              information management.  With a membership drawn from a number of              
              environmental disciplines, the CGD has attempted to represent the              
              views of a broad segment of the environmental science research                 
              community                                                                      
                   This award will enable the CGD to continue its close liaison              
              with the IWG and to put a major emphasis on giving advice on the               
              scientific aspects of global change data management.
