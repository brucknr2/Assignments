Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A central issue in developmental neurobiology is the role of                   
              cell-cell interactions in regulating neuronal differentiation.                 
              Astrocytes secrete factors that influence neuronal                             
              differentiation, including S-100 beta, a factor that affects                   
              serotonergic neurons.  In turn, the secretion of S-100 beta from               
              astrocytes is regulated by activation of serotonergic neurons.                 
              The mechanisms of these cellular interactions will be                          
              investigated at the molecular level by studying the                            
              transcription, translation and release of S-100 beta.  In                      
              addition, the regulatory role of steroid hormones, specifically                
              the glucocorticoids, in these processes will be studied.  The PI               
              will undertake these studies at Cold Spring Harbor during a one                
              year Sabbatical leave where he will be trained in molecular and                
              protein techniques in the laboratory of Dr. Daniel Marshak.
