Abstract    :
                   The PIs developed a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer                   
              (GC/MS) under NSF grant ATM-8717861 and coupled it with                        
              isotopically labeled internal standards  for near real-time                    
              determinations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), dimethyl sulfide (DMS),                
              carbon disulfide (CS2), and carbonyl sulfide (OCS) in the                      
              atmosphere.  In its present configuration, the GC/MS can be used               
              for measurements in relatively mild turbulent conditions such as               
              those encountered in the marine mixed layer.  These four compounds             
              can be measured with an average frequency of one per 8 minutes                 
              using simultaneously collected air samples.                                    
                   The PIs plan to modify the sample handling and calibration                
              systems to achieve response times of three minutes with detection              
              limits of 1 part-per-trillion by volume (pptv) with a precision of             
              1 pptv.  They also plan to install a turbomolecular pump that will             
              allow uninterrupted use of the GC/MS under the turbulent conditions            
              that occur in aircraft in the continental boundary layer and on                
              ships under a wide range of sea states.  With this added capability            
              the GC/MS could be used to conduct atmospheric chemistry                       
              experiments which are designed to evaluate fluxes and budgets of               
              sulfur gases, to measure ocean-atmosphere exchange of sulfur gases,            
              to study sources and sinks of OCS and CS2, and to study chemical               
              transformation of dimethyl sulfide and sulfur dioxide and their                
              role in affecting climate via aerosol formation in the troposphere.
