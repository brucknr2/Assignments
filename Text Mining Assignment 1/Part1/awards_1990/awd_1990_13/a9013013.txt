Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is the development of an integrated set              
              of tools for the logical and physical design of sequential circuits            
              with reduced area and improved performance.  The proposed research             
              is developing analytical techniques for synthesis of sequential                
              circuits by means of functional and physical decompositions so as              
              to minimize the area and maximize the performance (or find a trade             
              off between the two).  Algorithms to decompose a sequential circuit            
              into a set of interacting synchronous finite state machines (FSM's)            
              are being investigated.  The approach is to find a set of                      
              generalized partitions of machine states, so that each machine                 
              state can be implemented as a separate machine.  The machines                  
              corresponding to those partitions interact with each other in a                
              more complex fashion than those derived on the basis of classical              
              theory of closed partitions.  For example, in this organization one            
              machine may depend on other machines by using their state bits as              
              primary inputs.
