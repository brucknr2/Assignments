Abstract    :
                   Research will be carried out in photonuclear physics at                   
              the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)/LEGS facility, at The                 
              Svedberg (cyclotron) Laboratory (TSI) in Sweden, and at the                    
              CEBAF laboratory.  The principal focus will be on experiments                  
              which probe multinucleon exchange currents.  Linearly polarized                
              and monoenergetic high energy gammas will be used in exclusive                 
              three-body breakup of He-3 at BNL.  High resolution proton                     
              capture reactions at TSI will be used to explore many body                     
              currents in complex nuclei.  For CEBAF activities, design and                  
              construction of Cerenkov detectors for proposed experiments                    
              with the large acceptance spectrometer will be undertaken.
