Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fireflies emit bioluminescent light signals for visual                         
              communication.  Since the light emitted is dim, the visual system              
              of fireflies offers a model for investigating how to optimize                  
              detection of low-intensity optical signals.  Work to date has                  
              allowed proposing an optimization model for the colors of firefly              
              bioluminescence, based largely on the sensitivity of the eyes of               
              different species for light of different colors, or spectral                   
              sensitivity.  This project will investigate how some                           
              neurophysiological mechanisms can optimize functioning in                      
              ecological settings called "photic niches" at times related to                 
              ambient light levels, such as dusk versus late night.  Studies                 
              will examine if visual sensitivity and flashing rhythm may change              
              with time of day, if the spectral sensitivity of the                           
              photoreceptors is different in different parts of the compound                 
              eye, and what particular role the different photopigments in the               
              cells of the eye play in modifying the photoreceptor responses.                
              This project is a model multidisciplinary approach to                          
              understanding how a sensory system has become adapted in response              
              to evolutionary selection pressure on both the signalling system               
              and the receiver.  Results will bear on ecological and                         
              evolutionary biology, on insect science and animal behavior, as                
              well as neuroscience.  The research environment will provide                   
              excellent opportunities for training students, particularly                    
              minorities, in current neuroscience.
