Abstract    :
              This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface                   
              chemistry and in the subfield of solid state nuclear magnetic                  
              resonance studies of catalytic surface chemistry.  Professor                   
              Cecil Dybowski will study the adsorption of Xe gas on zeolite                  
              materials using solid state NMR methods.  By determining the                   
              fundamental phenomena which give rise to chemical shifts and                   
              changes in peak shape, the use of the Xe adsorption method to                  
              probe surface chemistry will be advanced.                                      
                                                                                             
              Microporous zeolites with particular surface chemistries will                  
              be used to probe both chemical shift and dynamic relaxation of                 
              Xe nuclear magnetic resonances.  Using diffusion measurements,                 
              the role of surface oxide structure on relaxation times will be                
              determined.  This will lead to a better understanding of the                   
              chemistry of adsorption.
