Abstract    :
              Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) Spectroscopy is the primary                      
              technique for studying molecules which contain unpaired                        
              electrons.  An ESR spectrometer is useful in areas such as                     
              solid state chemistry, surface chemistry, solid state physics,                 
              electrochemistry, and material science.                                        
                                                                                             
              The Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin at                  
              Madison will use this award from the Chemical Research                         
              Instrumentation Program to help acquire a state-of-the-art                     
              Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)/Spectrometer.  The areas of                      
              chemical research that will enhance by the acquisition include                 
              the following:
