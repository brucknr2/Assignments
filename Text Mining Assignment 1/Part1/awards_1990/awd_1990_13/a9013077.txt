Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for an IUTAM Symposium on                  
              Inelastic Deformation of Composite Materials to be held at                     
              Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in May 1990.  A number of topics              
              will be discussed in which leaders in composites have been invited             
              and agreed to participate.
