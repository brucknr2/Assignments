Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Only two hydrothermal systems -- TAG and Snakepit -- are known                 
              to be active on the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  Dr.                    
              Thompson participated on a large diving program to both sites                  
              last winter;  the present award provides he and his colleagues                 
              Drs. Humphris and Tivey with funds to analyze and interpret the                
              samples collected on both this most recent expedition and ones                 
              from earlier sampling programs.  Objectives are to: 1) map the                 
              vent sites in detail;  2) determine the nature, origin and                     
              time/space processes of mineralization;  3) compare the                        
              evolution of the two sites using both observations and models;                 
              4) determine chemical exchanges that occur during supergene                    
              alterations;  5) estimate the significance of these deposits to                
              global geochemical budgets and cycles;  and 6) assess the                      
              economic significance of the sulfide deposits.
