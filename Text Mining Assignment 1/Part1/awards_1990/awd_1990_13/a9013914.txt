Abstract    :
              The political process has legal, constitutional, and social                    
              components which need to be understood.  My research topic is the              
              process by which the White House through the Executive Office of               
              the President, relates to the main actors in the legislative                   
              process: Congress and interest groups.  Specifically, I seek to                
              explicate the underlying assumptions that these main players share,            
              which enable the process to work (however badly).  Also, I will try            
              to assess these assumptions and compare them to an older                       
              understanding of the policy-making process that has closer ties to             
              constitutional principles.
