Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) is an                          
              independent, nonprofit field station with mo institutional                     
              affiliation, which provides facilities for researchers who wish                
              to study high-altitude biology in a field setting.  Researchers                
              have come to the RMBL for six decades, and during that time have               
              patiently put up with exceedingly inadequate housing.  Recent                  
              facilities grants from the NSF have assisted with new cabin                    
              construction.  This proposal will provide funds for renovation of              
              three existing researcher cabins.  One of these is an historic                 
              structure 112 years old, and improvements at this stage will                   
              prolong their useful life for at least another three decades.
