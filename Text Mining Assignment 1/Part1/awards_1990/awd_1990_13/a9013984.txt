Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI proposes a theoretical study of the large scale and slow                
              dynamics of spatially extended non-equilibrium systems.  Two                   
              classes of model systems will be investigated: 1. one and two                  
              dimensional lattices of discrete chaotic elements or oscillators               
              with dynamics preserving a conserved quantity or having an internal            
              symmetry; 2. two dimensional fluid flow.  Numerical simulation,                
              Monte Carlo methods, mean field theory, and renormalization group              
              methods will be used.
