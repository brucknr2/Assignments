Abstract    :
                   Neutron activation analysis will be used to determine the                 
              concentrations of selected trace elements in atmospheric samples               
              from the AEROCE sites.  Aerosol particle samples are collected                 
              daily at Bermuda, Barbados, Tenerife, and Ireland, and the                     
              concentrations of up to twenty-five elements will be determined                
              in each.  The chemical analyses provide information on three                   
              general classes of trace constituents:  mineral aerosol,                       
              atmospheric sea salt, and a variety of enriched elements.  The                 
              objectives of the study are 1) to develop a chemical climatology               
              for trace elements in aerosol particles over the North Atlantic,               
              2) to identify the sources for the trace elements, 3) to evaluate              
              the export of mineral aerosol and atmospheric pollutants from the              
              continents to the North Atlantic region, 4) to characterize the                
              relationships among various classes of particulate trace                       
              substances in the atmosphere, 5) to investigate the mechanisms                 
              involved in the atmospheric deposition process and to improve                  
              estimates of the air/sea exchange rates for trace elements, 6) to              
              evaluate the role of air/sea exchange in the biogeochemical                    
              cycling of trace elements in the ocean, and 7) to ascertain the                
              impacts of particulate trace elements on physical properties of                
              the atmosphere.
