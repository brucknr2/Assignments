Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The sense of touch allows discrimination of texture and spatial                
              properties of objects, in addition to conveying timing                         
              information on properties such as vibration to the brain.  One                 
              class of mechanoreceptor in mammals shows a slowly adapting                    
              response to deformation; are called T1 or SA 1 receptors and                   
              are found in small domed structures under the skin.  These                     
              domes are contacted by terminals of single nerve cells that                    
              carry the signal to the brain.  There may be more than one site                
              where responses are generated in such neurons, so that each                    
              neuron may have several nearby zones of maximal touch                          
              sensitivity, to allow sophisticated spatial and temporal                       
              processing.  This project combines engineering and biological                  
              techniques and modelling to examine the physiological responses                
              from these receptor organs, using a novel stimulus technology.                 
              The emphasis will be on understanding the temporal, spatial,                   
              and mechanical aspects of interactions between response                        
              generator sites.  Results will be incorporated and compared to                 
              numerical models, to clarify possible mechanisms for encoding                  
              the signals, for the brain to use in tactile discrimination.                   
              This novel approach will provide needed data on the role of                    
              micromechanics and spatial integration on touch, and will have                 
              impact on neuroscience studies of sensory coding, and on                       
              engineering aspects of artificial tactile sensors for robotics.
