Abstract    :
              A compact CO2-CH3F laser system consisting of a millimeter-wave                
              resonator inserted in a three-mirror CO2 laser cavity with an                  
              optically-switched semiconductor cavity-dumper, will be tested.  The           
              cavity-dumped oscillator is expected to be characterized by                    
              predominantly single longitudinal mode, narrow linewidth operation at          
              1.207mm.  It should produce peak powers of order 100kw in pulses of            
              order 10ns duration.  Such output characteristics will prove useful            
              for new experiments involving the resonant excitation by                       
              electromagnetic waves of transverse acoustic (TA) waves in                     
              semiconductor superlattices.  Coherent, monochromatic TA phonons can           
              be generated in GaAs sawtooth-doping superlattices consisting of               
              periodic alternating n- and p-type doped sheets, when the phonon               
              wavevector k is an odd multiple of 2n/d (d = superlattice period) at           
              the resonant frequency w=vk, where v is the TA sound velocity.
