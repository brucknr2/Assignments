Abstract    :
              The principle objective of this project is to support the                      
              distribution of GENESIS, the GEneral NEural Simulation System                  
              developed over the last several years in Professor Bower's                     
              laboratory.  In particular the objective is to establish and                   
              maintain the necessary hardware, software and personnel to                     
              support offsite users of the GENESIS system.                                   
                                                                                             
              The support of offsite users encompasses several areas.                        
              First, standard software support will be provided, including                   
              access to new versions of GENESIS, existing documentation of                   
              both the simulator and specific simulations developed using                    
              it, and comprehensive user "bug" reports as they are reported.                 
              In addition to supplying the basic GENESIS system to offsite                   
              users, Professor Bower and his staff will also provide a                       
              centralized source through which both bug fixes and extensions                 
              to the GENESIS platform can be distributed.  They intend also                  
              to establish a centralized site through which researchers will                 
              be able to communicate interactively in developing                             
              simulations.  Finally, due to the modular structure of the                     
              simulator and its component parts, they will establish a                       
              central site through which new computationally interesting                     
              models, simulator graphical tools and basic simulator                          
              "elements" can be shared and distributed by GENESIS users.
