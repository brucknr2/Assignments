Abstract    :
              The essential objective of this proposed project is to develop a               
              method for the multiobjective optimization on nondeterministic                 
              structural systems under serviceability, ultimate and residual                 
              reliability requirements imposed simultaneously.                               
                                                                                             
              State-of-the-art optimization and structural reliability methods               
              will be used in this research.  Efficient and effective techniques             
              of combining multiobjective mathematical programming with system               
              reliability requirements will be developed and a decision support              
              space will be proposed.  Procedures for risk-based making in a                 
              multiobjective framework will also be developed.
