Abstract    :
                   It is planned to study high energy phenomena on the sun                   
              using microwave data from the Owen's Valley Solar Array (OVRO).                
              Improved imaging capability approaching that of a subarrayed VLA,              
              will also be available when the array is expanded to 5 elements                
              in the near future.  The many frequencies observed at OVRO also                
              permit the use of frequency synthesis, a technique for utilizing               
              the full spatial information available in the data.  Research                  
              will be focussed on mapping and determination of brightness                    
              temperature spectra of solar flares, on determination of the                   
              position and nature of millisecond bursts, on mapping of active                
              region brightness temperatures as a function of frequency, on VLA              
              observations, and on analysis of data already in hand. OVRO will               
              be an active and important participant in the Max'91 Program by                
              operating during the current solar maximum.  Outside users will                
              also be invited to make use of the facility and the acquired                   
              data.  ***
