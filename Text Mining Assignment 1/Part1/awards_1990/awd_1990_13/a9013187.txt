Abstract    :
                   The Dauphin Island Sea Laboratory (DISL) is a coastal                     
              facility of the Marine Environmental Science Consortium,                       
              comprising 21 colleges and universities in Alabama.  The Lab has               
              a growing complement of resident scientists, and an excellent                  
              record of hosting visiting researchers.  Dr. John Pennock, a                   
              senior scientist at DISL, requests support for purchase of a                   
              scintillation counter.  This piece of equipment analyzes the                   
              concentration of radioactive tracers, allowing measurement of                  
              rates of movement and metabolism of organic matter in ecological               
              systems.                                                                       
                   The requested equipment will be made available to resident                
              and visiting scientific staff at DISL.  This instrument will                   
              support a diverse array of biological research projects, and will              
              encourage future investigators to use the growing facilities at                
              DISL.
