Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two tasks will be completed to advance the understanding of                    
              circulation over the continental shelf and slope; data                         
              assimilation studies for the CODE II experiment using the                      
              Princeton/Dynalysis primitive equation formulation and continued               
              research and development of intermediate models including                      
              comparisons with the Haidvogel model.
