Abstract    :
                   This observational program in precision solar photometry at               
              the Big Bear Solar Observatory will make use of a unique,                      
              special-purpose solar disc photometer. A new instrument called                 
              the solar disc photometer has recently been installed at the Big               
              Bear Solar Observatory.  This instrument is capable of obtaining               
              precise relative photometric measurements across the solar                     
              distance with an accuracy of one part in 10,000.  The proposed                 
              research would analyze past data obtained with this instrument in              
              comparison with those obtained by the now defunct ACRIM aboard                 
              the SMM satellite, and take data with an upgraded version of the               
              instrument through the current solar maximum period.  Expected                 
              benefits include: 1) a better understanding of the solar cycle                 
              solar constant variations, as would be gained by detailed                      
              measurements of the contribution from faculae, etc.; 2) observing              
              the polar magnetic field via a quantitative observation of polar               
              faculae; 3) possibly observing a thermal signature of global                   
              solar convection.  ***
