Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  La Selva Biological Station, a lowland tropical rain forest               
              site in Costa Rica, is playing a pivotal role in the United                    
              States` effort to understand and help conserve the rapidly                     
              disappearing ecosystems of the world's wet tropics.  The station               
              combines advanced analytical lab facilities with an unrivaled                  
              spectrum of habitats, including large areas available for                      
              experimental studies.  Findings from the last two decades make La              
              Selva one of the best understood tropical sites worldwide.  As                 
              the station has offered increasing support to scientists,                      
              research has intensified and diversified dramatically - extending              
              from a strong base of systematics and evolutionary ecology into                
              ecosystem studies, physiological ecology, soil science, molecular              
              biology, and atmospheric chemistry.  La Selva is now poised to                 
              support key work in important areas such as global change, land                
              use in the tropics, and biodiversity.                                          
                                                                                             
                   This project is to create complementary resources to greatly              
              increase La Selva`s ability to advance tropical science.  An                   
              integrated database management and geographic information system               
              will unite and make available the wealth of information from past              
              and ongoing studies.  This will be an intellectual research                    
              catalyst of the highest order.
