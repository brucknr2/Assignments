Abstract    :
              One of the roles theoretical computer science is to develop an                 
              algorithmic theory for various application domains.  This                      
              research is motivated by some practical problems in computer                   
              vision and molecular biology.  The main motivating problem in                  
              computer vision is that of searching aerial or satellite                       
              photographs.  In this investigation, the problem is abstracted to              
              several "pure" subproblems  - local errors, scaling, and                       
              rotations - and efficient solutions are sought.  The research                  
              then attempts to synthesize the subproblem solutions and obtain a              
              general algorithm.  The tools for the solution involve techniques              
              that give rise to more general algorithmic and data structure                  
              problems.  This research also addresses problems stemming from                 
              molecular biology.  Recently, several researchers presented                    
              efficient dynamic programming methods for determining the RNA                  
              secondary structure.  New information shows that the secondary                 
              structure is more involved than originally thought.  The                       
              researchers are investigating whether the problem is now NP-                   
              hard.  The answer to that question will determine if efficient                 
              algorithms or efficient approximations to its solution will be                 
              sought.
