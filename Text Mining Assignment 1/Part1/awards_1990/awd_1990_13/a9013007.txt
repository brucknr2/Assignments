Abstract    :
              A large number of biotechnology processes depend either                        
              directly or indirectly on the physical and chemical                            
              properties of cell surfaces.  The aim of this research is                      
              to develop a new technology called cell surface                                
              engineering.                                                                   
              This can be defined as the manipulation of cellular                            
              surfaces                                                                       
              and their exploitation for practical applications.                             
              Recombinant DNA techniques are to be employed to coat                          
              cells                                                                          
              with desired receptor proteins and enzymes.  Potential                         
              applications include the production of inexpensive                             
              cellular                                                                       
              adsorbents suitable for a wide range of affinity                               
              purifications, the development of multipurpose bacterial                       
              vaccines, enzyme immobilization, cell adherence on                             
              surfaces,                                                                      
              and controlled biofilm formation for the prevention of                         
              biofouling/bacterial corrosion.
