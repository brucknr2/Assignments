Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor V. Klee                     
              to work in combinatorics, optimization, and computational                      
              geometry.  He intends to work on higher dimensional                            
              computational geometry, the d-step conjecture in linear                        
              programming and qualitative analysis of linear systems.                        
                   The research falls cross lines between the areas of                       
              combinatorics, optimization theory and computational                           
              geometry.  Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods                    
              to study how discrete collections of objects can be organized.                 
              And, so it is extremely important to modern communications.                    
              Optimization theory, first came to prominence in World                         
              War II, when the theory of linear programming was used so                      
              successfully.  Computational geometry is fundamental to                        
              areas as diverse as CAD/CAM modelling and Robotics.
