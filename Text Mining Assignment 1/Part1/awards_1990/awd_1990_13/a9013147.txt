Abstract    :
              This instrumentation development project will develop new                      
              hardware for enhancing and modifying a Mackereth coring                        
              device for use in water depth from 20 to 6,000 meters.  The                    
              design will allow recovery of large diameter (12.7cm),                         
              precisely oriented, and undisturbed 10-meter sediment cores.                   
              The new deep-water corer will have significant advantages                      
              over presently used piston corers and will have application                    
              in a variety of ocean science research applications.
