Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an investigation of the systematics of                            
              sedimentary sequence formation at Atlantic type margins; that is,              
              the relationship between sea level change and sedimentary record               
              at a subsiding basin margin. The goal is to be able to                         
              interpret seismically measured or determined sedimentary                       
              sequences in terms of: (1) correlatability with like sequences                 
              elsewhere and with a eustatic sea level curve, (2) improved                    
              determination of the amplitudes of eustatic sea level change, and              
              (3) interpretation of sequences in terms of depositional                       
              environments. This modeling and analysis effort will consists of               
              numerical modeling of sequences, analysis of the present day                   
              Pleistocene sedimentary and geomorphologic processes that are                  
              responding to glacioeustatic signals, and backstripping and                    
              reconstruction of the morphology of the Miocene sequences of the               
              New Jersey shelf.
