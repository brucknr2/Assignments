Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will underwrite the construction of additional                    
              housing for scientists near the main laboratory at the University              
              of Minnesota Cedar Creek Natural History Area (CCNHA).  "Pre-                  
              built" units will be used to eliminate most of the                             
              University-mandated costs of planning for new construction.  The               
              accommodations meet local building codes and to provide handicap               
              access.  The support includes funds for housing, site                          
              preparation, electric utilities, well, septic system and complete              
              furnishings.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              These new accommodations are required to meet the demand imposed               
              by an ever increasing group of researcher at CCNHA.  The                       
              research being performed at CCNHA has expanded greatly                         
              assistants, 18 graduate students, 9 post-doctoral researchers,                 
              and 19 faculty from other institutions working at Cedar Creek.                 
              Almost all of these require on-site housing because it allows                  
              them to more easily complete their research and be more a part of              
              the Cedar Creek intellectual community.  In addition, 21 UM                    
              faculty, the data manager, the site manager, and the chemist will              
              be working at Cedar Creek, but will not require housing.
