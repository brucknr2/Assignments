Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research project will support a student of                   
              cultural anthropology from Southern Methodist University in a                  
              field study of the informal economy in Martinique, French West                 
              Indies.  The project will document the importance of informal                  
              sector income-producing activities by interviewing a sample of                 
              households, in a poorer as well as a middle class neighborhood,                
              about the full range of their economic activities. In addition                 
              to conducting participant observation in the neighborhoods,                    
              social networks and life histories will be studied to put the                  
              information about informal sector activities into context of the               
              lives of the people.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the informal economy is a                   
              significant part of all societies, yet by definition is difficult              
              to measure.  Increased understanding of the informal economic                  
              activities of families across the socio-economic spectrum can                  
              help planners adjust policies to the actual situation in society,              
              as opposed to the easily measured situation.
