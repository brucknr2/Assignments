Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr.                       
              Hanley's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support                 
              of his research at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The                  
              thrust of Dr. Hanley's research is the use of sophisticated                    
              surface spectroscopies to examine the energetic                                
              particle-surface interaction.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The experiments will investigate chemical reactions of                         
              molecules on surfaces induced by energetic ion and atom                        
              bombardment. Vibrational and other non-destructive surface                     
              spectroscopies will be used to correlate bombardment induced                   
              surface reactions with molecular mass spectra observed by                      
              secondary ion, secondary neutral and fast bombardment mass                     
              spectrometry.  These experiments will be performed on models of                
              adsorbate-covered surfaces, organic solids, and multicomponent                 
              surfaces formed by vapor deposition on single crystal surfaces                 
              under ultrahigh vacuum conditions.  The role of projectile                     
              charge state and chemistry will also be examined. These                        
              experiments will attempt to determine the basic physical                       
              processes leading to ejection of secondary molecular ions and                  
              neutrals ultimately leading to an improved interpretation of                   
              mass spectra of real systems typically probed by energetic                     
              particle bombardment.
