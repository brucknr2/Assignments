Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Continental Scientific Drilling is an essential activity of               
              programs within the DOE, NSF, and USGS.  The present U.S.                      
              Continental Scientific Drilling Program consists of a coordinated              
              set of these activities that is also consistent with the missions              
              of each agency.  Because the programs of the participating                     
              agencies are related in scientific interests, a coordinated                    
              interagency effort in continental scientific drilling is both                  
              cost effective and highly beneficial.  The Interagency                         
              Coordinating Group for Continental Scientific Drilling (ICG),                  
              formally in existence since the signing of the Interagency Accord              
              on Continental Scientific Drilling in 1984, provides this                      
              coordination.                                                                  
                                                                                             
                   This action provides funds in the form of an interagency                  
              transfer to the USGS to cover NSF's share of ICG expenses (Annual              
              Report to Congress, ICG staff, workshop reports, etc.).                        
              Specifically, these funds will be used to pay NSF's share of                   
              expenses related to the Environmental Impact Statement for the                 
              Katmai Scientific Drilling Project which is being coordinated for              
              the ICG by the USGS.
