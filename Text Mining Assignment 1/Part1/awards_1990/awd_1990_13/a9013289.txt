Abstract    :
              This is a study of polymer membrane formation by the phase                     
              inversion technique to which will focus on the development of                  
                                                                                             
              quantitative models to describe the structure forming                          
              processes.  A number of model polymer/solvent/nonsolvent                       
              systems will be used to investigate the role of glass                          
              transition,liquid-liquid phase separation, and crystallization                 
                                                                                             
              prior to and following film precipitation.  Film morphology                    
              will also be studied using scanning electron microscopy.                       
              Together with results from the mass transfer experiments,                      
              these will be analyzed in terms of models developed for the                    
              nonsolvent-solvent exchange process.  Results from these                       
              studies will have direct application in the field of membrane                  
                                                                                             
              processing and will also find application in a number of other                 
                                                                                             
              important technological processes which involve polymer phase                  
                                                                                             
              transformation under nonequilibrium quench conditions.
