Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The timing and site(s) of appearance of modern humans is of                    
              central interest to physical anthropologists.  This research                   
              seeks to help clarify the relationships of sub-Saharan                         
              populations through the analysis of dental traits.  As many                    
              recent theories postualte a recent, African origin for our                     
              species, clarification of population relationships on this                     
              continent are a key aspect of resolving the larger question.                   
                                                                                             
              Lately, much research has utilized nucleic acid technology to                  
              seek answers to these questions, but not without challenge.  For               
              instance, some of the results appear to be at odds with                        
              archaeological evidence.  The dentition evidences a number of                  
              independent, genetic traits which can be used to help clarig=fy                
              population relationships.  To date, however, the dental                        
              anthropology of African poulations has been minimal.  The                      
              proposed study will involve the scoring of a sizable number of                 
              human, African dentitions which are housed in several museums.  A              
              number of computer algorithms can be used to assess similarities               
              between populations, both within Africa and in contrast to non-                
              African groups for which data already exists.                                  
              By such techniques a clearer picture of human movements and                    
              evolution should emerge.
