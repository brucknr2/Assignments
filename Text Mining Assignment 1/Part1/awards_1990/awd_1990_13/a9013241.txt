Abstract    :
                   One of the key scientific issues of contemporary                          
              magnetospheric physics is to elucidate the processes that are                  
              responsible for particle acceleration in the auroral region.                   
              Acceleration of the particles along a magnetic field requires the              
              action of an electric field which can either be an extended                    
              structure or confined to a shock-like structure in a narrow                    
              region called a double layer.  This grant is to extend previous                
              laboratory investigations of ion acoustic double layers to a                   
              plasma parameter regime that is useful for understanding auroral               
              particle acceleration.  The experiments consist of creating a                  
              series of ion acoustic double layers in a long magnetized plasma               
              column and studying the acceleration of both ambient and test                  
              particles across them.
