Abstract    :
                   Today imaging scientists are developing displays of images in              
                3-D, combining several imaging modalities interactively,                    
              conducting research involving computationally intensive solutions              
              to problems such as studies of ultrasound tissue characterization,             
              and transmitting image, data, and audio signals in networks at the             
              local and regional levels.                                                     
                   A description and demonstration of the NSFNET capabilities and            
              how research in the radiological imaging sciences would be enhanced            
              through access to this growing high speed, wide area, computer                 
              network will be discussed at a two day workshop at the University              
              of Illinois.  The meeting is to be organized by the American                   
              College of Radiology in conjunction with the National Center for               
              Computing Applications (NCSA) at the University.
