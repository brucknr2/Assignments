Abstract    :
              Funds are to be used to support graduate students                              
              attending the IV. Symposium on Quantum 1/f Noise                               
              and Other Low Frequency Fluctuations in Electronic                             
              Devices, organized by Dr. A an der Ziel and myself                             
              at the University of Minnesota, in the Coffman                                 
              Union Building, Minneapolis, MN, on May 10-11,                                 
              1990. Like the previous symposia in October 1985,                              
              October 1986, and April 1988, this conference will                             
              bring together researchers from universities,                                  
              industrial and governmental research laboratories,                             
              and the industry, working in the field of Quantum 1/f                          
              Noise and other low frequency fluctuations. This                               
              Symposium focuses on the description of the present                            
              state and of the research directions in the field of                           
              Quantum 1/f Noise, although other low frequency                                
              fluctuations are also included (as in 1988), in order to                       
              widen the scope of the Symposium and the pool of                               
              participants.
