Abstract    :
              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the                
              research of Dr. Eric J. Enholm of the Department of Chemistry                  
              at the University of Florida.  Dr. Enholm's research is in the                 
              broad area of the development of new synthetic methodology                     
              which can then be applied to a variety of total syntheses.  The                
              specific goals of the proposed studies are to study synthetic                  
              applications of various one-electron coupling reactions of two                 
              unsaturated centers which lead to carbon-carbon bond formation.                
                                                                                             
              Dr. Enholm will focus his efforts on carbonyl-alkene                           
              cyclization, the preparation of carbocycles from carbohydrates,                
              the coupling of dicarbonyl compounds and a newly developed free                
              radical coupling reaction mediated by tributyltin hydride.                     
              Targets projected for eventual total synthesis include the                     
              natural products anguidine, tricotriol and tylonide hemiacetal.
