Abstract    :
              This research is using the combinatorial optimization capabilities             
              of neural networks to devise algorithms for solving repair problems            
              in IC chips.  Two classes of array repair problems are being                   
              examined.  The first is repair by replacement of rows and columns              
              (as in memory arrays).  The second is repair by replacement of                 
              individual cells (as in systolic arrays and iterative logic).                  
              Theoretical models of array repair problems are being analyzed and             
              simulated to measure the performance of neural repair algorithms.              
              Electronic neural networks that will execute the neural repair                 
              algorithms for memory, systolic and iterative arrays are being                 
              designed and fabricated.
