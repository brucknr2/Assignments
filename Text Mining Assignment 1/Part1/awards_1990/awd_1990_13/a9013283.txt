Abstract    :
              The extraordinary events now unfolding in Eastern Europe offer a               
              unique opportunity to investigate how the tensions between                     
              socialism and utopian ideology on the one hand and the rule of law             
              and protection of individual rights on the other hand will be                  
              resolved in the context of current legal reforms in East and West              
              Germany.  With German reunification, the East German legal                     
              institutions, lawyers, and citizens will have to adjust to a legal             
              system fundamentally different from the one they have known for the            
              last forty years.                                                              
                                                                                             
              This small award will provide travel and subsistence support for               
              the investigator to gather data in East and West Germany in order              
              to examine what influence socialist concepts and thought patterns              
              exert over the East German legal reform process.  The data                     
              collection will focus on two specific legal contexts: the judicial             
              review of administrative decisionmaking and the allocation of                  
              visitation rights to non-custodial parents upon divorce.  Data will            
              be collected from court observations, court records, interviews,               
              and analysis of the literature.                                                
                                                                                             
              This support will allow the investigator to take advantage of                  
              history in the making in the unification of East and West Germany.             
              The results of this effort will provide valuable information for               
              further analyses of East German legal reform efforts and will be               
              informative in other countries which are struggling with the                   
              contradiction between the desire for social cohesion and the                   
              respect for individual rights and autonomy.
