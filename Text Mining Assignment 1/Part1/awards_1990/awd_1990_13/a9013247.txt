Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is on model-based image sequence                    
              estimation and restoration and implementation using multi-                     
              processing.  The image estimation is achieved using extended                   
              reduced order model Kalman filter and estimates of displacement                
              parameters.  Simulated annealing type algorithms are explored in               
              solving the resulting estimation problem.  The restoration is                  
              achieved by the incorporation of velocity constraints explicitly               
              into the 3D space-time model.  Finally, the algorithms are                     
              implemented on massively parallel computers such as DAP and MASPAR             
              configured as a linear array.
