Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to develop a working experimental                
              understanding of photopolymerization processes initiated with                  
              visible light initiators and using visible lasers.  The principal              
              application of interest is three-dimensional imaging:  using a                 
              laser to control the formation of contour or a shape.  Thus, a                 
              target of the work is to understand, eventually, the formation of              
              shapes from crosslinked gels and to understand how                             
              photopolymerization rates effect the dimensions.  Another goal is              
              to expand studies of photochemical polymerization processes to                 
              systems that can be used to unique advantage in altering or                    
              controlling the outcome of a chain reaction, such as under harsh               
              conditions.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The specific goals for this research are:                                      
                                                                                             
              1)  To optimize initiators which function at 488 nm, 514 nm, 632               
              nm and > 720 nm and cause controlled polymerization "at depth".                
                                                                                             
              2)  To optimize dimensional control in laser initiated acrylate                
              photopolymerization, and develop techniques which form contours.               
                                                                                             
              3)  To develop time-resolved photopolymerization experiments such              
              that the rates of photopolymerizations can be evaluated as a                   
              function of initiator, monomer, light source, in the dimension Z.              
                                                                                             
              4)  To optimize property control and photospeed in laser-                      
              initiated acrylate photopolymerization.                                        
                                                                                             
              5)  To develop techniques for the formation of composite                       
              materials using laser-initiated acrylate photopolymerization.                  
                                                                                             
              6)  To develop techniques for the formation of composites and                  
              polymers by laser-initiated polymerization under harsh                         
              conditions.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              7)  To develop monomer systems, other than acrylates, that can be              
              efficiently photopolymerized with visible lasers.
