Abstract    :
              Theoretical modeling will be used in research on three aspects                 
              of thin film dynamics:  surface tension/elastic instabilities                  
              in thin flexible tubes, spreading and chemical transport from                  
              small droplets on thin films, and frontal surfactant spreading                 
              and transport. The research is motivated by biomechanical                      
              issues related to the lung, namely the stability of small                      
              airways and the delivery of medications by aerosols.                           
                                                                                             
              The research is also applicable to surfactant effects in                       
              industrial thin films and the micropores of porous media,                      
              particularly poroelastic materials.
