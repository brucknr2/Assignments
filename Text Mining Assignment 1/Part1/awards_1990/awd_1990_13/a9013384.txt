Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of mass spectrometry.  Professor                 
              David Laude will study the means to manipulate the packet of                   
              ions which cycle in ion cyclotron resonance.  Dynamic trapping                 
              techniques will be used to control the kinetic energy                          
              distributions of ions within the cyclotron cell.  This leads to                
              improvement of resolution and high mass detection in Fourier                   
              transform mass spectrometry (FTMS).  Further work with the                     
              improved detection system will focus on design and construction                
              of a fiber optic interface for laser desorption FTMS.                          
              Suspended trapping techniques will be used to control the                      
              concentration of neutral species within the cyclotron cell.                    
                                                                                             
              This research will have impact on the coupling of                              
              chromatographic streams to the FTMS enabling direct analysis of                
              very complex mixtures.
