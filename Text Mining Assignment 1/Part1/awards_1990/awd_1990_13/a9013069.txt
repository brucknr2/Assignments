Abstract    :
              The proposed research seeks to investigate how people use graphic              
              information in making judgments and decisions.  Research on human              
              judgment has become increasingly concerned with the compatibility              
              between the manner in which information is portrayed and the                   
              associated information processing strategies invoked in making a               
              decision.  However, relatively little is known about the effects               
              of information display on decision making.                                     
                                                                                             
              The two basic concepts behind the research are the lens model                  
              paradigm and the compatibility hypothesis.  The plan of the                    
              research is to undertake a series of empirical studies to examine              
              compatibility effects between the form of the graphic information              
              display and the context of the judgment tasks.  The lens model                 
              framework is used to conceptualize the relationship between human              
              judgmental processes and the elements or cues in the stimulus                  
              environment.  Graphic displays will be constructed using varying               
              display characteristics.  An important task variable to be studied             
              is time pressure.  The research will advance both the development              
              of descriptive theory of human decision behavior and the                       
              development of decision aids to improve decision making.
