Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Present Massively Parallel Computers (MPCs) have been used as stand            
              alone single user systems with a batch job interface.  However, the            
              next generation will be sufficiently powerful that time shared                 
              control systems will be required to support multiple users and                 
              minimize loss of CPU cycles.  For MPCs with Multiple Instruction               
              Multiple Data (MIMD) architectures, the dynamics scheduling of                 
              clusters of CPUs can allow effective use without idling CPUs from              
              lack of work.  A dynamic job mix control system will be developed              
              which will optimize job throughput by maximizing the number of CPUs            
              assigned to jobs.
