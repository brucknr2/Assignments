Abstract    :
                   This proposal covers two types of activities: 1) the                      
              management of the AEROCE scientific program; 2) the management of              
              operations at the Secondary Network stations at Barbados and                   
              Izania.                                                                        
                   The PI carries out his management duties in his capacity as               
              chairman of the AEROCE Executive Committee which is comprised of               
              three PI's from the AEROCE program.  A Scientific Advisory                     
              Committee (SAC) composed of independent scientists provides                    
              oversight.  The SAC reviews ongoing activities and assesses the                
              future direction of the program. The SAC meets with all PI's at                
              least once a year at the AEROCE annual meeting.                                
                   As Chairman of the Executive Committee, the PI: 1) serves as              
              the spokesperson for AEROCE when dealing with foreign                          
              governments; 2) is the principal liaison with cooperating                      
              research groups; 3) is the primary interface with international                
              programs such as IGAC and JGOPS.                                               
                   The University of Miami (UM) manages the stations in the                  
              Secondary Network.  At present, the UM is operating Barbados,                  
              Mace Head and Izania.  As network operator, the UM is responsible              
              for all aspects of maintaining the network station operator, the               
              UM is responsible for all aspects of maintaining the network                   
              station operations.  This includes equipment design, maintenance               
              and repair, maintaining liaison with the station operators,                    
              ensuring QA/QC, distribution samples to other PI's and archiving
