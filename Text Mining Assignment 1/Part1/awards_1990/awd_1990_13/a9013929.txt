Abstract    :
              Waves or oscillations are common in gaseous plasmas.  This                     
              work, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program                
              of the Chemistry Division, seeks to use the dependence of such                 
              oscillations on the chemical makeup of the plasma to detect                    
              assorted chemical species and to quantify them.  Both the                      
              oscillation frequency and amplitude are related to the amount                  
              of analyte present.  The sensitivity of this dependence is                     
              dependent on species structure.                                                
                                                                                             
              Plasmas are generally regarded as tools for studying atomic                    
              species; this work will characterize molecular species in the                  
              plasma instead.  With arrays of sensor cells at different                      
              pressures, it may be possible to establish a fingerprint for                   
              specific compounds or classes of compounds.  Plausible                         
              applications include detection of gas chromatograph effluents,                 
              remote sensing of noxious vapors, and process control.
