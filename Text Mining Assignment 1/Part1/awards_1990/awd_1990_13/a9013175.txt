Abstract    :
              This award will help support a 12 month research visit to the                  
              laboratories of the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute                     
              (JAERI), in collaboration with Dr. Yasuharu Sugiyama.  Dr. Kim will            
              take part in experiments at subbarrier energies which are                      
              tailored to study the earliest phase of heavy-ion reactions                    
              through nuclear interactions.  These experiments should advance                
              our views of interactions between heavy-ions below and near the                
              interaction barrier.  These experiments were conceived and                     
              proposed by the Reaction Dynamics Group of the Oak Ridge National              
              Lab Physics Division and rely on the superb resolving power of                 
              the magnetic spectrometer (ENMA) and the high-quality heavy-ion                
              beams of the JAERI laboratory.
