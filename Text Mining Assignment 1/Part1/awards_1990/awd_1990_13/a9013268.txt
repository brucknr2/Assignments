Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest is a 16,000 acre (6400                   
              hectare) U.S. Forest Service property in the western Oregon                    
              Cascades dedicated to research and education.  It is jointly                   
              administered by Oregon State University (OSU) and the U.S. Forest              
              Service Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNW).  Research use                
              of the Andrews Forest and nearby Research Natural Areas is heavy,              
              with more than 7000 researcher-days of use and over 100 separate               
              projects in each of the last 5 years.  Current overnight capacity              
              is inadequate, however, and threatens to get worse as old, worn                
              out trailers reach the point of condemnation.  Since 1985,                     
              capacity has declined from 54 to 40 and will decrease to 28 in                 
              the next two years unless new space is created.  Quite simply the              
              research site is facing a housing crisis.  This project will help              
              construct two quadruplex dormitories.  OSU has pledged $56,000                 
              and PNW $137,000 for a total of $193,000, a 50/50 match.  The two              
              quads would increase overnight capacity bedrooms, two bathrooms                
              with showers and a kitchen-living area.  Bedrooms (about 100 sq.               
              ft. each) will contain a bed, desk, bookcase, and wardrobe.  The               
              quads will be plain but solid with 6 inch studding, exteriors of               
              T-1-11 siding, drywall panelling, and plywood cabinetwork.  They               
              will also be well insulated with R-19 walls and floors, R-32                   
              ceilings, and double-glazed windows.
