Abstract    :
              The research project combines work on graph embeddings and parallel            
              algorithms to study a variety of emulation problems for processor              
              arrays, i.e., parallel architectures that consist of a communication           
              network having processing elements at each mode.  The research focuses         
              on a variey of theoretical problems that relate to the design,                 
              programming, and implementation of "real" processor arrays.  More              
              specifically, the research problems motivating the research include            
              attempts to:                                                                   
                                                                                             
                 o simplify the programming of a parallel architecture, by allowing          
                   the programmer to specify an algorithm for an idealized                   
                   architecture which is then emulated by an actual architecture;            
                                                                                             
                 o understand the relative communication power of various                    
                   interconnection networks, by determining how efficiently                  
                   arrays based on each of the networks can emulate arrays                   
                   based on the others, on general computations;                             
                                                                                             
                 o achieve fault tolerance, by having an array that has been                 
                   crippled by defects emulate a fault-free version of itself.               
                                                                                             
              The theoretical results obtained in the course of the proposed                 
              research should lend insights into the "real" analogs of the problems          
              studied.
