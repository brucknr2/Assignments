Abstract    :
              This project concerns the complexity of algebraic problems,                    
              concentrating on algorithms for groups and their applications.  A              
              major focus is on the development of fast parallel algorithms, but the         
              innovations that are needed for this also seem applicable to                   
              sequential algorithms.  Another goal is the expansion of the                   
              polynomial-time library, especially via new techniques that utilize            
              building blocks such as composition factors and Sylow subgroups.  A            
              distinguishing feature of the new methods is an expanding involvement          
              of results that have become available only through recent advances in          
              group theory, particularly the classification of finite simple groups.         
              This is the case even for procedures that underlie new approaches to           
              naive issues such as membership testing.  A complementary study                
              focuses on identifying the problems that are likely to remain hard, in         
              either sequential or parallel settings.  Almost all of these studies           
              have implications for the problem of testing graph isomorphism.
