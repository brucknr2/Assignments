Abstract    :
                   Organized collections of thunderstorms known as mesoscale                 
              convective systems have been identified as producers of most of                
              the rainfall in the tropics and in mid-latitudes during the                    
              spring, summer and fall.                                                       
                   The Principal Investigator will continue his research                     
              towards an improved understanding of mesoscale convective systems              
              (MCSs) and the atmospheric boundary layer.  Under previously NSF               
              sponsored research the Principal Investigator produced many                    
              significant new findings.  Among these are the identification of               
              the factors responsible for several distinctive features of MCSs.              
                   This line of research will continue with both observational               
              and numerical modeling components.  Emphasis will be placed on:                
                                                                                             
              1.  The dynamics of a region of low pressure which often trails                
              MCSs, known as "wake lows"                                                     
                                                                                             
              2.  The formation mechanisms of mesoscale vortices which form out              
              of MCSs.  These stable vortices are believed to be a triggering                
              mechanism for future rounds of severe weather several hours after              
              the original MCS has dissipated.                                               
                                                                                             
              3.  The controlling factors for series of MCSs which are often                 
              responsible for severe rain events.                                            
                                                                                             
                   If successful, this research can be used to develop better                
              numerical and conceptual models for the forecasting of severe MCS              
              weather events.
