Abstract    :
                   This grant will support an investigation by a faculty                     
              member of Trinity College of the properties of certain excited                 
              states of 21Na, 22Na, and 23Na by means of the (3He,d) reaction                
              on stable neon isotopes.  The research will lead toward a                      
              better understanding of the capture of protons by neon and the                 
              importance of such reactions in the synthesis of nuclei heavier                
              than those involved in the C-N-O cycle in stellar burning.  The                
              (3He,d) proton transfer reaction will be used to determine the                 
              single-particle strengths of excited states near the proton                    
              threshold.
