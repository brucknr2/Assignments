Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a long-term research stay in Japan                     
              for Thomas M. Cronin, U.S. Geological Survey, to conduct                       
              collaborative research with Noriyuki Ikeya at the Institute                    
              of Geosciences, Shizuoka University, Japan.                                    
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to develop a quantitative                     
              method for the paleoclimatic study of Neogene and Quaternary                   
              marine deposits of Japan and the western North Pacific Ocean.                  
              Building upon a previous Cronin-Ikeya paleoclimatic study                      
              which applied a qualitative analysis of Ostracoda, a small,                    
              bivalved Crustacea which is easily fossilized, this project                    
              will utilize the extensive ostracode collection and water                      
              temperature data which are available at Shizuoka University.                   
              After a quantitative analysis of the ostracode samples at                      
              different water temperatures, the team will employ Dr.                         
              Cronin's methodology to develop a transfer function for the                    
              osctracodes and to derive equations for computing summer and                   
              winter paleotemperatures from Pliocene and Quaternary fossil                   
              ostracode assemblages from the western North Pacific.  The                     
              research results will be applied to measure the climatic                       
              change during the middle Pliocene period.
