Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Research Opportunity Award (ROW) supports a collaborative                 
              effort between Dr. Marilyn Livingston, Professor of Computer                   
              Science at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville and Dr.                
              Nora Sabelli, Senior Research Scientist, at the National Center                
              fort Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at Urbana.  The                        
              collaboration is aimed at increasing the participation of women                
              in science and expanding the computer and computational science                
              components in women's science programs.  One particular goal is                
              the participation of women undergraduate students in a software                
              research development and evaluation project.  These                            
              undergraduate students will also act as mentors to pre-college                 
              women students.
