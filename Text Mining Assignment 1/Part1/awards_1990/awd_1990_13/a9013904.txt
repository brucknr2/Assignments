Abstract    :
              In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Sibert will carry out a set                  
              of fully quantum mechanical calculations of rotation-vibration                 
              states of polyatomic molecules. A knowledge of these states is                 
              necessary to predict the rates of chemical reactions.                          
                                                                                             
              The calculations will encompass a wide range of molecules using                
              both variational and perturbative techniques. The goal of the                  
              calculations is to elucidate the connections between                           
              Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces and the dynamics and                
              spectroscopy, which occurs as a result of motion on these                      
              surfaces. The systems to be treated will include H2O, SO2, HCN,                
              HCCH, NH3, and H2CO. Coordinate and basis set representations                  
              will be developed which facilitate not only the calculation of                 
              spectra given a potential energy surface, but also the inverse,                
              namely, the calculation of potential energy surfaces given the                 
              spectra. The representation chosen to describe the                             
              rotating-vibrating molecules will be specifically designed to                  
              describe certain large amplitude motions for which Jacobi                      
              coordinates are inadequate. An understanding of these                          
              transformations  plays a pivotal role in our ability to                        
              understand and develop theories of reaction rates, reaction                    
              dynamics, collisional energy transfer, and mode specific                       
              effects.
