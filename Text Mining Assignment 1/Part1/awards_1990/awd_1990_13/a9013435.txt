Abstract    :
              This investigation is directed at improving our understanding of               
              the relatively large amplitude interannual-interdecadal climate                
              variability. The study involves: (a) Development of a better                   
              documentation of the nature and causes of the global El Nino-                  
              Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, (b) Use of the NMC analysis                 
              and forecast model output, to develop a better understanding of                
              the processes associated with tropical-extratropical                           
              teleconnections, and (c) Development of a better understanding                 
              and description of low-frequency, large basin-scale                            
              atmospheric-land surface hydrological variations over North                    
              America in general and the Great Plains in particular.                         
                                                                                             
              This investigation will make valuable contributions toward our                 
              ability to distinguish natural climate variability from                        
              anthropogenic climate trends.
