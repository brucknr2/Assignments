Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a proposal to study the structure of bulk and thin film                
              oxide superconductors using perturbed angular correlation (PAC)                
              spectroscopy. The primary objectives of the proposed research are:             
              to determine the site-occupation probabilities of indium in                    
              Yttrium-Barium-Copper-Oxide material as a function of temperature,             
              oxygen concentration, and cation-alloy composition; to determine               
              the nature of the orthorombic/tetragonal phase transition which                
              occurs near 700C; and to provide accurate information about the                
              Yttrium-Barrium-Copper-Oxide phase diagram at high temperatures.               
              Other major objectives are: to study oxygen defect trapping by                 
              indium at low temperatures; and to study oxygen ordered phases at              
              low temperature. These issues are important for the processing of              
              high Tc superconductors.
