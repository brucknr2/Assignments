Abstract    :
              The application of high temperature superconductors (HTSC) in                  
              electronics requires a cost-effective deposition process capable               
              of growing epitaxial, in-situ superconducting thin films below                 
              650oC.  Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) has the                 
              potential to meet this need; however, it is currently limited by               
              the high temperatures required to decompose the intermediates                  
              formed by the decomposition of Group II source reagents.  The                  
              research will provide a fundamental understanding of the barium                
              chemistry occurring at the growth interface which will facilitate              
              the low temperature preparation of HTSC thin films.  If low                    
              growth temperatures can be realized, the development of a                      
              manufacturing process should rapidly follow based on CVD's                     
              inherent advantages in large area uniformity and ease of scale-
