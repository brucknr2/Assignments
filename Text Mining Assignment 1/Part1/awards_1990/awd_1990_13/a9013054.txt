Abstract    :
              The Mexican axolotl is a salamander used as a non-mammalian                    
              vertebrate model system in diverse fields of biological research,              
              including cell biology, developmental genetics, endocrinology,                 
              neurobiology, and physiology.  The axolotl is also used in                     
              classroom exercises by teachers at colleges, high schools and                  
              museums.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This grant supports the Indiana University Axolotl Colony, which               
              has been the major supplier of mutant strains of axolotl to the                
              scientific community since late 50's.  The axolotl center breeds,              
              maintains, and supplies the well-characterized genetic stock of                
              axolotl.  It also publishes newsletters to inform the user                     
              community of the availability of axolotl and interesting scientific            
              findings obtained through the use of axolotl.
