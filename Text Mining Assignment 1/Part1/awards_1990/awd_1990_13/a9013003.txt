Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this travel award is to support a visit at the                  
              University of Alaska, Fairbanks by Dr. Yevgeniy Mishin, Head                   
              of the Ionospheric Laboratory of the Institute of Terrestrial                  
              Magnetism, Ionosphere, and Radio Wave Propagation (IZMIRAN),                   
              to explore the possibility of developing proposals for long-                   
              term cooperation in studies of the magnetospheric cusp.                        
              This is a targeted topic under the general category of Arctic                  
              Research under the Memorandum of Understanding between NSF                     
              and the Soviet Academy of Sciences for basic research                          
              cooperation.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the                    
              United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary                        
              efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest                    
              and competence in the field of basic scientific research on                    
              the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
