Abstract    :
              The Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory has developed a data                 
              access method and associated software environment for sharing                  
              parametric geographical data over a wide-area network.  Data are               
              distributed in the form of 'views', virtual flat tables built                  
              from the contents of the database. The heart of this system is a               
              architecture-independent protocol for communicating both the                   
              schema and contents of views over the network.  Scientists run                 
              software applications on their workstations that make requests to              
              publicly accessible 'view-server' software running on the                      
              computer hosting the database.  View-servers hide the details of               
              the database management system from the scientists, and provide a              
              mechanism by which diverse data stored in many different data                  
              managements systems can be accessed in a uniform manner.  An X-                
              Windows based geographical database browser, several data base                 
              managers and associated view-servers, and a view-server for SQL-               
              based relational database managers are made available (by FTP                  
              file transfer) to non-profit educational institutions and US                   
              Government agencies. //
