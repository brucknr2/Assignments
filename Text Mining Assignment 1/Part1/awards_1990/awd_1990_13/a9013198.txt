Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will enhance the research facilities at the Louis                 
              Calder Center, a 113 acre biological field station of Fordham                  
              University.  Because of its proximity to major metropolitan areas              
              of the northeastern United States, its diverse habitats of the                 
              eastern deciduous fores biome (mature upland and lowland forests,              
              early successional grassland and forests, and lake, pond and                   
              stream habitats) and its laboratory facilities, the Calder Center              
              offers excellent opportunities for ecological research.  The                   
              project is for new instrumentation to acquire long-term weather                
              and microclimate data sets at the Calder Center.  This project                 
              complements other recent expenditures by Fordham University to                 
              enhance the research program at the Calder Center, and is                      
              important for future growth of the program.
