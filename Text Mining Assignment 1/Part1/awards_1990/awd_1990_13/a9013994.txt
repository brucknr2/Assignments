Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The question of how processor scheduling should be done in a                   
              parallel timesharing environment will be investigated.                         
              Scheduling must be balanced between giving parallel applications               
              access to CPUs they require, and maintaining interactivity and                 
              throughput.  An understanding of this conflict requires the                    
              development of a parallel workload characterization.  Since the                
              workload changes nonlinearly, an iterative solution to resolve                 
              this dynamical system problem will be implemented on the Cray Y-               
              MP/864 at SDSC.
