Abstract    :
              Abstract                                                                       
              Gravity data collected by the PI during a SeaMARC II program on the            
              East Pacific Rise, together with data collected during earlier                 
              studies, provide the basis of an ideal gravity survey of an ultra-             
              fast spreading ridge.  The main goal of this renewal proposal is to            
              determine if "bull's eye" gravity lows or other along-axis                     
              variations in the gravity field occur at such ultra-fast spreading             
              rates in the South Pacific.  This study will provide the support               
              for completion of a PhD thesis and complements work done by the                
              student earlier on crustal thinning near Atlantic transform faults.
