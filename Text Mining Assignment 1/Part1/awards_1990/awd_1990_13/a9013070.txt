Abstract    :
              In his recent book, Explaining Science (1988), Professor Giere                 
              argued that theories in science are to be understood as families               
              of models, which are abstract, non-linguistic entities.  He claimed            
              that the relationship between models and the world is to be                    
              understood in terms of similarity.  He also suggested that further             
              understanding of what models are, and how they are used, must come             
              not only from logic or mathematics, but also from work in the                  
              cognitive sciences (Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Psychology,             
              Linguistics, Philosophy, Neuroscience) which is focused on the                 
              general nature of representation.   The goal of this project is to             
              explore,in greater detail, recent work on representation to see to             
              what extent this work might indeed provide both an empirical and               
              theoretical basis for the exploration of his own account of                    
              representation in science.
