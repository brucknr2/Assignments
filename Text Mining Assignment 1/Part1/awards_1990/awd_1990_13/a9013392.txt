Abstract    :
              This work will attempt to better understand the renewal of water               
              in the Central Caribbean Basins by direct measurements of the flow             
              from the Atlantic through the Anegada-Jungfern passage, over the               
              controlling sill into the Caribbean.  Water properties, along with             
              radioactive tracer distributions, will also be measured, both                  
              inside the Caribbean, and in the open Atlantic, in order to                    
              determine residence times and renewal rates.  Theoretical analysis             
              will focus on convective boundary flow dynamics, and their                     
              relation to water mass evolution in a confined basin.
