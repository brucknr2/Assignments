Abstract    :
                   This award enables four independent liberal arts colleges                 
              (Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke and Smith) to connect to NSFNET             
              through a fractional T1 link (one-third T1, approximately 500,000              
              bits per second) to the mid-level network NEARnet, the New England             
              Academic and Research Network.  Access to NSFNET provides the                  
              faculty and students of the four colleges with increased                       
              opportunity for collaboration and use of a wide range of research              
              tools such as supercomputing and shared databases.                             
                   Five Colleges, Inc., consists of the four colleges and the                
              University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  Responsibility for network            
              operations and management is assumed by the computing centers of               
              the participating colleges, each of which has established campus-              
              wide local area networks.  The new connectivity vastly improves the            
              file transfer and remote login capabilities between these four                 
              institutions themselves, and with other institutions.
