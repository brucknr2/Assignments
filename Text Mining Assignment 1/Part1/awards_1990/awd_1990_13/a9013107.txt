Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research will be conducted on a variety of problems in materials               
              science and condensed matter physics utilizing transfer matrix                 
              techniques and numerical analysis.  The common model to these                  
              research areas is the lattice gas model of cooperative systems.                
              The first part of the work will focus on low dimensional systems.              
              The primary emphasis will be on multicomponent absorption in                   
              electrochemical systems.  Structural phase transitions and oxygen              
              ordering in high temperature superconductors will also be studied.             
              The second, more speculative, part of the work will concentrate on             
              developing non-equilibrium transfer matrix techniques for lattice              
              gas models.
