Abstract    :
              This grant supports the national Drosophila Species Resource                   
              Center, at Bowling Green State University.  The Center maintains               
              and distributes approximately 300 species of Drosophila for the                
              research community in the U.S. as well as foreign countries.  The              
              Center also provides other services including identification of                
              specimens, assistance in culturing Drosophila, maintenance of                  
              reference libraries, publication of catalogues of the collection,              
              and support of visiting scientists at the Center.  The Center is               
              considered an invaluable resource to the biological research                   
              community at large as Drosophila is one of the most often used                 
              experimental model systems in modern biology.
