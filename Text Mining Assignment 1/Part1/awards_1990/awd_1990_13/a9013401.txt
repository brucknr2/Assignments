Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Brazil Science and Technology Initiative (STI) award                 
              will support a program planning workshop in the area of partial                
              differential equations.  The purpose of the workshop, organized                
              by Professor Paul Rabinowitz of the University of Wisconsin and                
              Professor Jairo Figuereido of UNICAMP, Sao Paulo, is to stimulate              
              cooperative research between U.S. and Brazilian mathematicians.                
              As such, the workshop will try to address the following topics:                
              diagnostic of on-going research efforts in both the U.S. and                   
              Brazil in the area of partial differential equations; identifica-              
              tion of areas of common interests and likely future collaborators;             
              and organization of joint planning activities for cooperation in               
              the short, medium, and long term.
