Abstract    :
              On September 22, 1989, the worst hurricane in over two hundred                 
              years hit the coast of South Carolina and severely damaged or                  
              destroyed portions of our marine laboratory complex.  The support              
              provided to this project will assist in reconstructing and                     
              modernizing research facilities to permit on-going research                    
              projects to resume full capacity and to provide an improved                    
              research environment for new research programs requiring newer                 
              technologies.  Specifically, support will be provided for two                  
              intertwined aspects of the master reconstruction plan: 1) to                   
              partially defray the cost of renovating a damaged laboratory                   
              building to make it an experimental seawater laboratory; and 2)                
              to construct a major sector of new space in a larger laboratory                
              facility designed for analytical, computational, data management               
              and experimental programs.  The University of South Carolina will              
              provide matching funds and FEMA will assist financially in                     
              construction of the new laboratory.  These new facilities will                 
              greatly enhance research opportunities for both visiting                       
              scientists and those from USC.
