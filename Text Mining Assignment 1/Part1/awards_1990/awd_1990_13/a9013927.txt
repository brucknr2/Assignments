Abstract    :
                   While much progress has been made in the forecasting of                   
              locally heavy snowfalls, there are still times when our                        
              technology is not capable of adequately anticipating these                     
              events.  A major focus of the mesoscale meteorological community               
              is to further our understanding of the processes responsible for               
              locally heavy snows and, therefore, eventually to improve the                  
              forecasting of these events.                                                   
                   Under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions Program,                 
              the Principal Investigator will perform a detailed diagnostic                  
              investigation of a record setting snowstorm that occurred in the               
              upper midwest of the U.S.  While the forecasts of this storm did               
              indicate that a significant storm would affect the region, the                 
              mesoscale (local) features and timing of the heaviest snow were                
              not forecast.  In this research, the Principal Investigator will               
              use conventional operational information and data from a local                 
              surface network to attempt to test a series of hypotheses that                 
              should help clarify the reasons for the timing and quantity of                 
              precipitation from this storm.  Two undergraduate students will                
              participate fully in this research with one being supported via                
              cost sharing from the Principal Investigator's institution.
