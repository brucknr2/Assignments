Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are (i) to develop a unified                   
              geometric theory of objects and their boundaries in n-dimensional              
              discrete spaces, and (ii) to develop algorithms for detecting                  
              objects and boundaries in n-dimensional images.  The approach to               
              theory development uses an orthogonal tesselation of the n-space               
              into hypercubes, leading to results which are discrete                         
              counterparts of some essential results of continuous topology.                 
              Thus, objects and boundaries can be represented as graphs, and                 
              their detection translates to graph traversal.  The algorithm                  
              development focuses on devising efficient traversal algorithms,                
              both when the images are locally segmentable and when they may                 
              not be.  In the former case there is always a unique spanning                  
              tree which is easy to traverse.  In the latter case, there is no               
              unique solutino and hence the approach is to develop optimal                   
              (e.g., using dynamic programming) and suboptimal traversal                     
              strategies.  The PIs have a long history of contributions to the               
              analysis of medical images and tomography.  The development of                 
              common theory and algorithms for visualization and analysis of                 
              images will be of use in many disciplines using multidimensional               
              image data.
