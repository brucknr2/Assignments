Abstract    :
                   AEROCE is a multi-disciplinary atmospheric and marine                     
              chemistry research program centered in the North Atlantic region.              
              The program objectives include understanding the chemical                      
              climatology over the North Atlantic Ocean using observations of                
              ozone, chemical tracers and other substances; estimating the                   
              export of combustion sulfur and nitrogen from North America; and               
              understanding the impact of atmospheric deposition on chemical                 
              cycles.                                                                        
                   The primary objective of this project is to understand the                
              role of meteorological factors in the observed chemical                        
              variability.  The P.I. will prepare and analyze numerous                       
              meteorological products, including isentropic air mass                         
              trajectories back in time from the four AEROCE stations, analysis              
              of radiosonde ascents from nearby official observing stations,                 
              and compilations and analyses of routine meteorological reports                
              from adjacent stations and stations in source areas, will                      
              synthesize these meteorological results with the chemical                      
              observations, calculating and analyzing the main transport paths               
              and their seasonal variation for each site.
