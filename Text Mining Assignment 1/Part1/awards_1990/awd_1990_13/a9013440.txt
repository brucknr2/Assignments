Abstract    :
              Structural  biology is fundamental to the advancement of                       
              basic biomedical science and diffraction methods provide the                   
              most definitive structural information.  New crystal                           
              structures of biological macromolecules are now being                          
              determined routinely at a very high rate; new techniques, for                  
              example those based on novel detectors, synchrotron sources,                   
              or diffuse scattering, continue to be introduced; and the                      
              advent of protein engineering has lately facilitated the                       
              difficult step of extracting mechanism from structure and                      
              re-emphasized the connection between the structural and                        
              informational aspects of molecular biology.                                    
                                                                                             
              Discussion of these results and of continuing developments in                  
              methodology is important to the progress of the field.  The                    
              Gordon Conference on Diffraction Methods in Molecular Biology                  
              is the premier forum for such discussion.
