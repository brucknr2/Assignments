Abstract    :
              This research involves numerical simulation of two-phase                       
              flows, in order to gain insight into the details of the                        
              interaction between phases.  The two phases are liquid and                     
              gas, in particular the interaction between bubbles and the                     
              surrounding liquid, the interaction between bubbles, and the                   
              interaction between bubbles and bounding walls.  The technique                 
              will be full numerical simulation in three-dimensions of the                   
              governing partial differential equations, combined the with                    
              special techniques to track and model interface                                
              configurations.                                                                
              The investigation will provide essential information on                        
              fundamental mechanisms in multi-phase flows, which is                          
              necessary for modeling of such flows as commonly encountered                   
              in various engineering systems.
