Abstract    :
              This project will underwrite the construction of a research                    
              laboratory on the Nelson Environmental Study Area.  The facility               
              will contain standard wet laboratories; animal behavior room with              
              an adjoining observation booth; two general purpose laboratory                 
              rooms for activities not requiring wet laboratory facilities; a                
              room for storage of field equipment; a computer/meteorology room;              
              office and conference room.  The facility will support                         
              experimental ecology in five major areas: small mammal population              
              biology, plant population biology and physiological ecology,                   
              mechanisms of secondary succession, air-ecosystem interactions,                
              and dynamics of aquatic ecosystems.  The building will enhance                 
              current research programs, increase the efficiency of                          
              field/laboratory interactive measurements, make possible the                   
              development of now lines of research now foreclosed because of                 
              the lack of a research laboratory, and make the KER more                       
              accessible to the national scientific community.
