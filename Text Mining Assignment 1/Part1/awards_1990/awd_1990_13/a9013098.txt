Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Serological techniques are examined to improve the geometric                   
              characterization of fracture surfaces and  microstructural                     
              features in three dimensions.  This research is based on a solid               
              foundation developed in past research by the principal                         
              investigators in the areas of experimental measurements, computer              
              simulations, and theoretical stereology.  Emphasis is placed on                
              techniques to estimate spatial distribution of microstructural                 
              features in three-dimensions from measurements on plane sections;              
              quantification of anisotropy of fracture surfaces and                          
              microstructural features from plane section measurements; and                  
              quantification of fractal characteristics and surface roughness                
              of fracture surfaces from fracture surface profiles.  Although                 
              the research centers on 4340 steel, copper, and a metal-matrix                 
              composite, the science applies to all materials.
