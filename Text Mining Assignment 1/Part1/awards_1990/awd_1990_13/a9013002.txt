              The purpose of this travel award is to support a visit                         
              at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks by Dr. Eduard                           
              Yershov, Chairman of the Department of Geocryology at                          
              Moscow State University, to explore the possibility of                         
              developing a proposal for long-term cooperation on                             
              permafrost as related to world climate change with Dr.                         
              Thomas E. Osterkamp of the University of Alaska's                              
              Geophysics Institute.  This is a targeted topic under                          
              the general category of Arctic Research under the

              Academy of Sciences for basic research cooperation.                            
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine                                  
              complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                      
              mutual interest and competence in the field of basic                           
              scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,                     
              and mutuality of benefit.
