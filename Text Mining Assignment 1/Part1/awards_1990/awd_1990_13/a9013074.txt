Abstract    :
              This project supports a 3-day workshop entitled "Opportunities                 
              and Challenges in Crystallization Research" to be held at the                  
              Engineering Research Institute at Iowa State University in                     
              November 1990.  A great deal of progress has been made in the                  
              last three decades following the development of techniques for                 
              modeling crystal size distribution and relating the                            
              distribution to process design and crystallization kinetics.                   
              As a result of the analyses facilitated by these modeling                      
              techniques, much has been learned about the nature of crystal                  
              growth and nucleation in mixed suspensions such as those                       
              common in the process industries.  The effects of the                          
              phenomena of secondary nucleation and growth dispersion and                    
              the effects of trace quantities of additives or impurities                     
              have been delineated.  Progress has been made toward                           
              fundamental understanding of these phenomena.  This past work                  
              has opened the door for additional research that has the                       
              potential to vastly increase knowledge about crystallization                   
              from solution.  This workshop will assess this progress and                    
              determine the potential for future work to increase our                        
              understanding of this important phenomenon.                                    
                                                                                             
              The participants for this workshop are chosen from both                        
              industry and academia, and they will include the leading                       
              researchers involved in research and development of                            
              applications of crystallization from solution.  A final report                 
              will be provided to the National Science Foundation.  A                        
              summary of the findings will be submitted for publication.
