Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the dissertation research of a cultural                    
              anthropologist who will study the negotiation of social power                  
              through the shaping of traditional Black music styles in the                   
              South African music industry.  The student will study the                      
              production process in the recording studio, where engineers and                
              music producers contest and negotiate the content and cultural                 
              qualities of the music being recorded.  The basic issues to be                 
              examined are the sources of control over the content of the                    
              music.   Methods include ethnographic participant observation of               
              several studios in Johannesburg; recording and transcription of                
              the work in progress, open ended interviews with participants,                 
              observation of talent scouting trips into the rural areas, and                 
              observation of live performances.                                              
                                                                                             
              The power of popular music to define the cultural position of                  
              people in their society is striking throughout the world.                      
              Understanding how the cultural content of music gets produced in               
              this particular case (as more or less traditional in a context                 
              where tradition is related to race in a complex way) can aid                   
              understanding of the function of music in multi-ethnic society in              
              general.
