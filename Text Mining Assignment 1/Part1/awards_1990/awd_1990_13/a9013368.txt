Abstract    :
              This Research for Undergraduate Eduation award will permit the                 
              Principal Investigator (PI) to continue studies of the pulsations              
              of stars in their terminal stages of evolution, white dwarfs and               
              pre-white dwarfs.  Using portable instrumentation constructed from             
              a previous NSF award, the PI will spend 75 nights per year with one            
              of two undergraduate students monitoring the light variations of               
              candidate white dwarf pulsators.  Many of the current sample of                
              pulsating white dwarfs were discovered by this PI. The PI will                 
              continue these searches, and will also search for pulsating stars              
              that have previously ejected most of their masses to become white              
              dwarfs (planetary nebulae) and will also compare the pulsation                 
              periods of a selected star to determine whether the star's ageing              
              can be followed in "real time" from its shortening pulsation                   
              periods.
