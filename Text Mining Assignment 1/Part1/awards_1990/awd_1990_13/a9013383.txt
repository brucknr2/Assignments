Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the project is to determine the variation                     
              in the bulk and crustal natural remanenet magnetization (NRM)                  
              with respect to age of the oceanic crust. Magnetic anomaly                     
              data from MAGSAT satellite and sea-surface measurements from                   
              the North Pacific and North Atlantic will be used. The work                    
              will help resolve uncertainty concerning the mechanism of                      
              acquisition of remenent magnetization within the oceanic                       
              crust.
