Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is well-established that a wide variety of organisms,                       
              including humans, have internal, biological clocks that are                    
              instrumental in allowing them to maintain synchrony to both daily              
              (i.e. circadian) and annual cycles of environmental change.  Most              
              mammals are exposed, on a daily basis, to environmental cues such              
              as sunrise and sunset or day/night temperature fluctuations.                   
              These cues are used to synchronize their internal clocks to local              
              environmental time.  To understand the biological time keeping                 
              systems used by mammals, Dr. Goldman examines animals in                       
              hibernation.  He will determine the hormonal and neural                        
              mechanisms that these animals use to time and coordinate the end               
              of hibernation.  Dr. Goldman's work will provide significant                   
              insights into understanding how the internal clocks continue to                
              function in an environment where the animals remain sheltered for              
              a significant period from most environmental cues.  These results              
              will increase our understanding of the physiological mechanisms                
              regulating the maintenance of internal clocks and, therefore, may              
              contribute to the development of treatments which would reduce                 
              the detrimental consequences associated with jetlag.
