Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                     
              Gary Evans, University of California, Irvine and Professor                     
              Gunn Johansson, Department of Psychology, University of                        
              Stockholm, Sweden.  The objective of the project is to                         
              determine characteristics of the work environment that                         
              affect occupational stress and the etiology of cardiovascular                  
              disease.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The specific research proposed will evaluate an experiment in                  
              environmental and job re-design being conducted by the                         
              Stockholm Public Transit District.  The intervention aims to                   
              reduce traffic congestion for bus drivers and improve                          
              passenger service.  A before/after quasi-experimental design                   
              with a non-equivalent control group will evaluate the                          
              experimental intervention. Multi-methodological assessments                    
              of occupational stress will include psychophysiological                        
              indices, self-reports and trained observations of drivers                      
              while on the job.  Detailed assessments of the physical and                    
              psychosocial bus driving environment will be carried out.                      
              This collaboration brings together a Swedish work psychologist                 
              experienced in psychophysiological measurements of the                         
              impacts of psychosocial work characteristics, with the US                      
              investigator, who is an environmental psychologist with                        
              expertise in stress research and quantitative methods.
