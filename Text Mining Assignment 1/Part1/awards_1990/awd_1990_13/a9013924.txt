Abstract    :
              Description:  This proposal supports the collaboration of                      
              Dr. Dilhan Kalyon of Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT)                     
              and Dr. Erdal Bayramli of Middle East Technical University                     
              (METU) in Turkey.  The proposed research will be carried out                   
              at both SIT and METU.  Dr. Bayramli will prepare coatings at                   
              METU and Dr. Kalyon will perform surface and rheological                       
              characterization experiments at SIT.  Project funding will                     
              allow Dr. Bayramli to spend two months per year at SIT and                     
              Dr. Kalyon will visit METU for a similar period of time.                       
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This proposal will bring together research                             
              scientists from two countries working in the area of wall                      
              slippage of polymer melts.  It is anticipated that this                        
              collaborative research will result in a better understanding                   
              of the processability of polymeric resins during various                       
              processing flows.  Dr. Bayramli will have an opportunity to                    
              become familiar with research techniques at SIT and,                           
              likewise, Dr. Kalyon will benefit from the time he spends at                   
              METU.  Therefore, this proposal fulfils objectives of the                      
              Science in Developing Countries Program in its exchange and                    
              transfer of scientific knowledge through an international                      
              collaboration.
