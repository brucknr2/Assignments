Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support for one year for a                
              graduate student in mathematical logic who will do thesis                      
              research under the joint direction of Anil Nerode (Professor,                  
              Department of Mathematics, and Director, Mathematical Sciences                 
              Institute) and Juris Hartmanis (Professor, Department of Computer              
              Science).  The research uses methods of mathematical logic to                  
              study the complexity of parallel computation.  Parallel                        
              computation is perhaps the most promising route to vast increases              
              in computational speed, but it is notoriously difficult to                     
              analyse compared with the traditional serial computation that                  
              most existing computers do.
