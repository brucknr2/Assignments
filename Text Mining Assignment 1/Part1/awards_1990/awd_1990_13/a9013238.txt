Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The rates of photosynthesis of phytoplankton in the ocean are                  
              affected not only by the availability of light and nutrients,                  
              but also by the turbulence in the water column.  Dr. Thomas                    
              will continue his studies on the effects of small scale                        
              turbulence on the growth rate, cell division, and cell                         
              morphology of marine phytoplankton using laboratory cultures.                  
              He will examine two red tide species using varying degrees of                  
              intermittent turbulence.  In addition, he will investigate the                 
              effects of reduced temperature and turbulence on the viability                 
              and behavior of the organisms.  This research will aid in the                  
              prediction of red tides in both time and space.
