Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A continuing problem in the demographics of the U.S. astronomical              
              community is the scarcity of high-quality young solar physicists.              
              The average age of solar astronomers is among the highest of any               
              astronomical discipline, and this problem is aggravated by the                 
              dearth of U.S. academic institutions that actively support solar               
              research.  The Principal Investigator (PI) seeks to alleviate this             
              problem through a two-week, NATO Advanced Study Institute summer               
              course in Scotland.  This course would bring together experts in               
              various subdisciplines of solar physics to teach graduate students             
              the important advances in techniques in concepts in their fields.              
              Detailed notes from the course would be written by the astronomers,            
              and would be made available to the students and other interested               
              parties.  Some 80% of the expenses for this course will be paid by             
              the NATO ASI.  However, owing to certain restrictions on the                   
              international distribution of students in ASI courses, the PI is               
              requesting additional support for travel from the NSF.  It is hoped            
              that this summer course will alleviate the scarcity of young solar             
              astronomers in the U.S. and will help highlight the demographic                
              problem in this discipline that has existed for at least two                   
              decades.
