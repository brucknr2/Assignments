Abstract    :
              This project involves the application of Glymour's                             
              "bootstrapping" account of evidential relevance to a                           
              methodological controversy in cognitive neuropsychology.  The                  
              controversy centers on an influential claim by Caramazza that                  
              brain-damaged performance can provide relevant evidence for                    
              models of cognition only in the form of single-case studies.                   
              If this claim is true, then group studies of brain-damaged                     
              performance--in particular, all studies based on the classical                 
              syndrome categories (such as Broca's aphasia, Wernicke's                       
              aphasia, conduction aphasia, etc.)--are worthless as                           
              confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence in constraining rival                 
              functional architectures.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this project is twofold:  firstly,                    
              to clarify the different methodological roles of single-case                   
              versus group studies, as manifested in dissociations in                        
              performance, double dissociations, and associations of                         
              deficits (the typical operational elements in cognitive                        
              neuropsychology), on the basis of a bootstrapping account of                   
              evidential relevance;  and secondly, to evaluate bootstrapping                 
              relative to other accounts of evidential relevance--for                        
              example, the hypothetico-deductive account and the Bayesian                    
              account--in terms of the detailed working out of this                          
              application.  The long-term aim is a complete analysis of the                  
              logic of testing models of cognition, as an aspect of the                      
              general theory construction in the sciences.
