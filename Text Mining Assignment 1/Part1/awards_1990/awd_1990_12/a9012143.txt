Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This network of graphics workstations, file server and associated              
              graphics will support the condensed matter theory research group,              
              providing computer visualization and windowing capabilities.                   
              Research programs include Quantum Monte Carlo methods applied to               
              liquid and solid He, atoms and molecules; calculations of                      
              dynamical structure factors; molecular dynamics for the study of               
              new and novel vibrational excitations in periodic anharmonic                   
              lattices; first-principles electronic structure methods combined               
              with molecular dynamics for the investigations of properties of                
              amorphous and crystalline phases of semiconductor bulk samples                 
              and surfaces; and analysis of scanning tunneling microscope and                
              atomic force microscope images of biopolymers.
