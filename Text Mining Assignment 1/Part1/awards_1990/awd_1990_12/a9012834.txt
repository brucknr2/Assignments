Abstract    :
              It is a truism that science changes our view of our place in                   
              the universe.  The rise of modern science which came with the                  
              Copernican Revolution of the 16th century moved the earth and                  
              mankind from the center to the periphery of creation.  The                     
              Darwinian Revolution of the 19th century made mankind itself                   
              just one more of the animals which evolved from the primordial                 
              ooze.  The quantum revolution of this century called into                      
              doubt our most trusted theories of causation.  The project                     
              that Professor Roe is undertaking aims to examine another                      
              scientific theory, one which has hardly been studied at all,                   
              but which, she argues, radically altered man's view of God and                 
              the State in the 18th century.  Her study focuses on the role                  
              biological ideas played in the mid 18th century, when                          
              traditional concepts of nature, morality, and society were                     
              being challenged.  During the High Enlightenment (1750s to                     
              1770s) the notion of a divinely ordered, unchanging, and                       
              hierarchical universe (including both the natural and social                   
              worlds) clashed with a new view of nature and society without                  
              God, in which processes of change and development replaced                     
              those of stable harmony.  Biological ideas, especially on the                  
              generation of life, were taken up into this controversy and                    
              in turn were charged with new significance by it.  Professor                   
              Roe's study focuses on a number of individuals (Buffon,                        
              Needham, Bonnet, Haller, Voltaire, Helvetius, Diderot,                         
              d'Holbach, and other contemporaries), and recreates the                        
              intellectual and political world of mid-century Paris and                      
              Geneva.  She aims for a contextual history that demonstrates                   
              how the biological controversy arose within these intellectual                 
              and social crises and why materialist views of nature seemed                   
              so threatening to some and so provocative to others.
