Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                 
              Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Gimarc will                       
              develop qualitative theoretical models to explain the basic                    
              nature of molecular structure and bonding in clusters of                       
              elements in the main group of the periodic table.                              
                                                                                             
              Clusters of homoatomic main group elements will be studied in                  
              order to form a qualitative molecular orbital model with which                 
              to relate the various structures within a given cluster class.                 
              Molecular orbitals and molecular structures will be generated                  
              by geometry optimized ab initio SCF MO calculations at various                 
              levels of basis set accuracy.  Correlation diagrams for energy                 
              levels in various possible shapes will be constructed and                      
              interpreted using atomic orbital composition diagrams.  This                   
              will allow the PI to develop an understanding of the relative                  
              stabilities of the various possible cluster structures.
