Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A workshop/conference concerning the establishment of a national               
              parallel code  repository will allow the scientists involved to                
              exchange ideas and views about the issues necessary for the successful         
              implementation of such a resource.  It will allow a focal point of well        
              documented and structured, significant code kernels to be used by              
              scientists and engineers as a starting point in the development of             
              optimally designed parallel code.
