Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Campanian and Maestrichtian interval is characterized by a                     
              general global cooling trend and an evolutionary radiation                     
              of planktonic foraminifera. The long-term cooling trend and                    
              an evolutionary radiation of planktonic foraminifera.  The                     
              long-term cooling trend had an impact on latitudinal                           
              thermal gradients, on the formation of oceanic water masses, on                
              rates and patterns of renewal of deep-water masses and                         
              attendant dissolved oxygen. This study will use planktonic                     
              foraminifera to: (i) construct a uniform integrated                            
              biomagnetostratigraphy for the Campanian-Maestrichtian; (ii)                   
              quantitative analysis of faunas, assessment of relative                        
              preservation and interpretation in terms of paleoecologic                      
              variables; and (iii) stable isotopic studies of relatively                     
              unaltered fine-fraction, planktonic and benthic foraminiferal                  
              samples for inferences about variations in paleotemperature/                   
              paleosalinity and carbon cycling. The study will focus on about 8              
              important DSDP/ODP Sites in which the Campanian-Maestrichtian to               
              unravel the palesceanographic trends of this interval.
