Abstract    :
                   Excited states of atoms and molecules are present in                      
              lasers, high-temperature plasmas, discharges and flames; the                   
              behavior of such systems is partially governed by the                          
              structure and properties of those excited states.  This                        
              proposal examines the excited states of a variety of atoms                     
              and molecules.  During the first year the research will focus                  
              on one-electron atoms in external electric and magnetic                        
              fields.  Also, two-electron atoms and the collisions of atoms                  
              and molecules in excited states will be pursued.  The overall                  
              objective of the research is the characterization of chaotic                   
              spectra and the relationship of classical chaos to "quantum                    
              chaology."
