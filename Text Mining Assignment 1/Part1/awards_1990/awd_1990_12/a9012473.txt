Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Remineralization of Biogenic Material at the Seafloor: Temporal                
              and Spatial Variability Temporal variability of fluxes across                  
              the sediment-water interface at the GOFS Bermuda Time Series                   
              Site will be measured to characterize the bentic cycles of                     
              biogenic sediment components of an oligotrophic gyre.  Data                    
              collected to date demonstrate that there is large temporal                     
              variability, and that the cycle closely parallels that of                      
              particulate fluxes.  The relationship between particle fluxes,                 
              fluxes across the interface and the amplitude of variability                   
              will be used to characterize the occurrence, reactivity and                    
              significance of "labile" organic carbon remineralization at                    
              this site.  In addition, experiments seek to define the                        
              stoichiometry, rates, and location in the sediment column of                   
              diagenetic reactions affecting organic matter, CaCO3, and                      
              biogenic SiO2.  The data should uniquely define the response of                
              benthic processes to varying conditions in the water column and                
              surface ocean. Studies of organic matter degradation and CaCOO3                
              dissolution will be extended to a regional scale with a                        
              transect of the Western North Atlantic continental margin.                     
              This research seeks to define the amounts and rate of                          
              diagenetic dissolution of CaCO above the lysocline, as well as                 
              the factors that influence this aspect of the CaCO3 cycle in                   
              the oceans
