Abstract    :
              This award supports the Fifth International Workshop on Natural                
              Language Generation.  The Fifth Workshop is designed to foster                 
              interaction between basic researchers in computational                         
              linguistics and natural language generation and researchers in                 
              areas that wish to make use of the results of state of the art                 
              research in these areas, in particular, researchers in machine                 
              translation, intelligent tutoring systems, user interfaces, and                
              expert system explanation.  Using generation in these areas                    
              places new demands on natural language generation and it is                    
              increasingly important that "basic researchers" and "users"                    
              interact in forums such as this.  In addition, the workshop is                 
              intended to be a vehicle for wider distribution of the newly                   
              available tools.
