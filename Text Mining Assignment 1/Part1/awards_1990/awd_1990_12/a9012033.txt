Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The distribution of Ba in the ocean is similar to the                          
              refractory components, silica and alkalinity.  Therefore                       
              reconstructions of Ba in ancient water masses based on the Ba                  
              content of foraminifera shells can be used to probe the                        
              circulation and chemistry of past oceans.  Previous work has                   
              shown that the dramatically altered distribution of Ba in the                  
              glacial oceans ban be explained by climatically driven changes                 
              in ocean circulation.  This research will 1) ascertain how                     
              faithfully planktonic and benthic foraminifera recorder                        
              seawater Ba via further core top studies as well as culturing                  
              of planktonic foraminifera to directly determine the uptake of                 
              Ba into their shells; 2) broaden and increase the detail of                    
              oceanic Ba measurements at the 18 kyr Glacial Maximum; 3)                      
              acquire a long (220 kyr) record of benthic Ba in the equatorial                
              Pacific; and, 4) use planktonic Ba as a tracer of meltwater                    
              influx to the Gulf of Mexico at the last deglaciation.
