Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is to describe the effect of               
              ions on the segmental and local motions of polymers in the presence            
              and absence of low-molecular-weight solvent molecules.  The                    
              polymers and salts of interest are those that exhibit high ionic               
              conduction such as poly(ethylene oxide) and lithium perchlorate.               
              Multifield, multinuclear, and variable temperature nuclear spin                
              lattice relaxation experiments will be performed on different                  
              polymer/salt systems.  The resulting T1 data will be analyzed using            
              dynamic models for the segmental and local motions of the polymer.             
              The relationship between polymer motion and ionic conduction will              
              be investigated by this technique.                                             
                                                                                             
                   Segmental motion of the polymer contributes to high ionic                 
              conduction in polymer/salt systems according to dynamic bond                   
              percolation theory;.  The interaction between certain polymers and             
              salts is an example of the importance of site-specific interactions            
              in determining the properties of polymer-based materials.  This                
              study investigates site-specific interactions by a dynamic rather              
              than static approach to reveal the impact of these interactions.               
              Ultimately, the results of this research will provide the basis for            
              a comprehensive analysis of the present state of theory and                    
              encourage further theoretical development.
