Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nitrogen assimilation is a key event in the life of green plants,              
              and nitrate reductase is a key enzyme in this assimilation.  This              
              proposal is directed toward elucidating the regulatory aspects of              
              the activity and amount of this enzyme in the alga Chlorella; the              
              results of the research should contribute to increasing                        
              agricultural productivity and more efficient utilization of N by               
              plants. //
