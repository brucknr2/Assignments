Abstract    :
              The Public Affairs Video Archives at Purdue University includes                
              many congressional hearings and public policy conferences which                
              involve science and technology, scientists and engineers.  Funds               
              for this project will enable the Archives to develop several edited            
              videos, video series and teaching guides to facilitate and                     
              encourage the use of these programs for the study of ethics, values            
              and policy development involving science and technology.  A recent             
              graduate will work with university students and faculty to develop             
              these materials and test them in classrooms.  Advisors will assist             
              in the development of ethics components.                                       
                                                                                             
              The topic of this proposal is of highest priority for Ethics and               
              Values Studies.  The qualifications and track record of the                    
              investigators and organization are excellent.  The project provides            
              a cost-effective test of the feasibility of developing edited video            
              programming on social and ethical concerns associated with science             
              and technology for classroom use.  Results will be useful for a                
              wide range of individuals and groups.  The budget is very modest.              
              The proposal is recommended for support.
