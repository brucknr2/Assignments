Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI proposes to investigate the effects of three types of                   
              coffee cultivation on the native insect fauna associated with the              
              area.  Preliminary planning activities include:  literature review,            
              site location, necessary permissions and collaborating                         
              institutions, experimentation with methodologies, preliminary data             
              gathering, data analysis and interpretation, experiment redesign               
              and writing of final proposal.  Activities during the first year               
              will involve the comparison of 3 management systems:  1)                       
              Traditional agroforestry system with a variety of shade trees                  
              interplanted with coffee; 2) the agroforestry system with just one             
              shade tree species intensively managed through periodic pruning;               
              and 3) monocultural coffee with no shade tree.  Representative                 
              farms will be selected.  Base-line data related to ant                         
              assemblages, insect pest and disease densities and distributions               
              will be gathered using standard sampling methods.  Photon flux                 
              density and CO2 uptake will be calculated directly using the                   
              Solarcal computer program.  Satellite photographs will be used to              
              determine the area of the country planted in the monocultural                  
              system.  The effect of nitrogen fertilization and the effect of                
              pesticide insecticide applications on the ant assemblage and on                
              pests will be studied in subsequent years.
