Abstract    :
                   The objectives of this project are:  to conduct research                  
              in numerical relativity and cosmology aimed at understanding                   
              the physics of the gravitational field.  This work will be                     
              carried out using large-scale numerical simulations supported                  
              by analytic work and extensive test-bed calculations.  A major                 
              feature of this program is the development of significant                      
              numerical tools and their successful application to outstanding                
              problems in gravitational waves and astrophysics.
