Abstract    :
              Description:  This project is for support of U.S.                              
              participation in the International Conference on Advances                      
              in Structural Testing, Analysis and Design, scheduled for                      
              July 29-August 3, 1990 in Bangalore, India.  The                               
              conference aims to bring together scientists, engineers                        
              and designers of modern structures to review perceptions                       
              for synthesis and integration of design, analysis and                          
              testing.  Topics will include:  composite structures,                          
              fatigue and fracture mechanics, CAD/CAM/CAE, expert                            
              systems and artificial intelligence, finite                                    
              element/boundary element methods, experimental stress                          
              analysis, non destructive testing, static and  dynamic                         
              testing, structural dynamics and model analysis,                               
              aeroelasticity and structure-control interactions,                             
              fluid-solid interaction and non-linear mechanics.  The                         
              proceedings are expected to be published by McGraw Hill                        
              by the conference dates.  Participants are expected from                       
              the major West European countries, the USSR, China, Japan                      
              and Australia as well as the U.S. and India.                                   
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The meeting is expected to be one of the main                          
              conferences in the field in India with a broad scope                           
              covering many areas of interest to civil, mechanical and                       
              aeronautical engineers, and to scientists in mathematics,                      
              artificial intelligence, computer applications and in                          
              materials science.  The wide participation from major                          
              countries of Europe, Japan, Australia as well as the U.S.                      
              and India provide for an important forum for exchange of                       
              information and for increasing collaboration.
