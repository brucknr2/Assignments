Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed work is a continuation of                                         
              current research to develop impedance                                          
              pneumography as a new diagnostic tool. The                                     
              investigators propose to build a vest-like                                     
              garment with multiple electrodes through                                       
              which impedance changes across the chest can                                   
              be monitored during breathing. Using                                           
              numerical techniques an "impedance image" of                                   
              the thorax may be obtained. The device should                                  
              be very useful for accurately monitoring                                       
              changes in tidal volume as a function of                                       
              time; a new generation of apnea monitors may                                   
              result from the proposed research.
