Abstract    :
                   In 1985, a major research effort in the eastern                           
              Mediterranean Basin began.  Since that time, a number of physical              
              oceanographic observations have been made by a number of                       
              countries participating in the research.  This effort is to                    
              synthesize the observations via several different numerical                    
              models.  The PI's have a heirarchy of models to address the                    
              general circulation of the Mediterranean, the formation of the                 
              Levantine water mass, and the role of mesoscale features in the                
              region.
