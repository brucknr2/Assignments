Abstract    :
                   In 1986, the National Research Council (NCR) established the              
              Computer Science and Technology Board in recognition of the                    
              importance of computer science as an academic discipline and an                
              intellectual domain, and of the increasingly critical role played by           
              information technology in virtually all facets of life.  The Board's           
              charter is a broad one:  to ensure that the U.S. makes every effort to         
              develop and use the major new national resource represented in                 
              computer science and technology.  The computer's contributions to              
              innovation and economic growth, to national security, to the quality           
              of life, and to scientific progress are pervasive and affect the               
              programs of a number of federal agencies, as well as domestic                  
              industries.  Until now, however, no organization has been suitably             
              positioned to address or influence the overall condition of this               
              important field.                                                               
                   The Computer Science and Technology Board is intended to be a             
              central asset for identifying the implications of new technologies,            
              assessing current and proposed policies that affect computer science           
              and technology, and anticipating challenges to the strength of the             
              U.S. computer science posture.                                                 
                   Over the next 24 months, the Computer Science and Technology              
              Board will assess how best to organize the conduct of research and             
              teaching in the computer field, in light of emerging and anticipated           
              conditions.  The study will be performed by a committee drawn from a           
              variety of subdisciplines, with representation and input from                  
              administrators who control key resource pools, and will build on past          
              studies as relevant.//
