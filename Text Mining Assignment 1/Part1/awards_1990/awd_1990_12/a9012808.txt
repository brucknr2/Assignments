Abstract    :
              This research involves an experimental study of nonlinear optical              
              waveguides made from conjugated polymers. A punp-probe technique               
              capable of picosecond time resolution will be employed to measure              
              the intensity-dependent refractive indices of conjugated polymers              
              such as p-phenylenevinylene (PPV) and its derivatives,                         
              polythienylenevinylene, the poly (3-alkylthiophenes) etc. for                  
              which waveguide quality thin films can now be fabricated.  The                 
              technique can determine both the magnitude and sign of the third               
              order nonlinear susceptibility.  Determination of the sign is                  
              important in sorting out the different mechanisms.
