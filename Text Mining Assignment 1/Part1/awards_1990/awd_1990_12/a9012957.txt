Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A major emphasis of marine geosciences is to understand the role               
              of hydrogeological processes in the evolution of the oceanic                   
              lithosphere. The role of fluids in the crust is now known to be                
              important in modifying crustal chemistry, in controlling the                   
              chemistry of seawater and in cooling the oceanic lithosphere.                  
              Although ocean drilling provides a mechanism for examining the                 
              results of these processes directly, performing long-term                      
              experiments and repeat observations are required to understand                 
              the rate at which these processes occur. Such experiments are                  
              best performed through reentry of drill holes at periodic                      
              intervals or by deployment of long term instruments. The cost of               
              drillship operations has lead the international community to                   
              develop alternate ways of deploying experiments in drill holes.                
                                                                                             
              This award will support US scientists to participate with French               
              colleagues using a submersible to place instruments in drillholes              
              in the North Atlantic. The US scientists will be responsible for               
              measurement of fluid flow and crustal strain. Because the project              
              represents a venture into an emerging research area and is a new               
              approach to an old research topic it is being funded as an SGER                
              award.
