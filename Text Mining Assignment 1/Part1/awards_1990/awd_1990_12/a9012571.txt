Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This instrument is designed to monitor the work function of                    
              surfaces during processing.  It will measure the contact                       
              potential difference between the surface and an inert reference                
              electrode by avariable capacitance non-mechanical, non-contact                 
              technique.  The instrument design allows monitoring of surface                 
              electrical properties of high Tc oxide superconductors during                  
              manufacture of SQUIDS and RF cavity structures, and of                         
              semiconductor wafers during processing.  A modulation technique                
              allows higher frequency operation than standard methods, offering              
              lower noise, faster response, and greater resolution.
