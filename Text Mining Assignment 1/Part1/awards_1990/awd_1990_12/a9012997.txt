Abstract    :
                   Collection of thunderstorms know as mesoscale convective                  
              systems (MCSs) have been shown to be important to the                          
              understanding of a wide range of meteorological phenomena.  MCSs               
              bring beneficial range as well as severe weather and are believed              
              to be important conduits for the redistribution of heat and                    
              moisture in the atmosphere.                                                    
                   The Principal Investigator will continue her studies of the               
              dynamical structures of MCSs and the relationship of these                     
              structures to precipitation production and to the larger-scale                 
              environment.  This observational study will include data from                  
              previously held field programs in the mid-latitudes                            
              (Oklahoma-Kansas Preliminary Regional Experiment for STORM) and                
              the tropics (Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic                      
              Tropical Experiment).
