Abstract    :
              Description:  This project supports participation by six U.S.                  
              scientists in the Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and                     
              Contemporary Needs to be held in Pakistan in June 1990.  That                  
              school has been held annually since 1976.  NSF has supported U.S.              
              participation in four of these years.  The school has some                     
              impressive features:  the continuity of plans and programs, the                
              continuous support of European scientific organization including               
              the Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, the high caliber of             
              lectures from the U.S. and other countries and the broad scope of              
              students and faculty members from South Asian countries who                    
              attend.  The meetings are evolving into one of Pakistans, and South            
              Asias, main scientific events every year.  Topics typically provide            
              overview of recent developments in various branches of physics and             
              related fields (materials, biophysics) and the implications for the            
              society.  Lectures, seminars, and workshops and discussions cover              
              subjects such as energy, condensed matter physics, lasers,                     
              computational physics, nuclear and particle physics, astrophysics,             
              cosmology and biophysics.  The topics to be covered at 1990 meeting            
              include development of advanced materials, accelerator physics,                
              recent trends in solar energy and other alternate energy sources,              
              and atmospheric and oceanic research.  The meetings lead to solid              
              interaction between scientists from the LDC's of South Asia and                
              those from the Western countries with potential for futher                     
              collaboration.  Proceedings of these meetings are usually published            
              and widely disseminated.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This proposal meets very well the objectives of NSF's                  
              Science in Develping Countries Program in providing a strong link              
              with LDC's to help build lasting relationships in Science and                  
              Technology.
