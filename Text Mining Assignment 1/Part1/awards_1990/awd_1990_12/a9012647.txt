Abstract    :
              This proposal is to assemble a new archive of data on gender                   
              attitudes of American men and women from opinion polls taken                   
              between 1936 and 1989.  The research will focus on the sources                 
              and causes of long-term trends in attitudes.  The approach to be               
              taken is that of a "life history" analysis of attitude formation.              
              The purpose of the analyses is (1) to identify the major                       
              historical events shaping the life-history of attitude items, (2)              
              to determine whether the "liberalizing trend" of past decades has              
              stalled in recent years, (3) to measure the relative strength of               
              period and cohort-replacement processes in generating long-term                
              trends, (4) to monitor the changing pattern of intergroup                      
              cleavages in attitudes, and (5) to assess whether changes in                   
              individual level variables can account for the year-by-year                    
              trends.  The analyses should provide important baseline                        
              measurements of the sources and structure of gender attitudes in               
              America.
