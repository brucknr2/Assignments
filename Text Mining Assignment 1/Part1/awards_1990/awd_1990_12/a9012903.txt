Abstract    :
                   Under this award, Dr. Pfeffer and his colleagues will extend              
              the results of their previous work on the effects of topography                
              and beta (Coriolis acceleration) on atmospheric flows through a                
              mix of laboratory experiments with a rotating annulus and                      
              theoretical and numerical modeling studies.  Preliminary studies               
              by this and other groups suggest that topography can affect the                
              speed of the zonal flow, the location and maintenance of large                 
              scale standing waves in the atmospheric flow (blocking                         
              phenomenon), as well as contribute to the chaotic behavior of the              
              atmosphere.  For each of the areas under investigation, the                    
              laboratory results will serve to motivate and initialize                       
              numerical experiments and to verify the model and theoretical                  
              results.                                                                       
                   Dr. Pfeffer and his group represent one of the few                        
              experimental laboratory programs still in existence in this                    
              country.  Their research provides an important and unique                      
              perspective on and contribution to understanding fluid, and in                 
              particular atmospheric, flows.
