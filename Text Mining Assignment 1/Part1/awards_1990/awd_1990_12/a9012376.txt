Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This study will investigate organic matter degradation and                     
              calcium carbonate dissolution at the sea floor with emphasis on                
              examining the generality of the earlier results and improving                  
              the accuracy of the rate constant determination.  The proposal                 
              consists of three main objectives:  a field program,                           
              development of a pCO2 microprofiling device and a laborabory                   
              investigation.  The field study will take place in  the                        
              productive eastern equatorial Pacific.  Profiler studies will                  
              be coordinated with benthic flux measurements by Dr. Richard                   
              Jahnke of Skidaway Institution of Oceanography.  Development of                
              remote pCO2 measurement capability is necessary to improve                     
              sensitivity in the determination of the dissolution rate                       
              constant.  This approach will be to adapt a colorimetric fiber                 
              optic technology developed at the University of Washington and                 
              currently being used for low level ammonia measurements.  The                  
              laboratory investigation is designed to test interpretations of                
              the in-situ measurements by measuring the calcium carbonate                    
              dissolution flux while predicting it using microelectrode pH                   
              and pCO2 measurements.
