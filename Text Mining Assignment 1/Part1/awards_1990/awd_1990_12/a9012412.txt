Abstract    :
              A group of about 20 organic chemists will be selected to receive               
              travel assistance to attend the Eighth International IUPAC                     
              Conference on Organic Synthesis in Helsinki, Finland which will                
              be held July 23 to 27, 1990.  The U. S. chemists will present                  
              technical talks and have the opportunity to interact with                      
              specialists from all over the world.  The possibility of travel                
              support will be advertised and the applications will be reviewed               
              by a panel of scientists.  Professional and geographic factors                 
              will be considered in the final selection of grantees.  This                   
              travel grant is being funded by the Synthetic Organic Chemistry                
              Program.
