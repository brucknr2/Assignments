Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Lowell proposes to develop two models for magma-hydrothermal                   
              boundary layer heat transfer at ocean ridge crests. One of the                 
              models will treat vertical hydrothermal boundary layers that                   
              develop adjacent to dikes and rise as plumes to the sea floor.                 
              This type of flow may explain ephemeral black smoker activity                  
              that appears to occur at the margins of magmatic domes. The                    
              second mathematical model concerns heat transfer from a                        
              convecting, freezing magma chamber to a hydrothermal system.                   
              This model will focus on phase separation of seawater and the                  
              formation of a highly saline brine layer at the base of the                    
              hydrothermal system, and the subsequent impact of such a layer on              
              the evolution of the magma-hydrothermal system.
