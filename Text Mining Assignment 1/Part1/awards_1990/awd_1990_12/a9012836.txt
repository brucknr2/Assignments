Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the geometric properties of               
              decompositions of the flag variety induced by generalized Bruhat-              
              Birkhoff type decompositions constructed using root data.  The                 
              principal investigator will study the connections between certain              
              generalized Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, the representation                    
              theory of the associated Kac-Moody Lie algebra and the geometry                
              of these varieties.                                                            
                   This research is in the general area of Lie algebras.  The                
              principal investigator is concerned with the Kazhdan-Lusztig                   
              polynomials which are combinatorially defined objects having deep              
              connections with structures in geometry and representation                     
              theory.  This work is important both in mathematics and physics.
