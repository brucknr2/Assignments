Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This investigation is a continuation of research into the                      
              mechanisms used by hydrothermal vent animals to nurture                        
              themselves and to avoid the toxic potentials of the vent                       
              habitats. The on-site studies will be executed on cruises to                   
              13'N on the East Pacific Rise during 1991 and 1992 in                          
              cooperation with a French group from IFREMER. The studies will                 
              focus on measuring the rates of exchange of CO2, O2, sulfide                   
              and potential nitrogen sources by the intact chemoautotrophic                  
              symbiotic associations (vestimentiferan tubeworms and mussels)                 
              under different conditions of temperature, pH, O2, sulfide and                 
              CO2, to define the environmental requirements and limitations                  
              on these organisms as well as to investigate the interaction of                
              animal and symbiont metabolism in dealing with sulfide and its                 
              oxidation products. The transport of CO2, O2 and reduced sulfur                
              compounds within the animals will be examined by means of                      
              experiments with intact animals and with isolated O2 and                       
              sulfide binding proteins. Similar studies will also be carried                 
              out on the hydrothermal vent crabs to gain an understanding of                 
              their abilities to live continuously in low O2, high sulfide                   
              environments. Similar studies will additionally be conducted                   
              for comparison on non-vent symbiotic and heterotrophic species                 
              as well.
