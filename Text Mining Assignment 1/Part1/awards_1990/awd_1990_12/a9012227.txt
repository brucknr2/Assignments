Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Acetylcholine is the most common neurotransmitter found in                     
              specialized vesicles of nerve cells.  The regulation of the                    
              amount of acetylcholine is critical since this neurochemical is                
              important in nerve cell communication.  The goal of this research              
              is to study the chemical nature of the molecules which transport               
              acetylcholine into storage vesicles.  Biochemical and                          
              immunochemical techniques will be used to purify and sequence                  
              peptides associated with the binding sites.  The investigator has              
              developed and synthesized specialized molecules which can react                
              with the transport molecule by labeling the molecule for further               
              chemical analysis.  In addition to examining the chemical nature               
              of the transport molecule, this study will provide more                        
              information on other functions in which the acetylcholine                      
              transporter complex might perform in the cholinergic nerve                     
              terminal.
