Abstract    :
              The Workshop on Geometry for Molecular Visualization and                       
              Characterization will bring together software developers and                   
              biochemists to discuss the questions, "What computer-generated                 
              geometric representations of molecular structures might be useful              
              for future work by the biochemical community?" and "What software              
              tools might facilitate the specification of these new geometric                
              representations by the biochemist?"                                            
                                                                                             
              The workshop will consist of presentations by participants of work-            
              in-progress and proposed future work.  In addition, round-table                
              discussions to assess the state-of-the-art in this area and future             
              directions will be held.
