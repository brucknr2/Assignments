Abstract    :
              A major question confronting management in U.S. industry is whether            
              the anticipated economic benefits of investments in information                
              technologies are being realized.  the results from prior reported              
              empirical research on this question are at best mixed.  The                    
              researchers consider this problem to be a measurement related issue,           
              and they develop a theory and methodology for determining the                  
              economic impacts of "business value" of information technology.  The           
              focus of the research is on the firm and its profit centers as the             
              unit of analysis.  The research is planned in three phases.  The               
              first phase involves a statistical analysis of manufacturing                   
              industry data acquired by the investigators to test several                    
              conjectures on prior discrepancies and estimate a theoretical model.           
              Based on these results, the model is refined in phase two and                  
              further tested (validated) with two new data sets from banking and             
              insurance industry firms.  The third phase synthesizes management              
              implications of the research for information technology investment             
              decisions.
