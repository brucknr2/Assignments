Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will provide a                       
              workstation, software environment, and research funds for Dr.                  
              Fraser to study vector-quantization approaches to feature                      
              extraction from speech waveforms.  He hopes that recent advances               
              in chaos theory and nonlinear dynamic system estimation can be                 
              applied to isolated-letter recognition without expensive phonemic              
              segmentation and labeling of the training set.  Dr. Fraser and a               
              graduate student will acquire a copy of the speech-recognition                 
              software tools being built by Dr. Ronald Cole at the nearby                    
              Oregon Graduate Institute.
