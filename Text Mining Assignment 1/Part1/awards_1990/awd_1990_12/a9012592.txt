Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigators will follow the proliferative and migratory                  
              behavior of individual precursor cells and their progeny in mouse              
              telencephalon.  They will accomplish this by monitoring the                    
              spatial and temporal properties of development dynamically in                  
              cultured slices of cerebral cortex, which has never been                       
              attempted before.  Precursor cells in the ventricular zone of the              
              telencephalon will be marked by either intracellular injection of              
              fluorescein dextran, by extracellular labeling of small numbers                
              of precursor cells with a lipophilic dye, or with a retroviral                 
              lineage marker.  Subsequently, at selected time intervals, the                 
              individual labeled cells as well as their progeny will be                      
              visualized by video-enhanced confocal fluorescence microscopy.
