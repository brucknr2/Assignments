Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this exploratory study is to develop time                  
              series data on aggregate investments in infratechnology in the                 
              U.S. and to evaluate the statistical relationship between these                
              investments and various indices of technological advancement.  In              
              general, changes in research and development (R&D) expenditures--              
              which capture direct investments into the scientific base,                     
              generic technologies and proprietary technologies--have long been              
              viewed as an important indicator of the technological health of                
              our economy.  The efficiency of conducting R&D, however, depends               
              heavily on investments in infratechnologies, which consist of                  
              nonproprietary measurement and test methods, procedures, and data              
              that support an industry's internal R&D, production and marketing              
              activities.                                                                    
                   As such, data on aggregate investments in infratechnology                 
              could represent an important new indicator of the Nation's                     
              technological advancement.  This project thereby could contribute              
              to the Foundation's responsibility to provide for the collection               
              and interpretation of data on scientific and engineering                       
              resources.
