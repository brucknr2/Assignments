Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Cardiovascular disorders, such as hypertension, afflicts                  
              approximately 20% of the adult population, and is the prime cause              
              of congestive heart failure, stroke and renal diseased.  The                   
              understanding of the development of hypertension is most adults                
              remains obscure but the research has centered mainly around                    
              measurements of hormones within the blood stream.  Angiotensin II              
              is a neuropeptide hormone that elicits a reproducible complex of               
              behavioral, cardiovascular, neurologic and endocrine responses                 
              when injected into the brain.  Given its major influence on the                
              regulation of blood pressure, it has been suggested that abnormal              
              regulation of angiotensin II in the brain might be etiologic in                
              the development of hypertensin.  Dr. Kalinyak will examine the                 
              sight of synthesis of this peptide and determine its effects on                
              neuronal activity.  Her preliminary data indicate that non-                    
              neuronal cells of the brain, the glial cells, produce the                      
              angiotensin II and the research planning grant will allow to                   
              explore this possibility using cell culture systems.  This work                
              will help clarify the function of neuropeptides in glial cells                 
              and neurons.  Moreover, it could lead to a better understanding                
              of the importance of brain angiotensin in the development of                   
              hypertension in adults.
