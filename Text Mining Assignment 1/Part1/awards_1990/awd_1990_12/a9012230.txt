Abstract    :
                   The project is aimed at the theoretical development and                   
              experimental verification of constitutive models for porous                    
              viscoplastic materials that will be useful in assessing the effect             
              of porosity on localized deformation.  Such constitutive models                
              will lead to the development of improved tools for computer                    
              simulation of deformation processing of metallic materials.
