Abstract    :
              Professor Hull is engaged in an investigation of two separate                  
              projects:  the first concerns criteria for selection of taxonomic              
              principles; the second concerns the processes by which science                 
              itself develops.  While seemingly unrelated, Professor Hull is                 
              using the first study as a case for exemplifying his arguments                 
              concerning the processes of scientific development.                            
                                                                                             
              Although the distance between alternative principles of biological             
              classification and anything that might be considered "evidence" for            
              them is great, empirical considerations can be brought to bear on              
              the decision to choose one set of principles of classification over            
              others.  Professor Hull argues that the taxonomic principles that              
              result in classifications that facilitate the discovery of natural             
              regularities are preferable to those that do not facilitate such               
              discoveries.  Dr Hull is examining the recent literature in                    
              evolutionary biology to see what sorts of classification aid either            
              phylogenetic reconstruction or the discovery of regularities in the            
              evolutionary process.  The results of these investigations will in             
              turn be used to support the contention that the use that scientists            
              make of each others work is central to the ongoing process of                  
              science.
