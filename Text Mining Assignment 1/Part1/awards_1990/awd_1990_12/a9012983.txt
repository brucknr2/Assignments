Abstract    :
              The author of this SGER Proposal aims to synthesize and                        
              characterize a new class of laser materials for the visible and                
              near infrared spectral region.  The solid-state synthesis of                   
              compounds consisting of reduced rare earth metal phosphates will               
              be pursued, with the emphasis of this effort on the lower valent               
              rare earth metal cations such as scandium and yttrium in an oxo-               
              type phosphate anion framework.  Growing single crystals and                   
              characterizing new phases by techniques such as powder or single               
              crystal x-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, differential                 
              thermal analysis, magnetic susceptability, photoelectron                       
              spectroscopy and high resolution electron microscopy will be done              
              with equipment presently aailable for this project at Rice                     
              University.  The exploratory synthesis of new classes of                       
              compounds with unusual oxidation states and coordination is a                  
              rapidly emerging area that is providing new materials or                       
              important "hot technology" areas such as magnetism and new laser               
              materials exhibiting sharp fluorescent lines, strong absorption                
              bands, and high quantum efficiencies.
