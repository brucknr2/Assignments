Abstract    :
              The initiative to map and sequence the human genome is entering a              
              critical period.  For the next five years, the organizational                  
              structures for accomplishing its goal of obtaining the complete                
              sequence by the year 2005.  The choices made in the early 1990's               
              will define the basic outline of the technological system for                  
              mapping and sequencing the human genome.  This period is thus a                
              strategic research opportunity of exceptional importance for                   
              understanding the evolution of the genome project, with a more                 
              general significance for sociology and history of science and                  
              technology.  Dr. Hilgartner is undertaking a study of how the                  
              agenda for research, for organizational design, and for policy of              
              the genomics community takes shape during this critical period.                
              The system/network approach to technology, and the concept of                  
              agenda-setting, provide a theoretical framework.   The research                
              will use a prospective, longitudinal study of a cohort of key                  
              informants from the community, in-depth interviewing, and                      
              participant observation in carefully selected laboratories.
