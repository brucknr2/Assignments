Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study various aspects of                  
              Lagrangian submanifolds in symplectic geometry.  This will                     
              involve an analysis of the relationship between symplectic                     
              structures and the Riemannian structure of Kahler manifolds.                   
              This investigation will include, as a model case, the study of                 
              minimal submanifolds and their mean curvature evolutions.                      
                   Symplectic geometry has a long history of success as a                    
              framework in which difficult questions in mechanics can be                     
              formulated and solved.  The principal investigator will use                    
              connections between this theory and complex Kahler manifolds                   
              especially as related to minimal submanifolds.  Such surfaces are              
              modeled by soap films and have been the objects of intense                     
              mathematical research in recent years.
