Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Efforts to model the equable global climate during Paleogene                   
              times (~66-35 Ma) are hampered by a lack of detail in our                      
              knowledge of temperature patterns and ocean circulation during                 
              this interval.  Drs. Zachos and Lohmann at the Univ. of                        
              Michigan and their colleague Dr. Stott at Univ. of S. Calif.                   
              have been awarded funds to analyze samples from 21 DSDP and ODP                
              sites from three time slices during this interval.  They will                  
              measure delta O18 and delata C13 values in planktonic and                      
              benthic forams to establish sea surface temperatures, thermal                  
              structure of the mixed layer/thermocline, and intermediate                     
              water characteristics.  Age control will be based on integrated                
              bio- and Sr-isotope stratigraphies.  They intend to reconstruct                
              latitudinal temperature gradients from these locations across                  
              the Indian and adjacent Southern Ocean, and will evaluate the                  
              hypothesis that deep-ocean circulation during the Paleogene was                
              driven by salinity gradients created by especially intense                     
              low-latitude evaporation.
