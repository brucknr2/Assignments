Abstract    :
              In this project, the P.I. will continue, and complete studies of               
              low frequency and mesoscale variability in the eastern equatorial              
              Pacific, using data collected during three major projects related              
              to the Tropical Ocean / Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program:  EPOCS,              
              Tropic Heat, and the Hawaii/Tahiti shuttle experiment.  Specific               
              focus will be on the equatorial undercurrent, eddy energetics, and             
              twenty-day waves.
