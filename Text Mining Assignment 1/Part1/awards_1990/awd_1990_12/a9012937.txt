Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research program aims to study a number of                        
              transport processes in two-phase materials using a variety of                  
              theoretical techniques.  Example of problems to be                             
              investigated include the effect of polydispersity on: (1) the                  
              thermocapillary migration of drops and bubbles in a gravity-                   
              free environment; 2) the effective shear viscosity of                          
              suspensions, and 3) the permeability of a packed bed.                          
              Calculations will be performed using both exact solutions,                     
              which are limited in their validity to small particle                          
              concentrations, as well as the effective medium technique                      
              developed by one of the PI's.  In addition, an attempt will be                 
              made to place this method on a firmer foundation and to extend                 
              its scope so as to determine the pair probability function in                  
              flowing suspensions.  Finally, it is proposed to develop a                     
              general kinetic model for computing the variation of the                       
              particle distribution functions in flowing suspensions.
