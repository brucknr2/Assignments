Abstract    :
              The resolution of structure and function within pelagic food webs              
              requires the use of appropriate techniques and equipment.                      
              Gelatinous zooplankton are targeted in this proposal as they                   
              represent a poorly studied but ecologically important fauna                    
              throughout the oceanic water column. Due to their delicate                     
              nature, the metabolism of most soft-bodied zooplankton can only                
              be investigated in their natural environment and it is                         
              hypothesized that in situ measurements of oxygen consumption will              
              lead to reduced errors associated with animal handling, pressure               
              and temperature changes, and light shock.  Data obtained in situ               
              will be used to quantify the contribution of gelatinous                        
              zooplankton to the energetics of midwater communities.                         
              Furthermore, comparisons of this information with similar                      
              metabolic data on crustaceans and fishes will provide an                       
              important counterpoint and permit a better understanding of                    
              selective pressures in the deep sea.
