Abstract    :
              In this project, the P.I.'s will analyze and model an extensive                
              set of Current Meter, Hydrographic, Acoustic Doppler Current                   
              Profiler, Drifter, and Meteorological data from the Gulf of                    
              Alaska, collected from eight cruises over a period of three years.             
              Objectives are to describe and understand seasonal and interannual             
              variability of the Northeast Pacific Ocean circulation.
