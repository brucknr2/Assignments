Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project supports participation by eight                     
              U.S. scientists and engineers in the Six National Power                        
              Systems Symposium to be held in Bombay, India, June 4-7,                       
              1990.  The Symposium is organized by the Indian Institute of                   
              Technology, Bombay, and jointly sponsored by the Maharashta                    
              State Electricity Board and the Indira Gandhi Institute of                     
              Development Research as well as the Central Power Research                     
              Institute in Bangalore.  The conference theme is Power                         
              Systems for the year 2000.  It is expected to be widely                        
              attended by scientists, engineers, consultants and                             
              manufacturing representatives from India, and by academicians                  
              and scientists from around the world.  Major topics to be                      
              covered include large power systems, control systems, and                      
              decentralized systems.  The conference will be cocurrent with                  
              a tutorial symposium to be given by invited experts from the                   
              U.S and other countries.                                                       
              Scope:  India is embarking on a large expansion of its power                   
              network, with an increase from 60 Million kilowatt (KW)                        
              capacity to about 200 million KW within the next 25 years.                     
              For India, as well as for most developing countries the focus                  
              in this growth is expected to be on energy conservation,                       
              environmental consideration as well as reliability.  Sources                   
              for fuel, both renewable and nonrenewable, have to be                          
              considered.  The proposed conference provides a forum for                      
              discussions and exchange of information on the important                       
              issues related to the planning, design, construction,                          
              operation and maintenance of electric power systems.  It is                    
              likely that the conference will identify specific scientific                   
              problems that may be of particular importance to India, and                    
              other LDC's, as well as to the U.S.
