Abstract    :
              This is a two-year collaborative research project between                      
              Drs. Russell Elsberry, Chih-Pei Chang, Roger Williams, and                     
              Malinda Peng, Naval Postgraduate School, and Professors C.                     
              Y. Tsay and George Chen, National Taiwan University supported                  
              by the AIT-CCNAA Cooperative Science Program.  This proposal                   
              plans to study the behavior and properties of typhoons in                      
              the vicinity of Taiwan using the data collected by the                         
              Western Pacific Tropical Cyclone Motion Field Experiment                       
              (TCM) sponsored by the Office of Naval Research.  The TCM                      
              experiment collected extensive data on large-scale air flow                    
              associated with typhoons in the western Pacific.  The U.S.                     
              scientists involved in this study are leaders in this field                    
              and plan to use the collected data to develop models of                        
              tropical cyclones.  This project is useful to the U.S.                         
              meteorological communities and can provide an important                        
              understanding of the behavior and properties of typhoons in                    
              the western Pacific.  This project is jointly supported by                     
              the NSF and the Taiwan National Science Council.
