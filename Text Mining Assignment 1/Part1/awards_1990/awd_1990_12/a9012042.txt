Abstract    :
                Pennsylvania State University will establish a Center for                    
              Undergraduate Research Opportunities (CURO) to provide research                
              experiences for minority engineering students during their                     
              undergraduate years.  The Center will be a component of the existing           
              Minority Engineering Program (MEP) in the College of Engineering.              
              CURO will begin operations with 20 minority engineering or science             
              students selected as research scholars.  These students will be                
              appointed to work with faculty and staff in research units                     
              (laboratories or centers) within the College of Engineering, or                
              participating interdisciplinary research units within the University.          
              The appointments will be for a period of two academic semesters, or            
              for the summer session.  Twenty-five research units with the                   
              University have agreed to participate in this project initially.  The          
              students will be required to take a course in "Research Methodology"           
              to get training in the conduct of research.  The research faculty and          
              staff will be provided with an orientation course on cultural                  
              diversity to improve their skills for interacting closely with                 
              students of diverse backgrounds.  At the end of the appointment period         
              each student will be required to make a "Report of Research Activity."         
              Over a five year period the Center proposes to support a total of 120          
              minority engineering and science students as undergraduate research            
              scholars.  After this period, the Center for Undergraduate Research            
              Opportunities for Minority Engineering Students will become an                 
              integral part of the participating research units with the University          
              and the Minority Engineering Program.
