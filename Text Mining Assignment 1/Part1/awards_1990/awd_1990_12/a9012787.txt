Abstract    :
              The work in the preceding grant                                                
              period demonstrated the utility of the                                         
              single-arm fiber interferometer as an                                          
              all optical switch.  It led to an all                                          
              optical switch of unprecedented low                                            
              switchout power with no stabilization                                          
              of the interferometer.  The fiber-ring                                         
              reflector has similarly stable                                                 
              performance that needs no external                                             
              stabilization.  The use of the ring                                            
              reflector with a 42% /68% coupler as                                           
              an optical switch was first                                                    
              demonstrated by the research group                                             
              at British Telecom.  The Principle                                             
              Investigator has shown that an                                                 
              improved version of the ring reflector                                         
              can be devised if the 50% / 50%                                                
              beam splitter is used.  Further, a very                                        
              simple version of such a reflector is a                                        
              means for producing pulsed squeezed                                            
              optical vacuum in a way that separates                                         
              the pumping radiation from the                                                 
              squeezed radiation.  The P.I. proposes                                         
              to concentrate upon various aspects of                                         
              switching and squeezing of this fiber                                          
              ring interferometer, generically                                               
              equivalent to the single fiber                                                 
              interferometer, but easier to construct                                        
              and therefore preferable for                                                   
              experimentation.  He proposes to                                               
              develop further the quantum theory of                                          
              solitons.  Finally, he proposes to                                             
              investigate the two photon absorption                                          
              in silica fibers that may, or may not,                                         
              affect the switching properties of                                             
              optical fibers.
