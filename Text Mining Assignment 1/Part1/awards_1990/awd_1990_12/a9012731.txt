Abstract    :
                   Numerical linear algebra has several important applications               
              in a wide variety of scientific and engineering applications.                  
                   The generalized eigenvalue problem, Kx= lamda Mx, is of                   
              significant practical importance, especially in structural                     
              engineering where it arises as the vibration and buckling                      
              problem.  New software, LANZ, based on Lanczos' method is being                
              developed for solving these problems.  LANZ uses a technique                   
              called dynamic shifting to improve the efficiency and reliability              
              of the Lanczos algorithm.  Improved method for solving symmetric               
              indefinite linear systems and for finding eigenvalues of the                   
              tridiagonal matrices that arise when using Lanczos' method are                 
              being studied.  A modification of Parlett and Scott's selective                
              orthogonalization algorithm is being tested.  Implementations of               
              LANZ on a Convex C-220, Cray 2 and Cray Y-MP are being used to                 
              study the performance of the improved method and compare it with               
              a subspace iteration code used by structural engineers.  Research              
              leading to an efficient, robust implementation of LANZ on MIMD                 
              parallel systems with a large number of processors is proposed.
