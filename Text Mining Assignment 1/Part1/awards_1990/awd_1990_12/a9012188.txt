Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Obtaining the ages of the basalts in mid-ocean                            
              ridge neovolcanic zones has been a vexing problem. The                         
              principal investigator will develop a radiometric technique that               
              uses observed disequilibrium between Ra226 and its parent Th230                
              to determine the ages of yound mid-ocean ridge basalts less than               
              about 8000 years old. The usual approach in geochronology is                   
              ton moralize concentrations of the daughter isotope to a stable                
              or very long-lived isotope of the same element since it is                     
              of ten possible to estimate initial ratios more accurately                     
              than concentrations. Since Ra226 is the longest-lived radium                   
              isotope and Ra has no stable isotope, Ba will be used as the                   
              reference. Ra and Ba are alkaline earth elements with large ionic              
              radii and +2 oxidation state and are expected to act similarly                 
              during chemical fractionation associated with magma genesis.                   
              Thus, the ratio Ba/Th in the source must be essentially constant               
              for the suite of rocks being dated.
