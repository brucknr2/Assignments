Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Propose to use the PICES submersible to sample the flanks of                   
              the Liohi and Mahukona volcano in order to study the petrology                 
              and geochemistry of this endmember in the Hawaii volcano chain.                
              They wish to test a hypothesis that a period of alkalic                        
              volcanism preceded the current period of coeval tholeiitic and                 
              alkalic volcanism. Recovered rocks will be characterized with                  
              petrography and mineral and glass chemistry. The glasses will                  
              be analyzed for major and trace elements. For selected samples                 
              Pb, Sr, Nd, and O isotopes will be determined to evaluate the                  
              history and source of these lavas.
