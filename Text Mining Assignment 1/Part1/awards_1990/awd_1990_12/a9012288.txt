Abstract    :
              This work is concerned with the development of a prescriptive type             
              system for logic programs, i.e., one in which types are explicitly             
              declared by the programmer.  The system is quite expressive in that it         
              supports parametric polymorphism, subtypes, and a new notion called            
              bipartisan predicate types that facilitates the use of subtypes.               
              These features make it possible to impose types on a wide range of             
              realistic Prolog programs.  The research includes the development of           
              the theoretical foundations of the system, the design and                      
              implementation of type checking and inferencing algorithms, and the            
              application of the system to compile-time optimization, in                     
              particular, to current NSF-supported work on the automatic                     
              parallelization of logic programs.  The work is intended to impact             
              both software development technology and compiler technology.
