Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A major finding 15 years ago was that various                             
              oceanographic parameters respond to orbital ("Milankovich")                    
              forcings in a linear manner. This means that 1) marine                         
              sediments faithfully record the frequencies of orbital                         
              patterns, shifted only in amplitude and phase; 2) interaction                  
              of the several known orbital frequencies results in marine                     
              patterns that are the sum of all these frequencies. The P.I.                   
              has recently discovered that Pliocene sediments from the                       
              eastern equatorial Pacific (DSDP) Site 572) show non-linear                    
              couplings to the Milankovich band. This means that the marinere                
              cord shows evidence of: 1) harmonic distortion, i.e. orbital                   
              frequency fO is recorded at fO,2fO,3fO, etc,; 2)                               
              intermodulation distortion, i.e. various orbital frequencies                   
              both add and subtract to give a complex array of frequencies in                
              the marine record.                                                             
                   Funds have been awarded to expand this search for non-                    
              linear responses. Because commonly used techniques of time                     
              series analysis cannot detect anything other than linear                       
              response signals, bispectrum analysis and auto regressive                      
              moving average models will be explored as alternative                          
              techniques. Sensitivity studies will be conducted,                             
              and the final techniques will be applied to the analysis of any                
              of several candidate ODP and DSDP records, using delta O18,                    
              delta C13, CaCO3, SST, eolian dust of magnetic susceptibility                  
              as the parameter to examine for orbital forcings.
