Abstract    :
              The most widely used methods of high-resolution marine                         
              stratigraphy rely on the record of changes in delta-018,                       
              paleontology or paleomagnetics.  Unfortunately, these techniques               
              are limited to sediments either rich in carbonate- or silica-                  
              bearing fossils, or from magnetically oriented cores.  Dr.                     
              Herbert will develop techniques for using GRAPE (Gamma Ray                     
              Attenuation Porosity Evaluator) bulk density measurements to                   
              identify orbital frequencies in 5 DSDP and ODP cores from the                  
              equatorial eastern Pacific.  These "Milankovitch" signals are                  
              known within 2% precision back through the Neogene, and the                    
              author intends to "tune" the sedimentation rates to fit these                  
              frequencies.  Preliminary work has shaon that a "moving window"                
              scheme will result in 5% precision and 100 Kyr resolution of                   
              sedimentation rates back to 17 MY.  As this is a developmental                 
              experiment, he proposes several validation checks against                      
              existing biostratigraphy and paleomagnetic calibrations, as well               
              as inter-site consistency checks.  If found to be valid, this                  
              technique will not only provide much improved chronologies at                  
              these and other cores, but will also:  1) make possible equally                
              improved mass accumulation rate estimates for CaCO3, Corg, SiO2,               
              and aeolian dust;  2) provide the first chance of finding                      
              paleoceanographic periodicities longer than 500 Kyrs;  and 3)                  
              lead to better understanding of the mean and variance of orbital               
              forcings back to 17 MY.
