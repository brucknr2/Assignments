Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research award will support a cultural                       
              anthropologist studying the reaction of working-class townspeople              
              in Palermo, Sicily to immigrant laborers from the third world.                 
              The racial stereotyping by Sicilians of "people of color" will be              
              compared with their own understanding of bias directed against                 
              Sicilian immigrants to Northern Italy and elsewhere.  The methods              
              include participant observation in a working class neighborhood,               
              interviews with union officials and a sample of workers, as well               
              as a structured questionnaire distributed to neighborhood                      
              residents.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This research is important because migrant laborers are common in              
              many societies in the world.  Increased understanding of the                   
              causes of anti-migrant bias, especially as expressed in racial                 
              terms, will help policy makers deal with these problems.
