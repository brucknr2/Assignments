Abstract    :
              This is an investigation of the  mechanics of ridge faulting.                  
              The Principal Investigators will develop lithospheric deformation              
              models that explicitly consider faulting processes on a set of                 
              discrete faults.  Three phases of the investigation are: (1)  to               
              examine the basic mechanics of a single normal fault under ridge               
              tectonic stresses and subsequent lithospheric deformation, (2)                 
              to investigate the mechanical interaction among multiple faults                
              in the crust and its effects on faulting patterns near a mid-                  
              ocean ridge, and (3)  to apply the theoretical results from phase              
              1 and 2 to determine the characteristics of faulting in well                   
              surveyed areas of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  The objectives of                   
              studying a multiply-faulted system are to test the hypothesis                  
              that the close spacing of near-ridge faults os the result of                   
              mechanical interactions between faults, and that the width of the              
              rift valley at a slow-spareding ridge is controlled by the                     
              thickness of the lithospheric plate.
