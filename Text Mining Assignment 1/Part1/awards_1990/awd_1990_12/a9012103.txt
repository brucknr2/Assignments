Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The processes controlling the fate of particle-reactive U/Th                   
              decay series isotopes in the oceans must be fully understood in                
              order to ascertain their usefulness as tracers for particle                    
              dynamics.  Thorium kinetic and equilibrium behavior appears to                 
              be the consequence of a combination of physical (particle-                     
              particle interactions) and chemical (adsorption) processes.  A                 
              colloidal pumping hypothesis stating that Th isotopes are                      
              transferred from the dissolved state to macroparticles via a                   
              colloidal will be tested.  Research suggests that Th                           
              "scavenging" rates most likely represent the rate of                           
              coagulation of submicron particles with a large-particle pool                  
              rather than Th sorption itself.  Laboratory experiments will                   
              use inorganic and organic model particles in order to further                  
              test and simulate the proposed coupling of sorption and                        
              coagulation processes.  Field experiments will test the oceanic                
              scavenging model under experimentally constrained conditions to                
              better understand the applicability of results from laboratory                 
              studies to natural environments.
