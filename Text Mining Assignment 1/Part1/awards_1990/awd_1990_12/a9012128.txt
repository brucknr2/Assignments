Abstract    :
              This project examines a variety of dynamic problems in public                  
              finance, macroeconomics and industrial organization.  In tax theory            
              the project determines the characteristics of optimal taxation of              
              capital and labor income, using nonlinear numerical techniques, and            
              incorporating reasonable restrictions on government behavior.  It              
              also computes the political outcomes if governments cannot                     
              precommit to optimal policies.  In industrial organization the                 
              project examines a dynamic model of oligopoly which allows firms               
              to choose both quantities and prices, essentially merging the                  
              Bertrand and Cournot models.  The dynamic model is used to examine             
              the strategic importance of investment, learning, signalling and               
              the incentives for merger.  The project also develops numerical                
              techniques which are necessary to examines these dynamic problems              
              with general specifications of demand and supply.                              
                                                                                             
              The research on tax policy is especially timely and important.                 
              The investigator's past work demonstrated that there are                       
              substantial differences between the results obtained from                      
              standard tax analysis and results from truly dynamic and                       
              stochastic models.  This project establishes the robustness of the             
              theoretical results by developing more realistic models. The loss              
              due to nonoptimal rules is determined by comparing the optimal                 
              policy with alternatives.
