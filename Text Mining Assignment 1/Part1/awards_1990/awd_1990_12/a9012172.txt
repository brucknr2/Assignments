Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     Based on observations in the modern ocean, it ishypothesized           
              that lower glacial ocean CO2 (aq) now evident fromVostok ice core              
              data will be expressed as significantly highersediment delta C13               
              (org) values in glacial.age strata. Thishypothesis will be tested            
              by carefully selecting and analyzingmaterial from appropriate                  
              horizons within archived sedimentcores. The cores to be used will              
              be representative of either theequatorial or the                               
              high.southern.latitude Atlantic Ocean, and willhave undergone              
              previous study with respect to geochronology andpaleoceanography.              
              Core material will be selected to documentisotopic abundances                  
              within late Quaternary interglacial andglacial periods, with                   
              special attention to the transitions.
