Abstract    :
              In this project, the P.I. will study the vertical transport of                 
              momentum by internal waves through turbulent mixing processes in a             
              region with large mean vertical shear, using a numerical model.                
              The results will directly address the mechanism for transporting               
              large shear stresses, which might be generated by wind at the                  
              surface, in a stably stratified and sheared ocean, such as the                 
              equatorial Pacific, in which there is relatively small local                   
              dissipation of mechanical energy.  Particular application will be              
              to the P.I.'s extensive data set from the equatorial Pacific which             
              motivated this study.
