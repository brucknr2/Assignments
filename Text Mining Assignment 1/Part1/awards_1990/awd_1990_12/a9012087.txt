Abstract    :
              Dr. Hirsh is analyzing the changes in values and motivations that              
              contributed in recent years to the restructuring of the American               
              electric utility industry.  Taking an historical and humanistic                
              perspective, he is paying particular attention to evolving                     
              attitudes of individuals in the regulatory community--attitudes                
              that have been forced to change due to a variety of influences.                
              Technological change has been one of these influences, though it               
              has been poorly understood. As technology used in the industry                 
              began stagnating in the 1960s and 1970s, ending an 80 year trend               
              of continuous improvement and declining unit costs, regulators                 
              started questioning the rationale for the utility industry's status            
              as a "natural monopoly."  At the same time, regulators' values and             
              perceptions were influenced by novel economic theories and passage             
              in 1978 of new legislation that stimulated technological innovation            
              for use by non-utility generators.  The questioning by regulators              
              of whether regulated natural electric utility monopolies were still            
              "in the public interest" has recently been translated into partial             
              deregulation of the industry.  Additionally, this work will address            
              the issue of how regulators' new values have been converted into               
              novel incentives for technological innovation and how these                    
              incentives contribute to a restructuring movement that will                    
              continue into the 1990s and beyond.                                            
                                                                                             
              Dr. Hirsh's aim is to produce a study detailing the social,                    
              intellectual, and technical origins of a restructured utility                  
              industry.  The work will transcend political and economic                      
              discussions and provide original perspectives to historians of                 
              technology, industry managers and public policy makers.  It will               
              also serve an immediate need of managers and policy analysts by                
              offering a better understanding of participants' motivations as a              
              vital industry undergoes wrenching changes.
