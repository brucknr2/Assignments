Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Understanding the history of global sea level changes                          
              has relevance to a wide range of studies in earth sciences.                    
              Along with a former graduate student and his colleague Dr.                     
              Joann Stock at Harvard, Dr. Molnar proposes to conduct                         
              indirect measurements of sea level back to 84 Ma, estimate the                 
              errors involved in the technique, and with these constrained                   
              ranges of values, prepare interpretations regarding the effects                
              on past climate, global heat flux and sea floor spreading rates.               
              The technique requires calculating the mean age and area of                    
              the ocean floor at discrete times in the past.  Both                           
              calculations require plate reconstructions based on marine                     
              magnetic anomalies, and this work has been done over the last                  
              several years by Molnar and Stock.  From these reconstructions,                
              and from an empirical relationship between seafloor age and                    
              depth,"mean depths" can be estimated.  Based on the                            
              plate configurations and knowledge of continental                              
              histories, palinspastic reconstructions of continental                         
              lithosphere will provide estimates of the areas of ocean basins.               
              These calculations were done during thesis research by Jose Rosa               
              at 35 and 59 Ma, where he found that sea level was 72 .26 m and              
              173 .56 m above present, respectively.  The present award                    
              will allow Rosa to continue this work with Stock, and to complete              
              similar analyses at 11, 20, 42, 49, 69, and 84 Ma.  While similar              
              work has been done by others (e.g. Kominz, 1984), the precision                
              of his plate reconstructions, his proposed error analysis, and                 
              the estimates he will make concerning the effects of 1)                        
              seamounts, 2) hot-spot swells, and 3) sediment displacement of                 
              ocean water, will result in the most tightly constrained set of                
              sea level estimates yet made.
