Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This work studies non-monotonic logics and their application to                
              common sense reasoning about knowledge and belief.  It addresses               
              both theoretical and algorithmic issues of non-monotonic modal                 
              logic.  The results will increase understanding of non-                        
              monotonicity and will be applicable to non-modal formalism of                  
              non-monotic reasoning such as default logic, logic programming,                
              and truth maintenance systems.
