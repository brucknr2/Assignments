Abstract    :
              In this project, the Scripps Satellite Oceanography Center will                
              re-archive AVHRR data from the west coast time series from                     
              magnetic tape to magneto-optical discs, in order to prevent loss               
              of the data to the community due to aging of magnetic tape.  In                
              addition, a user-friendly online browse system and automated                   
              ordering system will be installed.
