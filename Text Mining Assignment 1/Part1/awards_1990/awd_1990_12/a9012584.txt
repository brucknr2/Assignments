Abstract    :
              The project continues empirical work concerning the dynamics of                
              relative wages. Wage inequality within groups classified by                    
              gender, age and education increased enormously during the 1970s                
              and 1980s. Relative wage differentials between groups increased                
              during the 1980s, although patterns for the 1970s are mixed. The               
              rise in returns to a college degree since 1979 and the rose in                 
              overall male wage inequality since the late 1960s are two of the               
              most important examples of changing relative wages. Previous work              
              suggests that changes in age and school completion distributions               
              associated with the job market entry of the baby boom cohorts                  
              affected wages between groups. After accounting for such effects,              
              the data show a consistent picture of rising skill differential.               
                                                                                             
              The three major tasks involve an effort to distinguish between                 
              alternative explanations. The first task is to generate                        
              additional evidence on relative wage patterns by extending the                 
              previous analysis to include females, male/female differentials,               
              to decompose changes into permanent and temporary components, and              
              to attempt to identify those skills that have become more                      
              valuable. A second major task is to examine the effects on wage                
              inequality of generalized and sector-specific demand shifts. The               
              third major task includes an extension from wages per se to the                
              interaction between wages and labor force participation. The                   
              familiar trends towards decreased participation of men and                     
              increased participation of women are coincident with wage changes              
              that support traditional notions of positively inclined labor                  
              supply functions. The analysis will be based on a supply and                   
              demand framework. Several major data sets will be used in the                  
              various subparts of the study - the Current Population Survey,                 
              the Panel Survey on Income Dynamics and the National                           
              Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
