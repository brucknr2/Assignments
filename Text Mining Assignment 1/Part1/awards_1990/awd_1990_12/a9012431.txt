Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will use the DSRV ALVIN to directly study the                     
              dynamics of turbulent buoyant plumes emanating from active                     
              hydrothermal vents. The aim of the project is to provide a sound               
              basis for relating water-comumn measurements of the effluent                   
              plumes to the thermal output of the underlying oceanic crust. The              
              PI's propose to mount an instrument package on ALVIN that will                 
              measure temperature, conductivity (salinity), vertical and                     
              horizontal velocity, light attenuation (particledensity), and                  
              concentrations of manganese, silica, and sulfidein real time via               
              in situ flow injection analysis. The instrument will also collect              
              discrete water samples for laboratory analyses. Data and water                 
              samples will be collected in real time shile driving ALVIN                     
              through buoyant hydrothermal plumes at several heights in the                  
              water column. Undiluted hydrothermal source fluids and the                     
              surrounding water column will also be studied. Specific                        
              objectives incluse: (1) characterization of vertical and lateral               
              variation in physical properties, velocities, chemical                         
              concentrations, and suspended particles within the buoyant plume,              
              (2) quantification of entrainment and dilution rates as function               
              of plume height, (3) determine turbulent variability in the                    
              buoyant                                                                        
              plume and relate to property variations, and (5) testing                       
              numerical plume models against field measurements.
