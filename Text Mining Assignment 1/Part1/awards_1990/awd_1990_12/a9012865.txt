Abstract    :
              Professor Bernstein is analyzing major issues involving scientists             
              (mostly physicists) and nuclear-weapons policy.  These issues                  
              include radiological weapons, 1941-54; the development of tactical             
              nuclear weapons, 1943-54; and the quest for the H-bomb, 1942-54,               
              including the establishment of Livermore Lab and the 1952 and 1954             
              efforts to secure a test-ban.  In this study, Professor Bernstein              
              is examining the roles of leading scientists in weapons and defense            
              policy:  their thinking about the development, deployment, and use             
              of weapons; their efforts to slow, redirect, or propel the buildup             
              of the nuclear arsenal; their actual influence on weapons policy;              
              their relationship to the military and AEC funding; and these                  
              scientists' beliefs about the ethical responsibilities of                      
              scientists.  This research is partly an effort to understand the               
              rise of the defense scientists by studying their activities, in                
              depth, in the development of these weapons.                                    
                                                                                             
              This research has grown out of Professor Bernstein's earlier work              
              on World War II and postwar policy.  The study is based heavily on             
              archival research in over 45 collections, and also on use of oral              
              histories and on interviews or correspondence with over 20                     
              scientists.
