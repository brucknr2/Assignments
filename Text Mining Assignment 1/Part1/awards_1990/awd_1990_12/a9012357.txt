Abstract    :
              This project has three parts.  Part one consists in developing new             
              parallel graph algorithms that are efficient in their use of                   
              processors.  The focus is on developing algorithmic building blocks            
              that are useful in combinatorial optimization, e.g. shortest paths.            
              Part two consists in obtaining new approximation algorithms for                
              problems that are too difficult to solve exactly.  Two such problems           
              are finding a minimum-weight collection of edges in a graph whose              
              deletion yields a planar graph, and finding a minimum number of edges          
              to add to a graph to make it chordal.  The first problem arises in             
              planning the layout of a manufacturing facility, the second problem in         
              solving sparse linear systems and linear programs.  Part three                 
              consists in developing improved algorithms for variants of                     
              multicommodity flow, a problem that arises in the above approximation          
              algorithms as well as in a variety of network analysis problems.
