Abstract    :
                   Two problems regarding slow shocks in the solar wind will be              
              studied.  The first deals with the formation of shocks associated              
              with coronal mass ejections (CME).  Under various coronal                      
              conditions, it should be possible to learn from the formation                  
              process about the nature of CME associated shocks, whether they                
              are slow shocks, fast shocks, or a combination of both. It will                
              be shown that the nature of the shocks and the shock strengths                 
              are functions of a dimensionless momentum impact parameter lamda,              
              the plasma beta value and the shock angle theta. The next step                 
              will be a systematic study of MHD shocks in the lamda, beta,                   
              theta space using a planar shock geometry.  The final step will                
              be a study of the formation of MHD shocks with curved shock                    
              geometries.                                                                    
                   The second problem concerns the three dimensional slow shock              
              reconnection process.  The third dimension of the model adds a                 
              new degree of freedom to the flow system, such that it is                      
              possible to obtain exact numerical solutions to the MHD equations              
              for the slow shock reconnection.  The existence of exact                       
              solutions means that the reconnection configuration is consistent              
              with the governing equations of magnetohydrodynamics, and from                 
              the exact solutions, one can derive quantitative relationships                 
              among various parameters such as the rate of reconnection, the                 
              plasma beta value, etc. ***
