Abstract    :
              This is a study of electrogenerative processes, i. e.                          
              processes for producing chemical products with byproduct                       
              electric power.  The emphasis in this study is on electrodes                   
              for electrogenerative processing of substrates dissolved in a                  
              liquid phase.  Methods for formulating and preparing the                       
              requisite electrocatalysts to optimize the selectivity are                     
              investigated.  Selected processes include integrated flue-gas                  
              teatment in which sulfur dioxide is converted to sulfuric                      
              acid and nitric oxide is converted to ammonia or                               
              hydroxylamine; processing of biomass to convert alcohols to                    
              aldehydes and ketones; and "galvanic cementation" to recover                   
              metals such as copper and tin from waste streams.                              
                                                                                             
              Electrogenerative proceses are fundamentally attractive                        
              because they capture the energy released in the chemical                       
              process (which would traditionally be released as wasted heat)                 
              in a form that can be readily transported and reused.  In                      
              addition the three processes at the center of this study all                   
              use bothersome environmental pollutants as raw materials.                      
              These processes should be advantageous from perspectives of                    
              cost, energy conservation, and environmental protection.
