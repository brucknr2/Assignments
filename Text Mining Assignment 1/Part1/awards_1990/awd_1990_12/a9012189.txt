Abstract    :
              With the development of complex information systems, the                       
              integration of heterogeneous systems, and the availability of                  
              numerous online computer data sources, it has become increasingly              
              important that methods be developed that consider the meaning of               
              the data used in these systems. For example, it is important that              
              an application requiring financial data in US dollars does not                 
              receive data from a source that reports in another currency.                   
              This problem is further complicated by the fact that the meaning               
              of data may change at any time.  To deal with this problem,                    
              information systems must have the ability to represent data                    
              semantics and detect and automatically resolve semantic                        
              conflicts.  This research focuses on the representation and                    
              manipulation of data semantics (i.e., metadata).  This research                
              develops: (1) a rule-based approach to metadata specification,                 
              (2) query processing techniques that identify semantic conflicts,              
              (3) methods that use conversion routines to automatically resolve              
              these conflicts.  When applied to source-receiver systems, these               
              techniques create a dynamic system environment that permits                    
              changes in data semantics.  Similarly, in heterogeneous                        
              information systems these techniques define a dynamic schema                   
              integration environment where the integrated system can continue               
              to operate as the component systems independently modify data                  
              semantics.
