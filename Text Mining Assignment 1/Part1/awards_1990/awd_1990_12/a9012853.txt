Abstract    :
              This project consists of three parts: (1) the study of perfect                 
              competition in the context of large assignment models; (2) the                 
              development of a general equilibrium model of bankruptcy and                   
              collateral with applications to financial markets; and (3) the                 
              development of an extended notion of equilibrium in extensive form             
              games with continuous action spaces.  This research contributes a              
              powerful new theory of competition, general insights into the                  
              impact of bankruptcy on financial markets and new insights into                
              ways of solving a class of bargaining problems found frequently in             
              economics.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The work on characterizing competition in large assignment problems            
              is especially exciting because it could lead to a new way of                   
              conceptualizing competition that would capture as special cases                
              such widely used criteria as non manipulability of prices and the              
              appropriation of agents' marginal contributions.  The assignment               
              model has a rich history as a laboratory for the development of                
              important new theories such as linear programming and core theory.             
              Past work by the investigator and his collaborators suggests that              
              their study of the uniqueness of equilibrium prices in large                   
              assignment models could provide another new, powerful analytical               
              tool for economic theory.
