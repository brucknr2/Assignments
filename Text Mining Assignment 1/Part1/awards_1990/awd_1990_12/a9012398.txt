Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The function of the nervous systems depends on the signaling of                
              nerve impulses across the nerve cells at a structure called                    
              synapse.  A group of molecules in the membrane of the receiving                
              post-synaptic nerve cells, the transmitter receptors, are                      
              responsible for receiving the chemical signals from the pre-                   
              synaptic nerve cells.  The metabolism, mobility, and the                       
              distribution of these receptors determine the efficiency and                   
              stability of the signaling at the synapse.  The purpose of the                 
              present project is to examine when the glutamate receptors are                 
              synthesized in the developing nerve cells, how do they become                  
              segregated into different regions of the cell membrane, how their              
              distribution at the synapse become concentrated as synapse                     
              matures, and whether the concentrated distribution can be further              
              modified by the use of the synapse.  The result from this study                
              will help us to understand the role of transmitter receptor                    
              dynamics in the synaptic functions as well as in the disease                   
              states, during embryonic development and in adult life.
