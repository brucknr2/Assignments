Abstract    :
              In this project, the P.I.'s will continue development and                      
              application of intermediate models of the gyre-scale ocean                     
              circulation based on the balance equations (BE).  BE contains more             
              dynamics than the quasi-geostrophic (QG) models, but requires                  
              substantially less computer capacity than the primitive equation               
              (PE) models.  Wind and thermal forcing are both included.                      
              Successful adiabatic models will be extended to include diabatic               
              effects of buoyancy and wind forcing, and related sub-grid-scale               
              mixing algorithms.
