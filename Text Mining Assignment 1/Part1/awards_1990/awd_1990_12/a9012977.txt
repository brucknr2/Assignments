Abstract    :
                   This project will support the Societal Institute of the                   
              Mathematical Sciences (SIMS) Steering Committee for the                        
              Mathematical Sciences in the Human Genome Project (HGP).  The                  
              purpose of the Committee is to (1) monitor the rapid developments              
              in the HGP and related fields which particularly concern the                   
              mathematical sciences, (2) make specific recommendations to                    
              appropriate groups, and (3) initiate research/education projects               
              when they seem reasonable or necessary.  The Committee will meet               
              twice per year for the next two and one half years.  In                        
              general, the Committee plans to ensure that issues involving the               
              mathematical sciences are examined with proper attention to all                
              their ramifications, particularly for research and                             
              interdisciplinary training in connection with the HGP.
