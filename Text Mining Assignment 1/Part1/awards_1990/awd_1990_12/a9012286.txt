Abstract    :
              This proposal, submitted through the ROW Planning Grant                        
              initiative, is designed to assist the PI in preparing a                        
              competitive research proposal for the National Science                         
              Foundation.  The topical area of research is the persistence of                
              gender differences in representation in mathematics, science,                  
              and technical fields despite women's progress in educational                   
              attainment.  The PI will explore whether the positive effects                  
              on college attendance and completion of Catholic high school                   
              attendance by girls extend to positive effects on their study                  
              of science and mathematics.  The data base to be used is High                  
              School and Beyond.  The questions to be addressed are:                         
              (1)  What gender differences exist in mathematical and                         
                   scientific educational experiences, as well as in                         
                   attitudes towards these fields, among seniors in 1982?                    
              (2)  Do such gender differences vary by high school type                       
                   (public or Catholic) when individual social background is                 
                   controlled for?                                                           
              (3)  What are the mechanisms through which Catholic high                       
                   schools confer possible advantages or disadvantages to                    
                   their students?                                                           
              (4)  Do different types of Catholic high schools, such as                      
                   single-sex or co-educational schools, have differental                    
                   effects upon the achievements and enrollment patterns of                  
                   women and men in mathematics and science?                                 
                   The PI will use the ROW planning grant to establish                       
              contact with senior advisors well-versed in this type of                       
              research so that she can improve her statistical and                           
              methodological skills, to complete a more thorough review of                   
              the literature, and to prepare her data for the study that she                 
              would then propose for NSF funding.
