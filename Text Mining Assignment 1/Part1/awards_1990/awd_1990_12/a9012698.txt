Abstract    :
                   This "19th Informal Conference on Photochemistry" will be                 
              the next in a long series of conferences that have attracted                   
              international groups of leading research workers in its field.                 
              The conferences have played an important role as media of                      
              exchange of information and ideas among scientists at the                      
              forefront of photochemical research.                                           
                   These biennial conferences attract atmospheric chemists                   
              because they are brought into contact with workers at the                      
              cutting edge of "pure" gas photochemistry. On the other hand,                  
              workers in general photochemistry are made aware of problems                   
              and research opportunities in atmospheric chemistry.  The 19th                 
              Conference will have one full day of atmospheric chemistry                     
              papers.
