Abstract    :
              A theory of judgmental illusions proposed by the investigator in his           
              recent book, "Patterns, Thinking, and Cognition," will be tested               
              experimentally.  The theory claims that people evaluate decision               
              situations by calling to mind familiar scenarios.  Such scenarios are          
              often stored in related pairs in a person's memory. The theory claims          
              that many judgmental errors occur when situational cues summon the             
              inappropriate scenario from the relevant pair.  A series of experiments        
              will be conducted to manipulate the salience of specific scenarios.            
              This work will add to our understanding of the way people make                 
              decisions, and suggest ways of improving decision making by generating         
              clues for how people can select the most appropriate scenario for the          
              current problem situation.
