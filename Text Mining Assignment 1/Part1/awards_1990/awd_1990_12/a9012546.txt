Abstract    :
              The gravity-driven separation of solid particles from a                        
              suspension in tanks with inclined walls and the related                        
              fundamental phenomena are the object of this project.  The                     
              previous model describing the accelerated settling process in                  
              the presence of inclined surfaces fails in low viscosity                       
              fluids.  The reasons are the waves formed along the                            
              suspension-clear fluid interface.  This aspect will be                         
              investigated both experimentally and theoretically.                            
                                                                                             
              This proposal is a continuation of a previous research work                    
              sponsored by NSF, in which Dr. Acrivos has obtained                            
              significant scientific results on two-phase flow mechanisms,                   
              with application to suppersettlers in mineral processing and                   
              waste water treatment.
