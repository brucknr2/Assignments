Abstract    :
              The precise localization of newly discovered proteins and                      
              messenger RNA molecules within cells is of crucial importance for              
                                                                                             
              assigning functions and testing mechanistic hypotheses.  Such                  
              molecules can be visualized by fluorescent and electron-dense                  
              tags using standard techniques, and then need to be imaged in                  
              relation to surrounding structure by microscopy for localization.              
                                                                                             
              The confocal microscope provides the most effective means to do                
              this by light microscopy, allowing complete three dimensional                  
              reconstructions with unprecedented detail.  This instrument will               
                                                                                             
              serve the entire biological community at Princeton, whose                      
              research requires localizations of importance and molecular                    
              biology.  At lest 80% of the 25 faculty in life sciences at                    
              Princeton will be user of both instruments, about 45% being major
