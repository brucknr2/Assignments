Abstract    :
              The companion processes of dewatering and compaction that occur                
              during sediment burial are strongly influenced by sediment                     
              composition and micro-fabric (i.e., grain-to-grain interactions).              
              Improved documentation of these two processes is needed to gain                
              better understanding of fluid flow, accretion, underplating and                
              faulting in subduction zone settings.  Drs. Tribble and Wilkens                
              will extend earlier work from the Barbados accretionary prism to               
              include studies of DSDP/ODP cores from Nankai Trough.  X-ray                   
              diffraction will be used to determine the mineralogy of samples                
              at several locations to develop a uniformly archived data set.                 
              Special emphasis will be placed on determining the abundances and              
              diagenetic alteration of smectite and biogenic silica.                         
              Progressive alteration of volcanic ash to smectite will be                     
              traced.  Microfabric studies will be conducted with both scanning              
              and transmission electron microscopy, with the intention of                    
              quantifying changes in fabric with depth, composition and                      
              tectonic setting.
