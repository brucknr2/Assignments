Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The overall objective of the proposed research is to investigate               
              the reciprocal interactions and the dynamic effects of social                  
              class upon school practices through a cross cultural comparison of             
              the knowledge transmission process in early 20th century                       
              elementary schools of Buffalo.  The main hypothesis is that class              
              was a greater factor than ethnicity or race in the schooling                   
              process.  During the planning stages, the PI will identify and                 
              study southern-born white and black immigrants to the city and                 
              study the shifts which occurred within these two populations                   
              between 1910 and 1930.  Having established their resettlement                  
              patterns in the city by social class, the PI will determine the                
              elementary schools in which their children enrolled.  Locating                 
              their schools would allow to investigate the responses of the                  
              public elementary schools to the children of immigrant                         
              populations.  The PI also plans to analyze the content of articles             
              published in the widely circulated School Magazine between 1918-               
              1932.  Through a systematic analysis, the investigator expects to              
              show similarities and differences in the types of school knowledge             
              transmitted to the pupil populations under study.
