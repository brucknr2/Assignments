Abstract    :
                   This proposal includes research in several areas of high                  
              resolution spectroscopy using laser techniques. Work on Stark                  
              Spectroscopy  is a continuation of past work and is directed                   
              towards providing precise measurements of electric fields. Work                
              on laser cooling and studies of laser noise are also proposed and              
              the author also proposes to  devote some effort to improving the               
              technology used in atomic physics using some of the new                        
              techniques that have recently become available.
