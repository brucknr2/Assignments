Abstract    :
                   This grant will support the work of Colgate University                    
              Professor Charles Holbrow, who will investigate the nuclear                    
              moments of radioactive nuclei.  Using the Stony Brook linear                   
              accelerator, radioactive recoil nuclei from heavy ion nuclear                  
              reactions will be stopped and neutralized in a gas cell.  Laser                
              light-induced resonance fluorescence will be used to examine                   
              the hyperfine spectra of atoms formed with the radioactive                     
              nuclei.  Undergraduate students from Colgate University are                    
              participating in this research.
