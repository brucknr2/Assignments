Abstract    :
                   This grant is for investigations of highly nonlinear                      
              magnetic and electric field configurations which are of interest               
              to space plasma physics.  The unique feature of the laboratory                 
              experiment is the capability to fully map three-dimensional,                   
              time dependent vector fields such as electric and magnetic fields              
              and to drive current systems and space charge distributions.                   
              Configurations of interest are the propagation of intense current              
              pulses and charged particle beams through magnetized plasmas.                  
              Such phenomena arise naturally in solar flares, auroral arcs, and              
              current sheets.  ***
