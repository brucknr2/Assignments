Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The RIDGE office will provide the focal point and the necessary                
              coordination as the RIDGE global change initiative makes the                   
              transition from the planning phase into its research phase. The                
              purpose of the office is to maintain the momentum of the RIDGE                 
              program during the transition between the early planning phase                 
              and active implementation of field, laboratory, and theoretical                
              efforts, and to coordinate the groundwork required to make                     
              themost efficient and valuable use of RIDGE funding. Primary                   
              efforts in the coming two years will involve implementation of                 
              long lead time activities, including instrument development and                
              data management; initiation of special field programs;                         
              coordination of research activities supported by a variety of                  
              agencies; convening the first RIDGE Summer Institute designed to               
              foster rapid progress in theoretical development; pursuit of                   
              international cooperative research efforts at bilateral and                    
              multilateral level; continued development and refinement of the                
              RIDGE Science Implementation Plan; publication and distribution                
              of all planning results; implementation of the capability to                   
              respond quickly and effectively to transient ridge-crest events;               
              analysis of material-properties research required to support                   
              RIDGE field and theoretical efforts; and a                                     
              periodic newletter.
