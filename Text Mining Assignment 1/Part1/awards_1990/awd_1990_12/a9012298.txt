Abstract    :
              Machine vision technology is an important component of factory                 
              automation.  At a time when American manufacturing seemingly has               
              lost its competitive edge and reputation for quality, machine                  
              vision can provide cost-effective solutions to alleviate these                 
              problems.  Unfortunately, making this technology work effectively              
              and reliably on the plant floor has been an unexpectedly difficult             
              and troublesome task.  Linear-camera based systems can be an                   
              effective solution for such problems and is the focus of this                  
              research.  In particular, this work addresses the current                      
              limitations of linear camera systems to enhance the low-level image            
              processing capabilities, research into dedicated high-performance              
              processor for intermediate-level processing and develop suitable               
              optimized algorithms for linear camera systems.  The selection and             
              implementation of appropriate hardware elements are made with the              
              realization that programming is usually a very significant part of             
              the overall cost of application development.
