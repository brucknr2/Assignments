Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to devise ranking and selection              
              (R&S) techniques for use with manufacturing simulations (by                    
              relaxing the normality and independence assumptions required in                
              classical statistical analyses).  Two lines of research are :  (1)             
              determining which of two stationary simulated systems has the                  
              largest mean and (2) consideration of a nonparametric (R&S)                    
              procedure for finding the best of k simulated systems.                         
                  Work will yield a collection of new methodologies, combining               
              older R&S methods with newer variance-estimation techniques that               
              are more  tolerant of autocorrelation in the data.  Results will               
              allow analysts more flexibility.
