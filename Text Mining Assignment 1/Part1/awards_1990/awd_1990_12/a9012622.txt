Abstract    :
              Intertidal algae in sub-polar and temperate regions experience                 
              frequent and severe freezing during tidal emersion in the winter.              
              The ability to survive repeated freezing is an important                       
              adaptation, and may greatly influence vertical zonation.  In                   
              contrast to higher plants, relatively little is known about the                
              ecological or physiological effects of freezing on marine                      
              macroalgae.  This research will focus on the role of freezing as               
              a sub-lethal stress, which reduces growth and perhaps competitive              
              ability, by examining the effect of freezing on photosynthesis.                
              The research will address the following questions: (1) what                    
              mechanisms are responsible for freezing resistance, (2) does the               
              same mechanism confer resistance to both freezing and                          
              desiccation, (3) are interspecific differences in freezing                     
              resistance correlated with tidal height due to genetic adaptation              
              or phenotypic acclimation, and (4) does the relative importance                
              of freezing acclimation vary between upper-shore, stress                       
              tolerant, and lower-shore, competitive algae?  This investigation              
              will contribute to our knowledge of freezing as an ecological                  
              factor, and also address questions of general importance to all                
              scientists studying the intertidal zone.
