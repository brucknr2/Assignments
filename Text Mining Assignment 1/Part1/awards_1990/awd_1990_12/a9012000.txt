Abstract    :
              A plant growth and instrumentation facility is requested to support            
              the research programs of a new and vigorous group of plant                     
              scientists in the following areas; plant growth and development,               
              plant genetics/molecular biology, plant insect and microbe                     
              interaction, and plant systematics/molecular evolution.  The main              
              components of the core center, to be located in the Biology                    
              Department, include greenhouses, environmental chambers and a                  
              central cell and tissue culture facility.
