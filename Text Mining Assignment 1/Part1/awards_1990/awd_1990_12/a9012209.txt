Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed study seeks to increase the fundamental                           
              understanding of the local effects of shear and                                
              turbulence on cell growth and productivity.  The                               
              experimental technique will involve measurement of fluid                       
              velocity, shear stress, and turbulent intensity in                             
              standard Bellco bioreactors with a Laser-Dappler                               
              Anemometry (LDA) system.  Velocity and turbulence                              
              mappings as a function of vessel height and radial                             
              distance will be determined over a wide range of                               
              operating conditions and vessel sizes.  LDA measurements                       
              will be done in reactors containing a medium analogue                          
              fluid that simulates the fluid environment of cultured                         
              cells.  Effects of hydrodynamic forces on the cells will                       
              be evaluated using standard cell loading, cell growth                          
              rate, oxygen uptake and product concentration                                  
              measurements.  Data collected will then be used to                             
              develop a quantitiative model correlating hydrodynamic                         
              properties with cell growth, metabolism and                                    
              productivity.  LDA measurements, as proposed in this                           
              study, are thought to allow for more accurate                                  
              correlations to be made in bioreactors where a high                            
              degree of non- uniform turbulence occurs.
