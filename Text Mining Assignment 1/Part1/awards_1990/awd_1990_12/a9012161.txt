Abstract    :
              Microzooplankton are a morphologically and ecologically diverse                
              group of organisms that exhibit a wide range of swimming                       
              behaviors.  These behaviors may have evolved primarily to allow                
              the organism to feed efficiently or to allow non-feeding forms                 
              to stay in the water column, but they also affect the ability                  
              of fish larvae to recognize potential prey, especially in                      
              estuaries where non-food, suspended particles are abundant.  In                
              contrast to visual predation on microzooplankton, little                       
              research has been done to test for selectivity of                              
              microzooplankton prey species by visual predators, and no                      
              definitive research has been done to understand how such                       
              selection is controlled. This project will investigate the role                
              of microzooplankton prey behavior in feeding selectivity by a                  
              visual predator (the early, post yolk-sac stage of the red drum                
              larva, Sciaenops ocellatus).  To evaluate the role of prey                     
              behavior in food selectivity by red drum larvae, a CellTrak                    
              video-computer system for motion analysis will be used to                      
              quantify prey behaviors in three dimensions during the                         
              encounter, attack and capture stages of predation. Based on the                
              research results, predictions will be made and tested regarding                
              microzooplankton prey selectivity by visually feeding larval                   
              fish.
