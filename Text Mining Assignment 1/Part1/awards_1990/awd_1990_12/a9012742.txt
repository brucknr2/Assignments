Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The first goal of this project is to empirically assess, by using              
              a simulated insanity defense trial with mock-jurors how mock-juror             
              insanity defense verdicts are affected by:  a) shifting the burden             
              of proof to the defendants; b) the availability of the "guilty but             
              mentally ill" verdict choice; and, c) narrowing insanity tests or              
              standards.  The second goal is to empirically determine (again                 
              with mock-jurors) how race of defendant and race of victim                     
              influences juror decision-making within the insanity trial domain.             
              In addition, the PI proposes to examine how jurors's attitudes                 
              toward:  a) "due process of law" versus "crime control"; b) the                
              death penalty; c) the insanity defense itself; and d) the                      
              efficacy/believability of expert psychological testimony relate to             
              their insanity defense verdicts.  One of the most fundamental                  
              questions being asked in regard to the insanity defense is:  What              
              are the causally efficacious factors which affect juror                        
              determination of a "Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (NGRI)"                   
              verdict?
