Abstract    :
              Under this award, Dr. Hogan will conduct three experiments in                  
              observational cosmology.  The first will be a search for cosmic                
              deuterium in the absorption spectra of distant quasars.  The                   
              statistics of quasars are well enough understood to make it                    
              possible to infer from such data how nucleosynthesis occurred                  
              during the big bang.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The second experiment will be a study with the Very Large Array                
              of small scale irregularities in the background radiation.  This               
              will enable the investigators to put better experimental limits                
              on theories of the formation of cosmic structure.                              
                                                                                             
              Finally, a long standing search for Lyman-alpha emission from                  
              galaxies at very high redshift will be continued.  Recent                      
              advances in technology will permit interesting new limits to be                
              placed on processes occurring during the formation of the very                 
              first galaxies.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Dr. Hogan, a leading young theorist, has been very active in                   
              designing and performing observations to test critical aspects of              
              modern cosmological theories.
