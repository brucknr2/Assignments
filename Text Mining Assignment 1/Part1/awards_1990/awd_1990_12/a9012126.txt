Abstract    :
              As part of this project the principal investigators will develop               
              an ocean bottom seismometer with a pressure sensor to be used to               
              measure the deformation of the sea bed due to passing trains of                
              sea-surface waves.  In order to increase the coupling between the              
              sea bed and the instrument, the PI's propose to design a                       
              hydraulic system that will bury the seismometer housing in the                 
              sea bed.  The instrument will be deployed on the Oregon                        
              accretionary prism where it will be used to determine the bold                 
              porosity and permeability of the prism.  These measurements are                
              of great importance in modeling the deformation of the prism.
