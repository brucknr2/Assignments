Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ddirect measurements of the volume transport, transport by water               
              mass, and overall temperature transport during an annual cycle                 
              will be made in Vitiaz Strait between Papua, New Guinea and Umboi              
              Island.  An estimate of the warm water carried by the western                  
              boundary current in the South Pacific toward the equator will                  
              result.  The cross.equatorial transport of heat the western                    
              boundary currents is an important contribution to the thermal                  
              balance of the world.  This project will also contribute to                    
              enhanced monitoring for the TOGA COARE Program.
