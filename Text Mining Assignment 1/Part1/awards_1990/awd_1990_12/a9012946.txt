Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research                            
              project between Dr. George Gruner of the University of                         
              California, Los Angeles, and Dr. A. Janossy of the                             
              Hungarian Central Research Institute for Physics is to                         
              study the low temperature and thermoelectric properties                        
              of CDW (charge density waves) conductors.  Efforts will                        
              focus on two aspects of CDW dynamics:  1) exploration of                       
              thermoelectric phenomena in the broad frequency and                            
              electric field domains and 2) clarification of the role                        
              played by Coulomb interactions in low temperature CDW                          
              dynamics.  Results of the research should answer                               
              fundmental questions about the validity of Onsager                             
              relations to nonlinear systems and about the cross-over                        
              from high-temperature to low-temperature dynamics.                             
                                                                                             
              This project in solid state physics fulfills the                               
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                         
              enabling leading experts in the United States and                              
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                       
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest                          
              and competence.
