Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia research                     
              project between Dr. William McCoy of the University of                         
              Massachusetts, Amherst, and Dr. Vojen Lozek of the Geological                  
              Institute, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences is to study loess                  
              deposits of the middle- and late-Pleistocene age in Czecho-                    
              slovakia and the Great Plains.                                                 
                                                                                             
              To determine relative chronology and paleoclimatology, the                     
              researchers will compare the loess records within the context                  
              of the oxygen-isotope record of the deep sea.  Results are                     
              expected to help us understand the global picture of                           
              continental climate change throughout the Quaternary, and in                   
              particular help define the role of dust in the mechanism of                    
              global climate change.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project involving climate dynamics and geology fulfills                   
              the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                     
              enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern                      
              Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research                      
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
