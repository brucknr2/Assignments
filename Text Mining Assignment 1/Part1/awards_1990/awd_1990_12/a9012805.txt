Abstract    :
                   H202 is believed to be an important oxidant of SO2 in cloud               
              droplets.  There is evidence to suggest that it may be entrained               
              into clouds that form at the top of well mixed boundary layers.                
              In these situations SO2 oxidation to sulfate depends not only on               
              the SO2/H202 ratio but also upon the entrainment of above cloud                
              air into the cloud.  Airborne experiments will be conducted near               
              Elk Mountain, Wyoming in concert with experimental studies                     
              planned for the Elk Mountain Observatory (EMO) to allow the PIs                
              to investigate the entrainment process by (1) comparing airborne               
              H2O2 measurements with surface H2O2 measurements at EMO, (2)                   
              using airborne releases of a tracer, SF6, both in the boundary                 
              layer air and in the above cloud air, while monitoring the tracer              
              at EMO, (3) comparing vertical profiles of potential temperature               
              for evidence of entrainment across the cloud-capping inversion,                
              and (4) comparing liquid water concentration and droplet spectra,              
              measured at EMO and from aircraft, with an adiabatic model of the              
              condensation process.
