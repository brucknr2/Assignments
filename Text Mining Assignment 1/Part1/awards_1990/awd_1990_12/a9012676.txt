Abstract    :
                   The Ga-As source of polarized electrons has important                     
              applications in atomic collision physics, surface physics and                  
              high energy physics.  Significant improvements of principal                    
              characteristics are found as temperature is lowered, but                       
              crystal lifetimes are shortened intolerably due to condensation                
              of impurity gases.  It is proposed to explore the use of in                    
              situ cesiation, which this group has found to be effective at                  
              room temperatures, to extend Ga-As crystal lifetime at low                     
              temperatures.
