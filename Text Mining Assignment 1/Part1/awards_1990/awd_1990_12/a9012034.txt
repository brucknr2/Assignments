Abstract    :
                   Chemical and structural defenses of the gorgonian coral                   
              Briareum asbestinum vary among different sites in the Caribbean                
              and between depths at a single site.  High site.specific                       
              variation in types of secondary terpenoid compounds of Briareum                
              asbestinum may be environmentally induced.  DR. Harvell will                   
              determine whether the observed variation in chemical and                       
              structural defenses of Briareum is genetic or environmentally                  
              induced and whether it is caused by selection by biotic agents.                
              Briareum is distinguished not only by a diverse complement of                  
              briareins (compounds) in adult colonies, but also a high                       
              investment in chemical defense of the oocytes, embryos, and                    
              larvae, affording the opportunity to investigate the ontogeny of               
              chemical defense in the life cycle.  Despite a decade of intense               
              research by chemists on bioactive compounds from gorgonians, no                
              studies have explored quantitative or qualitative of the life                  
              cycle.  In the first phase of the project the PI will (1)                      
              reciprocally transplant clonal replicates of shallow and deep                  
              adult colonies to measure genetic and environmental components of              
              defense, (2) determine sources of natural mortality of embryo and              
              larval stages, and (3) quantify the timing of switches in                      
              synthesis of major briarein compounds in colony development.  In               
              the second phase of the project she will (1) collect and analyze               
              (growth and defenses) the adult transplant, (2) establish                      
              juvenile transplants and selection experiments, and (3)                        
              investigate the palatability of briareins to predators using                   
              bioassays with artificial foods.
