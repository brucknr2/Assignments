Abstract    :
                   Precise theoretical values for the amplitudes of parity                   
              non-conserving transitions in heavy atoms induced by exchange                  
              of neutral Z particles between the nucleus and electrons will                  
              be studied. This will permit a determination of the Weinberg                   
              angle from atomic physics experiments.  The amplitudes are                     
              calculated using a relativistic version of many-body                           
              perturbation theory.  The multiple sum over states needed in                   
              evaluating higher order effects are performed using finite                     
              basis set techniques often in conjunction with the solution of                 
              partial differential equations.  With energies, transition                     
              amplitudes and hyperfine constants accurate to 1% the parity                   
              non-conserving amplitudes can also be obtained with errors at                  
              the 1% level.
