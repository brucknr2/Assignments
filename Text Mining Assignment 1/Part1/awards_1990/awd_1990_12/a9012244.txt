Abstract    :
                   A broad program of research in atomic and molecular                       
              physics and chemistry will continue in seven inter-related                     
              areas:                                                                         
                   (1) Fundamental and precision measurements, using the                     
              latest advances in atomic metrology coupled with new                           
              developments in lasers.  (2) Atom-single photon interactions,                  
              using trapped localized  atoms and a variety of electromagnetic                
              fields.  (3) Dynamics of atoms and their interaction with                      
              static fields, including both theoretical and experimental                     
              studies of atomic structure.  (4) Atom-electron, atom-atom, and                
              atom-atom-photon interactions, studying the properties of                      
              atomic collisions and energy transfer over a broad range of                    
              temperature.  (5) Simple molecular systems, including studies                  
              of excitation and breakup of such systems.  (6) More complex                   
              molecules and clusters, including studies of various bonding                   
              mechanisms and the properties of unusual aggregates of atoms.                  
              (7) Technology development, principally the development of                     
              more precise control over electromagnetic radiation and of                     
              more precisely localized ultra-low temperature atomic traps.                   
                   Each research topic contains both theoretical and                         
              experimental elements.
