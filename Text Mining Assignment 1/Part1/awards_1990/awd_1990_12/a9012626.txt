Abstract    :
                   The long range objective of the Computer Science Department               
              at Long Island University's Brooklyn Campus, by means of the                   
              five-year infrastructure grant (II-MI), is to build research,                  
              educational, and experimental laboratory capabilities in the area              
              of post-conventional relational DBMS technology VIZ, knowledge                 
              base management systems (KBMS) and object-oriented data base                   
              management systems (00-DBMS).  Research activities in these areas              
              will focus on the development of models, techniques and tools                  
              for extending (or transforming) conventional relational database               
              systems.  Implementation of these extensions, in the form of                   
              interfaces or modifications to the conventional relational data                
              base system, will be carried out in an experimental computer                   
              laboratory located within the department.  These research and                  
              implementation activities will coupled with and feedback to the                
              computer science curriculum.                                                   
                   The curriculum will be enhanced to include advanced material              
              and new courses in disciplines related to these research                       
              activities (eg, advanced artificial intelligence, advanced data                
              base systems, expert and knowledge base systems, expert and                    
              knowledge base systems, object-oriented programming and object                 
              oriented-system design).  In addition, a Laboratory Research                   
              Projects Course will be introduced whereby some of the extensions              
              and modifications, resulting from research activities, will be                 
              implemented.  Research and implementation activities will be                   
              conducted by Department faculty with the close cooperation and                 
              assistance of Ph.D granting Computer Science Departments in the                
              metropolitan area, viz, Polytechnic University, New York                       
              University and/or Columbia University.
