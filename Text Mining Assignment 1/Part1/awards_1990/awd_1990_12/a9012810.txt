Abstract    :
              This program continues a research effort on high resolution                    
              transmission electron microscopy studies of phase transitions and              
              solid state reactions in modulated structures.  The emphasis in the            
              new research will be on modulated structures which appear in the               
              high temperature superconductors.  The initial effort will be on               
              the bismuth-strontium-calcium cuprate system.  The study of the                
              modulation modes and their relation to the critical temperature                
              will be investigated.  The control of the modulation mode to find              
              new, improved materials is of interest.  The study of the                      
              microscopic features of intergrowth of modulated structures and                
              their relation to the superconducting properties will be                       
              emphasized.
