Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Hydrothermal precipitates formed from high-temperature                         
              fluids along seafloor-spreading centers undergo a variety of                   
              reactions in seawater. At least two of these reactions,                        
              scavenging and oxidative dissolution, have a significant                       
              influence on the chemical composition of seawater. During the                  
              next two years, the proposed research will consider hydrothermal               
              precipitates as both sinks and sources for trace metals in the                 
              ocean. The P.I.s propose to carry out a detailed, quantitative                 
              study of the role and mechanisms where by hydrothermal                         
              precipitates control the concentration of trace metals in                      
              seawater.
