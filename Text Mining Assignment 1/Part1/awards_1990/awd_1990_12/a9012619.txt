Abstract    :
                   This project will identify and weight factors influencing                 
              upward and downward socio-economic mobility through analysis of                
              the Current Population Surveys for 1973 through 1987.  Methods                 
              include description of rates by gender and race, loglinear                     
              analyses, multinominal analyses, and logistic regression analy-                
              ses.  These methods permit examination of mobility determinants                
              taking into account individual factors in addition to race and                 
              gender, and changing organizational structures.  Individual                    
              determinants and organizations have not been included in previous              
              work due to lack of statistical tools to include them.  They are               
              important because there is wide individual variation in success                
              rates within race and gender categories, and because most mobil-               
              ity occurs within organizations, whose opportunity structures                  
              change with economic changes and other factors.  Results of this               
              study will show changes in mobility which have occurred recently               
              due to such factors as laws against discrimination in promotions,              
              growth of service sector employment, increasing employment of                  
              women outside the home, and declines in durable goods manufac-                 
              turing.
