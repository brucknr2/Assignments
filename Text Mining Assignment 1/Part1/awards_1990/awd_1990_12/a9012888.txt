Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigator proposes to develop a project to examine the                  
              effect of chronic exposure to low-level concentrations of                      
              pesticides and their interaction with other environmental factors              
              on the growth, reproduction and respiration of marine and                      
              freshwater crustaceans.  Of particular interest would be the                   
              combined effect of pesticides and environmental factors such as                
              temperature, salinity and pH on the common shore shrimp,                       
              Palaemonetes vulgaris; the freshwater flea, Daphnia pulex  and the             
              scud, Gammarus pseudolimnaeus.  The compounds to be investigated               
              include representatives of two major classes of insecticides:  the             
              organosphosphate malathion, and the carbamate aldicarb, as well as             
              the triazine herbicide atrazine.  Short term bioessays will be                 
              conducted to determine the minimal concentration for each                      
              substance that will affect the reproduction, morphology and                    
              respiration of the organisms.  Although short term effects will be             
              documented, the primary interest of the investigation is to study              
              the long-term effect on the organisms resulting from continuous                
              exposure to low-level concentrations of pesticides in combination              
              with other factors.
