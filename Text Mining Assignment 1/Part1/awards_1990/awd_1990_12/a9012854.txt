Abstract    :
              Anti-reflection layers at the lens                                             
              boundaries will be implemented to                                              
              greatly reduce the Fresnel                                                     
              reflection, to develop a new                                                   
              structure for the lens waveguides to                                           
              obtain optimal mode match, and to                                              
              use GaAlAs for the host guiding                                                
              layer to make the lens transparent                                             
              to a wavelength as short as .75um.                                             
              The through-put efficiency is                                                  
              expected to increase to 95%, making                                            
              the new lens ready for actual                                                  
              applications.  Three applications                                              
              will also be performed, including an                                           
              imaging relay lens, a collimating-                                             
              transform lens pair and a micro-lens                                           
              array.  The realization of these                                               
              lenses would allow integrated                                                  
              optical devices to progress further                                            
              for actual applications.  It would                                             
              also cultivate new devices concepts                                            
              and applications, which in turn will                                           
              improve future signal processing and                                           
              communications systems.
