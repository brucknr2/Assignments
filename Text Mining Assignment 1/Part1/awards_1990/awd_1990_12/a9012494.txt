Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The proposed planning grant is aimed at developing a                           
              research proposal in the area of Ordered Geometry.  The                        
              planning stage will allow the investigator to get a deeper                     
              understanding of infinite planes and how the notions                           
              Archimedean ordered in the sense of Killgrove and in the                       
              sense of Priess-Cromps are developed in an ordered affine                      
              plane.  Ultimately, the investigator is interested in                          
              pursuing the question:  Do the Cauchy sequence and                             
              Archimedean ordered notions imply the Heine-Borel result?                      
              The investigation of ordered geometry will be further                          
              pursued by considering ordered planes when universally                         
              parabolic regions are convex.  This will be the                                
              preliminary stage to the question:  Which Desargues                            
              configuration arise?  Finally, the investigator will                           
              consider the Prenowitz approach to geometry.
