Abstract    :
              An investigation is proposed for the fabrication of                            
              novel surface superlattices which will combine with                            
              multiple quantum wells to form quantum wires along                             
              a semiconductor surface.  Quantum wires are                                    
              generally expected to have enormous potential for                              
              improving th performance of serveral optical devices,                          
              but currently the experimental realization of these                            
              structures has been limited because quantum wires                              
              are extremely difficult to fabricate.  GaAlAs multiple                         
              quantum well samples will be investigated, first using                         
              several novel approaches to forming quantum wires,                             
              namely (1) electric field-induced quantum wires, (2)                           
              strain-induced quantum wires, and (3) quantum wires                            
              formed with a focussed ion beam process.                                       
              Theoretical modeling will be used to determine the                             
              extent to which the experimentally fabricated                                  
              structures can provide two-dimensional quantum                                 
              confinement.  Quantum wire samples will be                                     
              fabricated and a number of optical techniques will be                          
              used to characterize the material including                                    
              photolumineescence to experimentally verify the                                
              presence of two dimensional quantum confinement.
