Abstract    :
                   Bound thiols are probably significant microbial substrates,               
              since over 95% of the 3-MPA and methanethiol fractions recovered               
              from the sediments are bound by disulfide linkages to sediment                 
              particles.  In previous research, 3-Mercaptopropionate (3-MPA)                 
              was detected as major thiol in the anoxic, coastal, marine                     
              sediments; present at lower concentrations were mercaptopyruvate,              
              mercaptoethanol and mercaptoacetate.  3-MPA occurred as its                    
              oxidized, dithio-form, in oxic regions of the sediments.                       
              Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), an osmolyte in marine plants,               
              was transformed in sediment slurries to 3-MPA by sequential                    
              demethylation with 3-methiolpropionate as an intermediate.                     
              Homocysteine and methionine were also converted to 3-MPA.  These               
              transformations need establishing by the isolation of the micro-               
              organisms that are involved.  Bacteria that demethylate DMSP or                
              3-methiolpropionate will be isolated, as will those which                      
              dissimilate and assimilate 3-MPA or its methylated precursors.                 
              Sulfate-reducers that incompletely oxidize organic compounds will              
              be tested for conversions of sulfur-containing amino acids to 3-               
              MPA, mercaptopyruvate, mercaptoethanol and mercaptoacetate.  The               
              ability of sulfate-reducers to oxidize mercaptopyruvate,                       
              mercaptoacetate and mercaptoethanol will also be studied.  The                 
              research will reveal biochemical conversions of organic thiols                 
              that are characteristic of, and perhaps unique to, marine                      
              sediments.
