Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to create a                                  
              miniature surface plasmon sensor for bioanalyte                                
              detection.  This will be attempted using                                       
              microfabrication techniques, similar to those                                  
              used in the manufacture of integrated circuits,                                
              and those advanced in the field of                                             
              microelectromechanical engineering.  The                                       
              research includes the development of a                                         
              miniature optical system, consisting of an                                     
              electrostatically controlled mirror and a                                      
              photodiode array.  If successful, this device will                             
              eliminate the need for a large, expensive optical                              
              bench, which is usually associated with the                                    
              detection of surface plasmon resonance.  The                                   
              sensor also has the potential of very low cost.                                
              This project integrates micromechanical devices                                
              with optics, electronics, and chemistry, and                                   
              requires a multi-disciplinary team.  It is an early                            
              potential application of active mechanical                                     
              elements in a micro-sensor.
