Abstract    :
                   Studies of employment and commuting patterns in American                  
              metropolises have disclosed that women generally work at jobs closer           
              to their homes and spend less time commuting than men.  Most of these          
              studies as considered women as a homogeneous group.  The degree to             
              which other economic, social, and ethnic factors may explain these             
              general variations therefore is not well understood.  This project will        
              focus on an analysis of differences in work locations and commuting            
              patterns among women from different racial and ethnic groups.  The             
              focus of the project will be development of a path-analytic model that         
              distinguishes the effects of economic, household, and transportation           
              characteristics on commuting time among people in different gender and         
              racial/ethnic groups.  The model will then be tested using statistical         
              analyses of Public Use Microdata Sample census data for the New York           
              Consolidated Statistical Area.                                                 
                   This project will contribute to our specific knowledge about the          
              dynamics of commuting patterns within the New York metropolitan area, a        
              region of exceedingly complex economic, social, racial, and ethnic             
              interaction.  More importantly, it will add to our general insights            
              about the factors that influence commuting and the relationships               
              between the locations of jobs and homesites in modern metropolises, and        
              it will enhance our understandings about the impact of gender on the           
              spatial activity of individuals and groups.
