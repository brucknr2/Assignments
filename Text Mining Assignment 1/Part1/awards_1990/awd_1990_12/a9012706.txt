Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, the PI plans to examine regional labor markets in             
              Japan, Great Britain and the United States and their response to               
              macroeconomic shocks.  He first plans to investigate adjustment of             
              real wages, unemployment or migration rates in response to shocks.             
              The effect of cultural and institutional factors that has an                   
              impact on labor market behavior will be mitigated by doing                     
              comparisons across regions within the same country.  The second                
              part of the analysis will be an attempt to cast some light on the              
              causes of these differences in response patterns.  The PI will                 
              conduct some preliminary tests for the causes of the regional                  
              differentials by examining the roles of unions, housing markets,               
              industry structure, education or skill differentials and other                 
              factors.  After isolating which hypothesis appear to be most                   
              promising, he intends to develop a full proposal and test a                    
              theoretical model about why regional markets may vary in their                 
              responses to these shocks.  The investigator plans to link this                
              work to current research on efficiency wages and insider-outsider              
              models of the labor market which have been used to explain                     
              aggregate unemployment and real wage movements.
