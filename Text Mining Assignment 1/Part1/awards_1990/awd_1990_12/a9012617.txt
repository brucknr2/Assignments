Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks to provide fundamental insight into how, in                
              the phytochrome photoreceptor (the plant growth and photoresponse              
              control agent) and bacteriorhodopsin ( a light driven proton                   
              pump), protein structure relates to protein function and                       
              reactivity.  The overall goal of this research is to study, using              
              time-resolved infrared spectroscopy from picosecond to kilosecond              
              time regimes, light-induced conformational changes and kinetic                 
              intermediates by following the dynamics of the protein amide I and             
              II regions, carboxylic groups, specific amino acid (i.e.                       
              tryptophan and tyrosine) and protein photointermediates.  In                   
              addition to the dynamic understanding of the interaction between               
              light and the photosensitive bilitriene phytochrome, the                       
              investigatior will determine a) orientation and strenght of                    
              possible hydrogen bonds between the imine hydrogen and a nearby                
              counter ion; and b) effects of a positive or negative charge near              
              the C=N frequency shift upon protonation of both the bilitriene                
              chromophore and the retinal Schiff's base chromophore.  This                   
              proposal is also aimed at learning how the reversible photocontrol             
              properties of phytochrome and bacteriorhodopsin can be used to                 
              produce light biosensors or photodevices.
