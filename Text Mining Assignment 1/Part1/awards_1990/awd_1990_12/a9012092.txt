Abstract    :
                   Dr. David Gillette, the State Paleontologist of Utah, is                  
              currently involved in the excavation of "Seismosaurus", an as-yet              
              undescribed sauropod dinosaur discovered in central New Mexico.                
              Current estimates suggest that this individual may measure 140'                
              in length, roughly half again as long as the largest known                     
              dinosaur.  This well-preserved specimen is the first articulated               
              sauropod dinosaur discovered in many decades, and study of the                 
              specimen, once excavated, will shed new light on the size limits               
              on terrestrial animals.  Excavation of this dinosaur skeleton has              
              been aided by several new remote sensing techniques (ground-                   
              penetrating radar, scintillation counting, magnetometry, and                   
              seismic diffraction tomography), under development at Los Alamos               
              National Lab.  These exploration tools are being developed to                  
              help locate buried containers of toxic waste and other hazardous               
              materials, and the only way to test their accuracy and                         
              reliability is to excavate the dinosaur.                                       
                   The proposed excavation has the potential for profound                    
              impact on our understanding of dinosaurs, and the size limits of               
              terrestrial life.  The project may have the added benefit of                   
              helping efforts to dispose of hazardous waste materials.
