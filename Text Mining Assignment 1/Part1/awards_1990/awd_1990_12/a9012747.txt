Abstract    :
              The objective of this research program is to investigate new                   
              approaches to the problem of modeling and tracking of a large class            
              of time-varying signals.  The class of signals under consideration             
              includes signals relatively concentrated in time-frequency, signals            
              with slowly varying amplitude and frequency, and some signals with             
              rapid variation in spectral content.  Both parametric and                      
              nonparametric approaches are being developed.  Parsimonious models             
              incorporating parameters that reflect non-stationary that are                  
              specific to the class of signals under consideration also being                
              considered.  Those models will provide an accurate and efficient               
              parametrization of signals in these classes.  Algorithms are being             
              developed in this project for efficient estimation of the model                
              parameters from noisy observations of the signal.  A nonparametric             
              approach utilizing new time-frequency representations based on                 
              determination of optimal signal-dependent kernels is also being                
              developed to overcome several problems which have plagued current              
              time-frequency methods.
