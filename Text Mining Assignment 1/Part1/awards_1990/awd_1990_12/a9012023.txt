Abstract    :
              This research is part of a long-term editing project, the first                
              comprehensive edition, in three volumes, of James Clerk Maxwell's              
              scientific letters and manuscript papers, to be published by                   
              Cambridge University Press.  Maxwell was the most important                    
              physicist of the nineteenth century, and his work was seminal in               
              establishing the electromagnetic theory of light and statistical               
              physics, work that is fundamental to modern science and technology.            
              Under this grant, Dr. Harman is working on the editorial commentary            
              for Volume II of the edition, which covers the years 1862-73.  The             
              manuscript papers of this period, which are of especial interest               
              and complexity, shed important light on Maxwell's scientific                   
              maturity, the period in which he wrote the classic works on field              
              physics and statistical molecular theory on which his unique                   
              reputation largely rests.  The edition aims at textual accuracy and            
              completeness. The textual notes and introductions clarify textual              
              obscurities and establish the historical context within which the              
              documents were written, employing contemporary published and                   
              manuscript sources.  The work, to be carried out at Harvard                    
              University in consultation with historians of physics in the Boston            
              area, will make available, in a critical edition, fundamental                  
              source materials for the study of modern science.
