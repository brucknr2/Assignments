Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project continues the summer conferences on political methodology         
              begun in 1984 and supported since 1986 by the Political Science                
              Program.  These workshops have brought together researchers and                
              graduate students who are actively contributing to the subfield of             
              political methodology.  Discussions and papers have been used to               
              develop an agenda for methodological research in political science and,        
              to some degree, in related disciplines; to disseminate and critique            
              research in this field; and to build up a core group of scholars who           
              are committed to the development of analytical work in all substantive         
              areas of political science.  This continued support will offset some of        
              the expenses of the conferences for the next two years.  Twenty faculty        
              members and between six and eight graduate students will attend the            
              workshops.  Papers are presented at the workshops addressing a                 
              methodological problem confronting political scientists.  Papers are           
              critiqued by all attendees and every effort is made to publish papers          
              and make them available to as broad an audience as possible.
