Abstract    :
                   Under a previous grant, the PI developed a very sensitive                 
              all-sky camera for imaging selected faint emissions from the                   
              night                                                                          
              sky that reveal important processes in the upper atmosphere.                   
              This camera was developed to support the CEDAR initiative aimed                
              at better understanding the coupling, energetics and dynamics of               
                                                                                             
              atmosphere retions.  The CEDAR Class-I Imaging System is now a                 
              fully-operational system located on the Millstone Hill                         
              Radar/Haystack Observatory complex in Westford, MA.  The image-                
              intensified CCD imaging system will operate 15 nights/month                    
              compiling a multi-wavelength database containing a rich variety                
              of sub-auroral ionosphere.  A small effort in equatorial aeronomy              
                                                                                             
              using data sets obtained by other means is included.  All of                   
              these studies merge optical, incoherent scatter radar and other                
              radio and satellite observations consistent with CEDAR campaign                
              science objectives.  Fabrication of a Class-I imaging                          
              spectrograph and investigation of a new CCD detector for imaging               
                                                                                             
              are the major instrumentation components of the program.
