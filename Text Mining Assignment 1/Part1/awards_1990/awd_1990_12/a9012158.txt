Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An idea which has emerged in biological oceanography is that                   
              pigment fingerprints, that is, the types and quantities of                     
              carotenoids and chlorophylls, can sometimes be used to determine               
              the types of organisms present in a water sample.  This method                 
              has been proposed for the ultraphytoplankton, where the organisms              
              are too small to be identified by light microscope techniques.                 
              Dr. Fawley proposes to determine if pigment fingerprints                       
              correlate with a biochemical character, the light-harvesting                   
              complex type, for the coccoid green ultraphytoplankton.                        
              Preliminary evidence indicates that some coccoid green                         
              ultraphytoplankton have a light-harvesting complex similar to                  
              that found in some green algae while others do not.  Results                   
              should provide evidence whether or not pigment fingerprints                    
              indicate valid taxonomic units.  In addition, these results may                
              suggest that some organisms should be included in existing                     
              taxonomic groups in the green algae, potentially resulting in                  
              taxonomic revisions.
