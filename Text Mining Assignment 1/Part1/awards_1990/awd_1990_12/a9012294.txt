Abstract    :
              This group of investigators will study theoretical models of                   
              ionic movement in biological channels.  The theoretical models                 
              will be used in conjunction with data, to suggest new                          
              experiments, and to modify the existing model.  The goal of these              
              models is to better understand the biology.  Many functions of                 
              many cells are determined by individual channel proteins, which                
              control the movement of substances and signals across otherwise                
              quite impermeable membranes.  This group will use the theory of                
              Brownian motion of ions in solution to analyze the experimentally              
              known properties of ion movement in channels.  The group hopes to              
              understand and predict the large mass of experimental data                     
              describing conductance, current-voltage relations, and                         
              selectivity of single open channels of various types.
