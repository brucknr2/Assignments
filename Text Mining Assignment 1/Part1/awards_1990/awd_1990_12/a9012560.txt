Abstract    :
              This project is in the area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry                
              and in the subfield of surface science.  Professor Zaera will                  
              study metastable adsorbates chemiabsorbed on single crystal                    
              surfaces using a host of spectroscopic methods.                                
                                                                                             
              This research will focus on detecting highly hydrogenated                      
              carbonaceous fragments on clean metal surfaces using                           
              reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy during catalytic                   
              reactions.  The results from this project will be useful in                    
              understanding catalytic hydrocarbon conversion reactions and in                
              designing new catalytic processes.
