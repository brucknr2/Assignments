Abstract    :
              Structurally simple, highly dispersed, supported metal                         
              catalysts are prepared and characterized.  The catalysts are                   
              prepared from organometallic precursors which are converted                    
              into organometallic clusters of defined structures on the                      
              surfaces of basic supports (magnesia and lanthana); subsequent                 
              decarbonylation gives clusters of supported metal atoms with                   
              the same number of atoms as the precursors.  The metals used                   
              in this study are iridium and platinum.  Samples are                           
              characterized with infrared spectroscopy, extended X-ray                       
              adsorption fine structure (EXAFS), and transmission electron                   
              microscopy; catalytic activities and selectivities are                         
              measured for hydrocarbon conversion reactions.                                 
                                                                                             
              This is a fundamental study of the effects of dispersion near                  
              the upper limit (or, equivalently, the effects of cluster size                 
              in small clusters) on the catalytic properties of metals.  The                 
              issue is a critical one for the optimization of systems                        
              employing rare-metal catalysts for a variety of industrial,                    
              energy, and environmental purposes.
