Abstract    :
              This proposal describes an ambitious investigation into connections            
              between corporate control activities (acquisitions, divestments),              
              commitment to innovation (research and development -- R&D), and                
              performance measures (such as a decline in competitiveness).                   
              Acquisitions, for instance, take considerable corporate effort and             
              promote a short-run view.  In turn, this draws attention away from             
              longer-run emphasis on corporate R&D, which may make a firm less               
              competitive.  Similarly, corporate restructuring can lead to                   
              increased debt, which inhibits R&D commitments.  Although                      
              plausible, these ideas have yet to be addressed in the economics,              
              finance, or management literature.                                             
                                                                                             
              The principal investigators propose a combination of primary and               
              secondary data sources to provide insights into internal corporate             
              dynamics.  The primary data source will be based on a large-scale              
              survey of almost 1000 companies, with detailed interviews at 30                
              companies.  The secondary data source will involve analysis of                 
              longitudinal records available from COMPUSTAT and other sources.               
              The integration of these two data sources offers the opportunity               
              to gain theoretical and empirical advances in understanding                    
              corporate response to restructuring.
