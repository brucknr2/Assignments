Abstract    :
              Adaptive control theory lacks a conceptual framework                           
              which is sufficiently simple to help qualified                                 
              nonspecialists to understand the current theory without                        
              making an inordinately large time investment and which                         
              might also serve as the basis for further development.                         
              We propose to continue our recently initiated research                         
              program aimed at constructing such a framework.                                
              Existing adaptive algorithms for which 'global' stability                      
              can be proved without requiring sufficient excitation are                      
              either applicable to process models satisfying assumptions                     
              which recent results show are unnecessary restrictive or                       
              perform inefficiently and consequently are of limited                          
              practical value.  The underlying reason for this is that to                    
              be applicable to "large" classes of process models, the                        
              parameter design models upon which certainty                                   
              equivalence control is based, almost always have points in                     
              their parameter spaces at which the design model is not                        
              stabilizable--and at such points, certainty equivalence                        
              control is impossible.  We propose to deal with this                           
              problem in two fundamentally different ways.  First, we                        
              propose to develop and utilize new parameterized design                        
              models which are stabilizable on their parameterized                           
              spaces and, in addition, are applicable to "large" classes                     
              of process models.  Second, as an alternative approach                         
              we propose to exploit the concept of "implicit tuning"                         
              which does not require a design model to be stabilizable                       
              at every point in its parameter space.  In both cases we                       
              shall rely heavily on computer simulation to rule out                          
              unacceptable algorithms and to guide us in the                                 
              development of acceptable ones.
