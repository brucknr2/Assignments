Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigator proposes to study diagenetic modifications in                 
              transgressive-regressive depositional sequences.  This systematic              
              study will include three major components:  a) detailed geochemical            
              and petrographic characterization of transgressive-regressive                  
              Tertiary sequences of Northern Puerto Rico; b) geochemical                     
              modelling of transgressive-regressive diagenetic settings using                
              the empirical data to constrain models; and c) detailed                        
              geochemical and petrographic study of a Paleozoic sequence in the              
              central North American midcontinent to test applicability of such              
              models and usefulness of Tertiary analogues for the Paleozoic.                 
              Petrographic characterization will include conventional                        
              petrographic examination of polished slabs and thin sections under             
              binocular microscopes and polarizing microscopes, examination of               
              polished thin slabs and thin sections using cathodoluminescence                
              and fluorescence microscopy, and examination by scanning electron              
              microscopy.  The geochemical characterization of selected                      
              componenets will include minor, trace and ultra-trace element                  
              determinations, carbon and oxygen stable isotope compositions and              
              87Sr/86Sr determinations.  Modelling will include geochemical                  
              modelling of fluid chemistry and mineral stability of the systems              
              to assess the thermodynamic limitations of the system, and                     
              diagenesis-sea level oscillation models to evaluate a broad range              
              of scenarios that could be present in the gologic record.
