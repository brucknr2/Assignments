Abstract    :
              It is proposed a combined experimental and computational study                 
              of particle-wall interaction in two-phase gas-solid flow.  The                 
              experimental work will be conducted in a wind tunnel in which                  
              the velocity, particle concentration, target orientation and                   
              temperature and controlled.  The impact and rebound particle                   
              velocity will be measured for different particle-target                        
              material combinations.  The frequency of occurrence of a                       
              rebound velocity as a function of the impact velocity and                      
              impact conditions will be analyzed and compared to a                           
              probabilistic model.  This is an interdisciplinary project,                    
              with aspects related to fluid mechanics, materials, computer                   
              simulation and laser measurements.                                             
                                                                                             
              The project is expected to make a useful contribution to                       
              particle-wall interaction modeling and erosion prediction in                   
              gas-solid particle flow, with application to turbines,                         
              compressors, combustion chambers and different chemical                        
              processes.
