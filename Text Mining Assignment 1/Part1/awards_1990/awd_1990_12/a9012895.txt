Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Mark               
              A. Matthews of the University of California, Davis to conduct                  
              collaborative research for eight months with Dr. Kenji Omasa of                
              the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba,                   
              Japan.  They will investigate the physiological mechanisms by                  
              which water deficits inhibit photosynthesis and by which photosynth-           
              eitic acclimation to dry conditions occurs.                                    
                                                                                             
              At low water status, stomatal closure and inhibition of chloroplast            
              function reduce photosynthesis.  Although significant nonstomatal              
              limitation to photosynthesis at low water status is widely                     
              accepted, most studies to date have assumed that rates of                      
              photosynthesis and transpiration are homogeneous over the                      
              experimental leaf area.  This project will use state-of-the art                
              instrumentations for localized measurements of leaf physiology to              
              take into account the heterogeneity in stomatal closure that may               
              occur at low leaf water status.  This will allow a more rigorous               
              assessment of the relative importance of stomatal and nonstomatal              
              limitation to photosynthesis under dry conditions.
