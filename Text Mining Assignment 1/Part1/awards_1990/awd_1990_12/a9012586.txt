Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Anoxic, varved sediments are accumulating along the margins of                 
              the Gulf of California at especially high rates.  The temporal                 
              and spatial distribution of these sediments remains to be                      
              determined, and consequently a full understanding of their                     
              origin is uncertain.  Dr. Karlin has studied the geochemical                   
              and paleomagnetic character of these materials at DSDP Site                    
              480.  The present award is to resample this Site and to                        
              participate on a coring cruise in June '90 to augment this data                
              set.  He has five objectives: 1) refine the paleomagnetic time                 
              scale at Site 480, calibrating to a delta O18 record that will                 
              be measured at WHOI, and to an automated varve-counting                        
              technique in collaboration with similar work by A. Soutar                      
              (Scripps) on box cores to be collected in June;  2) reconstruct                
              the last 250 Kyrs of productivity, ocean circulation , and                     
              continental climate from XRF and LECO geochemical analyses from                
              Site 480;  3) examine the last 20Kyrs of paleomagnetic secular                 
              variation recorded in the upcoming piston cores, dating with                   
              AMS C14, delta O18 and varve counting;  4) combine rock                        
              magnetic, sedimentological and geochemical studies to evaluate                 
              the effects of diagenesis upon the fidelity of paleomagnetic                   
              signals recorded in rapidly deposited sediments;  and 5) use                   
              similar rock magnetic and geochemical analyses to characterize                 
              the last 20Kyrs of spatial and temporal variations in                          
              productivity and terrigenous input to the Gulf of California.
