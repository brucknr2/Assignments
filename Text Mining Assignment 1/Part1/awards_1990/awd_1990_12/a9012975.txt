Abstract    :
              A simple testing procedure for the analysis of small strain and                
              dynamic/cyclic large strain behavior of soils will be developed.               
              The procedure will consist of a single slightly modified static                
              direct simple shear test. In comparison with the current practice              
              of small strain testing by resonant column device and separate                 
              large strain cyclic testing by triaxial, simple shear, torsional               
              shear or similar device, the new method will represent a more                  
              convenient and economical alternative for the dynamic/cyclic                   
              characterization of soils over the entire range of strains.//
