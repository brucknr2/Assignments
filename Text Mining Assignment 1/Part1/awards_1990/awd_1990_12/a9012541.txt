Abstract    :
                   Theoretical analyses in elementary particle physics will                  
              determine the predictions of the "standard model" of the basic                 
              forces for a variety of physical processes which are to be                     
              explored experimentally at high energy particle colliders of                   
              the present and future.  These processes include production of                 
              the particles which "carry" the weak force, production of jets                 
              of nuclear particles, and production of the hypothetical Higgs                 
              particle which is related to the origin of mass.  If we are to                 
              be able to use experimental data on these processes as evidence                
              of physics that goes beyond the well - established but limited                 
              "standard model," then we must first know the standard model                   
              predictions for the processes.  Hence, the studies to be                       
              undertaken in this project are an important step in the search                 
              for physics beyond the standard model.
