Abstract    :
              Research will be conducted on a number of current topics of                    
              interest in condensed matter physics.  Studies of holes in the                 
              two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnet will be continued, with                
              attention to the general question of their relevance to the                    
              electronic structure of copper-oxygen planes in high temperature               
              superconductors.  Possible spiral states will be investigated.                 
              The unusual vorticity stain correlations found in earlier                      
              numerical computations will be explored.
