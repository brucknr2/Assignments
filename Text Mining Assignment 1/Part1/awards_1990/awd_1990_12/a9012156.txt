Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI seeks to investigate culture-based reactions of Native                  
              Americans to technological innovations.  The argument, well based              
              on fact, is that Native Americans have not adapted to our highly               
              technological society as have other citizens of this country.  The             
              question is, Why not?  The investigator will also examine whether              
              cultural and social differences among tribes help account for                  
              differences between them in their success at integrating                       
              technology into existing ways of life.  Another important question             
              is why some technologies fit Native American cultures while others             
              do not.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              In this planning grant the investigator will conduct a thorough                
              literature review, discuss the proposed research with selected                 
              Native American community leaders and scientists, and conduct a                
              pilot project based on questionaires to test attitudes towards                 
              technology.
