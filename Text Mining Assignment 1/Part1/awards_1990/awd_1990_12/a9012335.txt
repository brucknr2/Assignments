Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a distinguished cultural anthropologist,               
              who has published widely on the ethno-ecology of the Philippines,              
              in a study of the local knowledge of Asian rice (Oryza Sativa).                
              The investigator will record how multiple and interlocking                     
              categorizations and evaluations of rice are structured and how                 
              such cognitive and associated behavior patterns are employed in                
              an integrated fashion under varying environmental conditions.                  
              Aided by prior linguistic and ethnoecological research, this                   
              project will examine in detail the everyday as well as the                     
              extraordinary handling of rice both as biotic resource and as                  
              cultural artifact.  The investigator will consult with colleagues              
              at the International Rice institute on the long-term stability                 
              and change in rice germ plasms.                                                
                                                                                             
              This research is important because rice is one of the world's                  
              great food crops, and yet a detailed scientific study of the full              
              range of knowledge and practice associated in a culture with this              
              crop has not been done.  This case will be a benchmark for                     
              comparative studies of the knowledge and uses of rice and will                 
              help planners develop programs to maximize and sustain valuable                
              diversity.
