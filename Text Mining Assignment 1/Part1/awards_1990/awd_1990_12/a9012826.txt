Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to explore the use of                   
              automatic learning techniques to enhance the performance of                    
              scheduling algorithms.  The work combines operations research and              
              artificial intelligence methodologies to exploit the structure of              
              the scheduling problem and the morphology of the data.                         
                   The expected results are fundamental advances in the science              
              base of planning and scheduling problems and the development of                
              strategies for the efficient solution of practical batch                       
              scheduling problems.
