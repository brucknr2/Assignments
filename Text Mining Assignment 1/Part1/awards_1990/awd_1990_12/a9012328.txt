Abstract    :
              This project continues research on producing improved and new                  
              Bayesian econometric methods and applying them in analyzing and                
              predicting economic data.  Topics to be pursued include: (1) work              
              on Bayesian learning models and procedures for generating prior                
              densities and models for observations; (2) Bayesian model and                  
              forecast combining techniques with applications; and (3)                       
              macroeconomic theory and Bayesian macroeconometric forecasting                 
              equations.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This research should improve existing methods of econometric                   
              inference and estimation.  The theoretical derivations of                      
              information processing rules could lead to a powerful new framework            
              for analyzing statistical information.  The Bayesian diagnostic                
              checking procedures developed in this project will prove useful                
              in detecting outliers and departures from specifying assumptions               
              in econometric studies.  A predictive test of when to combine and              
              when not to combine forecasts developed under the previous NSF                 
              grant will be generalized and applied to economic problems.
