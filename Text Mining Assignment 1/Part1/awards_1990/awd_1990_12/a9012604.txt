Abstract    :
              In this project, the P.I. will study the nonlinear dynamics of the             
              ocean general circulation, using an approach suggested from the                
              theory of equilibrium statistical mechanics.  The study will                   
              directly address the role of inertial aspects of the circulation.              
              Focus will be on extending the model of barotropic circulation to              
              include baroclinic effects, and carrying out a theoretical and                 
              numerical study of the baroclinic case.
