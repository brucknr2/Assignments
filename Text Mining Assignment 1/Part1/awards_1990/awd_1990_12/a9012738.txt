Abstract    :
              The mathematical programming and consensus questions to be                     
              considered have interested the two principal investigators,                    
              during their previous research efforts.  Since hierarchical                    
              classification can be viewed as a problem in mathematical                      
              programming, the possibility of linearizing in such a way as to                
              admit use of Karamarkar's algorithm will be investigated.  The                 
              consensus questions to be considered arise when one is confronted              
              with several classifications for the same collection of objects                
              and needs to determine the agreement among them.  Much of the                  
              research which will be undertaken involves Stinebrickner's s-                  
              consensus method which simultaneously produces a consensus                     
              classification and an index measuring the degree of agreement.  A              
              revised s-consensus method has been shown to satisfy three                     
              minimal and reasonable axioms which describe consensus behavior.               
              Efforts will focus on the discovery of new methods which produce               
              a consensus classification and index simultaneously and the                    
              discovery of new axioms which consensus methods may satisfy.                   
              Undergraduate students will be trained and collaborate in this                 
              project.//
