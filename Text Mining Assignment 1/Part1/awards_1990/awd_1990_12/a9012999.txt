Abstract    :
              This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduate                    
              site as an arctic Quaternary studies.  The program will                        
              consist of several phases designed to maximize collaboration                   
              between undergraduate institutions with personnel who                          
              specialize in Quaternary geology in the Polar regions.                         
              During the academic years, relevant courses will be taught                     
              at the participating institutions which will introduce                         
              students to various aspects of Quaternary geosciences.  The                    
              capstone of the program will be a field course, to be held                     
              in the southeastern Baffin Island, Canada.  The course will                    
              consist of introductory classroom lectures and an intensive                    
              field component in which students will undertake "hands on"                    
              studies in climatology, glaciology, glacially influenced                       
              sedimentary processes, and Quaternary geology.
