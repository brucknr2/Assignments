Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project is designed to acquire a better understanding                
              of the general principles whereby the brain of an animal learns                
              new things by touch and stores and recalls them as memories.                   
              Changes that occur in the brain of invertebrates during learning               
              are detectable with the electron microscope.  Experiments will be              
              conducted using fluorescent dyes to determine how the cells in a               
              specific part of the brain are connected to other parts of the                 
              brain that are involved in the learning process.
