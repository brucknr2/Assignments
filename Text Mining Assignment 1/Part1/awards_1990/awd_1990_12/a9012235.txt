Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The causes of variations in the axial morphology of mid-                  
              ocean ridges is poorly understood and has been related to a                    
              number of factors such as spreading rate and distance from                     
              ridge-transform intersections. From bathymetric profiles from                  
              the North Atlantic, the Principal Investigator has extracted the               
              following parameters: latitude, spreading rate, distance from                  
              ridge-transform intersection, zero-age depth, rift-valley                      
              relief, rift-valley width, and smoothed variations of the latter               
              three variables. He has done linear correlation and multiple                   
              regression analyses of these data and reached several                          
              conclusions based on the correlations among parameters. This                   
              project will extend this work to analyze in a similar manner a                 
              world-wide bathymetric and gravity data set with the goal of                   
              determining which are the most important factors controlling the               
              overall morphology of mid-ocean ridges.
