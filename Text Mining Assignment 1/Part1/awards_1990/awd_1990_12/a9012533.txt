Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigator proposes to help fill in the gaps in our                      
              knowledge by conducting a survey of Mexican American                           
              political organizations, their goals, tactics, and                             
              methods by which they attract and retain their members.  A                     
              major empirical question to be explored is how a reward                        
              schedule offered by leaders is structured and adjusted in                      
              order to assure continued member participation.  The PI will                   
              identify four basic types of groups in the Mexican American                    
              Political Culture.  He hypothesizes that 1) Lower income                       
              organizations will depend almost exclusively on expressive                     
              rewards while downplaying the social and recreational                          
              aspects of their incentive package and 2) Upper class                          
              organizations will focus more on material rewards for group                    
              membership while offering a wider range of solidarity                          
              benefits.  He also hypothesizes that the relationship                          
              between staff and the rank and file varies according to the                    
              socioeconomic status of the membership.  Groups chosen for                     
              the survey will be politically active groups in the two                        
              largest Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area for                             
              California, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois                     
              and active groups in Washington D.C.  These groups will be                     
              selected from three major national Hispanic Directories.  To                   
              augument the list,interviews with local politicians,                           
              activists, scholars and journalists will be conducted.
