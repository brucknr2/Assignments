Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Endogenous Opioid Regulation of Synaptic Transmission in the                   
              Dentate Gyrus                                                                  
                                                                                             
              An important role of endogenous neuropeptide transmitters in                   
              brain function is suggested by their prevalence and diversity.                 
              Understanding how these molecules may normally function as                     
              potential neurotransmitters requires that we know what controls                
              their release, where they act, and what effects they have. We                  
              have made substantial progress in answering these questions for                
              endogenous opioid peptides in the hippocampus by characterizing                
              the molecular forms of the peptides present, the distribution                  
              of the receptor sites, and the pharmacological effects of                      
              opioids in each of the principal regions of the hippocampus.                   
              Further work is required to define the effects of endogenously-                
              released opioids on hippocampal neurons. Information obtained                  
              from this study will allow us to construct a detailed                          
              description of the role of endogenous opioid peptides in the                   
              hippocampal neural network and provide a model of neuropeptide                 
              action in normal hippocampal physiology associated with                        
              learning and memory processes.
