Abstract    :
                   The University of Utah, in conjunction with the University                
              of Texas at Austin, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and                 
              the University of Washington, will conduct a Regional Geometry                 
              Institute aimed at integrating research and educational                        
              activities in the area of geometry.  The participants in the                   
              Institute will include research faculty in mathematics;                        
              mathematics educators; faculty from undergraduate institutions;                
              graduate, undergraduate and high school students; and high school              
              teachers.  They will participate in month-long summer workshops                
              and in academic year activities at three sites.  The guiding                   
              philosophy of the Institute is that research and education in                  
              mathematics can and should be working partners, and that                       
              researchers and educators can benefit from one another.  During                
              the first year the research focus will be the geometry and                     
              topology of manifolds and quantum field theory.  During the                    
              second year the focus will be on nonlinear partial differential                
              equations in differential geometry.  The educational component                 
              will focus on various means of introducing modern concepts in                  
              geometry into the undergraduate and precollege classroom.
