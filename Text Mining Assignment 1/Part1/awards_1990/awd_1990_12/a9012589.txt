Abstract    :
                   This project is designed to develop five-year planning                    
              activities in four main categories:  computing hardware, four                  
              areas of research, opportunities for faculty research and                      
              training, and recruitment of new computer science and                          
              engineering faculty (CSE).  The objectives are to develop                      
              detailed plans for:                                                            
                   01.  Upgrading the hardware of the COSDET Center for the                  
              four research areas selected.                                                  
                   02.  Establishing and upgrading laboratories and programs                 
              for research work in:  software engineering laboratory;                        
              intelligent databases and expert systems; knowledge                            
              representation and cognitive sciences; and networking and                      
              communications research.                                                       
                   03.  Offering a two-phase program of research and training                
              opportunities for presently employed faculty in computer science               
              and engineering (CSE).                                                         
                  04.  Recruiting new faculty with terminal degrees in the                   
              discipline of CSE.
