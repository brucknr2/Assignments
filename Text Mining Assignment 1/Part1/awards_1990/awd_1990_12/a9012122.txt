Abstract    :
              The purpose of this continuing research is to produce a                        
              quantitative economic history of the emergence and perfection of               
              efficient and integrated international capital markets during the              
              period 1811-1914.  This study will also involve developing a data              
              base consisting of the share price lists published regularly for               
              the stock exchanges of London, Amsterdam, Paris, and New York.                 
              The research results will provide new insights into the                        
              disruptions and subsequent adjustments in the pricing of                       
              internationally-traded financial assets that are created by the                
              addition of new markets and traders, changes in government                     
              regulations of existing markets, changes in institutional design               
              of stock markets, or advances in the technology of communications              
              linking the various financial markets.  This research is                       
              important because it will provide a quantitative standard of                   
              market integration and efficiency that can be used to calibrate                
              measures of financial market operation in other periods.                       
              Further, the nineteenth century is an especially interesting                   
              period for establishing such measures for evaluating current                   
              developments in international financial markets.  This period is               
              characterized by the spread of financial capitalism to variety of              
              countries with very different legal and institutional histories,               
              and by the integration of the corresponding secondary markets in               
              transferable securities through the first telecommunications                   
              revolution.  Also, this period ends with rise of increasing                    
              regulation of stock exchanges in the form of both self-regulation              
              and state regulation.
