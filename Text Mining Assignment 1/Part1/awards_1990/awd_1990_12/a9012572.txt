Abstract    :
              Variations in trace element distributions at mid-ocean ridges have             
              often been used to constrain parameters such as melting source                 
              compositions, depth and degree of melting, and size and shape of               
              source regions.  Traditional trace element models assume some model            
              of the melting process that, in general, do not include either the             
              physics of magma migration or trace element transport.  The purpose            
              of this research is to investigate and quantify to what degree                 
              observable trace elements to varying parameters such as flow                   
              regime, sensitive is the behavior of trace element distribution can            
              distinguish between different potential mantel processes.  The                 
              behavior of arbitrary initial trace element distributions can be               
              calculated for a range of physically consistent models governing               
              the flow of melt and solid in the mantle.  The following questions             
              will be addresses.  How sensitive is the behavior of trace elements            
              to varying parameters such as flow regime, degree of melting,                  
              source characteristics, porosity/permeability structure?  Can these            
              parameters be recovered from trace element distribution observed at            
              the surface?  What are the errors in the parameters recovered using            
              more traditional melting models?
