Abstract    :
              Because of recent scientific developments, philosophers of                     
              science have become increasingly interested in the ideas of                    
              probabilistic causation and explanation.  This contrasts with                  
              deterministic causation, in which causes are conceived as                      
              necessitating their effects, and with theories of explanation                  
              in which explanatory data are required logically to imply that                 
              the relevant phenomenon occurs.                                                
                                                                                             
              Under a previous NSF grant, Dr. Eells wrote a book,                            
              Probabilistic Causality, where he distinguished type level                     
              causation (about causal relations in general between factors                   
              or properties) from token level causation (about causal                        
              relations between actual, concrete events), and he developed                   
              a new probabilistic theory for the token level.  The primary                   
              aim of this new project is to apply the token level theory of                  
              Probabilistic Causality to the proper understanding of                         
              explanation of particular events.  The idea of causation is                    
              integral to the theory of explanation, but the extension of                    
              a theory of causation to a theory of explanation is intricate.                 
              Because of analogies between Dr. Eells' token level theory of                  
              causation and Professor Salmon's theory of causal process                      
              presented in 1984, it seems that Dr. Eells theories developed                  
              in his book can be extended in ways that can improve upon                      
              Salmon's ideas involving causation in the theory of                            
              explanation.  Under this grant, Dr. Eells is carrying out the                  
              work of making this extension from the theory of causation to                  
              a probabilistic theory of explanation.
