Abstract    :
              The project deals with a combination of simple experiments and                  
                                                                                            
              numerical simulations to compute hydrodynamic forces on                        
              particles in dispersed two-phase flow.  The experiments are on                 
                                                                                             
              the following five topics: (1) Evaluation of the inertial                      
              effects in oil-water mixtures, (2) The effective density of                    
              mixtures of fluids and solids, (3) Determination of the                        
              frequency of wake interactions of fluidized spheres, (4) Image                 
                                                                                             
              analysis of two-dimensional beds of particles, and (5)                         
              Lubricated transport of flowing particulates.  Corresponding                   
              two-and three-dimensional finite element simulations will be                   
              performed for flows satisfying the Navier-Stokes equations.                    
              Forces and couples acting on particles will be determined.                     
              The objective of the research program is to obtain data for a                  
                                                                                             
              "molecular dynamic" simulation of flowing mixtures.                            
                                                                                             
              This project will develop fundamental information necessary                    
              for modeling of interaction forces and flow characteristics in                 
                                                                                             
              particulate two-phase systems, with application to a variety                   
              of processes in industry and natural phenomena.
