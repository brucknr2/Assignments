Abstract    :
              The Fallen Leaf Lake Conferences initiated in 1985 is a yearly                 
              event devoted to the molecular biology and genetics of plant                   
              pathogenic bacteria, fastidious prokaryotes and related areas                  
              dealing with these and other microorganisms.  This year's                      
              conference follows the ancillary field of broad-host-range (or                 
              "promiscuous") plasmids, the first meeting of which took place in              
              Birmingham, England in the summer of 1987 (sponsored by EMBO).                 
              The Fallen Leaf Lake Conferences offer the special opportunity                 
              for plant pathologists to interact with experts in a particular                
              field.  Only the latest unpublished information is exchanged at                
              the Fallen Leaf Lake conference and ample opportunity for                      
              scientific interactions is provided during the course of the                   
              conference.  The conference is attended by members representing                
              most of the major laboratories from many different countries, and              
              therefore provides excellent opportunity for graduate and                      
              postdoctoral student to interact with internationally recognized               
              experts in a specific field.
