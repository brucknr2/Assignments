Abstract    :
              In this project, the P.I. will study the annual cycle of                       
              thermocline variability in the equatorial Pacific, using a new                 
              compilation of hydrographic data.  Tests indicate that a                       
              vertically propagating annual Rossby wave can be resolved by the               
              available data.  Comparisons will be made with linear wave theory,             
              and attempts will be made to relate the observed waves with wind               
              forcing.
