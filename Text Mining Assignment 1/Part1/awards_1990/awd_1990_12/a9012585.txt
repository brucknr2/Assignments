Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigator proposes a formalism which will express                       
              (e/h) in terms of the longitudinal deposition of high energy                   
              hadrons, the number of radiation lengths in the calorimeter,                   
              the number of absorption lengths, relative weight of the                       
              electromagnetic core of the shower and the relative weight                     
              of the hadronic part of the shower.  The data sample will                      
              represent lepton and hadron energies from 10 Gev to 150 Gev;                   
              and Bock's logarithmic energy dependent functions alpha,                       
              betha, delta and w, will be used to parametrize the hadron                     
              shower profiles.  The formalism will be tested with data                       
              taken in calorimeters using 238U, Pb or Fe absorbers and                       
              plastic scientillator, liquid argon, or silicon readout.                       
              The PI plans to add several students to the research                           
              project at Chicago State University and therefore have                         
              developed a mathematics workshop/tutorial in that regard.                      
              The workshop incorporates individualized instruction with                      
              extensive problem solving sessions for students pursuing                       
              bachelors degrees in engineering and physical sciences.  The                   
              preliminary plan will:  1) develop mathematical skills in                      
              undergraduate students; 2) assess the significance of the                      
              research and identify the analytical techniques that will be                   
              used, and 3) apply the formalism to experimental data from                     
              colliding beam experiments at CERN and Fermi National                          
              Accelerator Laboratory.
