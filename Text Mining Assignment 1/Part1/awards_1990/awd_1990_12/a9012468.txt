Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Microtubules, a complex network of protein filaments found in the              
              cytoplasm of the cell, are important in the maintenance of form                
              and function in nerve cells.  Developing nerve cells require the               
              capacity to stabilize certain microtubule populations, as well as              
              the ability to make new microtubules.  Abnormalities observed in               
              the aging brain may result from abnormal modulation of                         
              microtubule stability.  Understanding the regulation of neuronal               
              form and function will depend on knowing the mechanisms that                   
              regulate microtubule assembly and stability.  Microtubules,                    
              comprised of the protein tubulin that has been acetylated, have                
              been shown to be more stable.  The investigator will study                     
              whether tubulin acetylation regulates microtubule stability in                 
              neurons by purifying an enzyme from brain tissue that acetylates               
              tubulin.  The enzyme preparation will be used to acetylate brain               
              microtubules in vitro, to determine whether the microtubules cold              
              stability is altered due to the effects of the binding of                      
              microtubule-associated proteins.  These studies will provide                   
              information on acetylated tubulin enzyme regulation during                     
              postnatal brain development, maturation and aging.
