Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed research is the continued evaluation             
              of high energy, high mass ions and their effect on resolution for              
              Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass                        
              spectrometry.  During the requested funding period, the                        
              investigator will prepare a competitive research proposal that                 
              will incorporate laboratory experiments along the lines                        
              illustrated in the proposed text.  That is, he will critically                 
              evaluate the ion physics as revealed by the computer simulations               
              to design his laboratory experiments.  He considers that such an               
              approach is essential in the development of high mass FT-ICR. He               
              suggests that FT-ICR can play a major role in bioanalytical mass               
              spectrometry, ranging from applications that require ultrahigh                 
              sensitivity to more complex areas dealing with structure (e.g.                 
              amino acid sequence) and structure/function relationships.
