Abstract    :
                   This Small Grant for Exploratory Research supports a project              
              to implement the Number Field Sieve, the newest method for                     
              factoring large integers. The principal investigators are                      
              Professor Robert Robson of the Mathematics Department and                      
              Professor Walter Rudd of the Computer Science Department at                    
              Oregon State University, and Professor Joe Buhler of Reed                      
              College. The Number Field Sieve has a predicted running time that              
              is so much better than that of the previously known methods of                 
              factoring that the Principal Investigators believe that they will              
              be able to factor numbers in the 145-digit range, far larger than              
              has been possible up to now.                                                   
                   Except for counting, number theory, which is the study of                 
              the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of                   
              mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have                    
              furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the              
              fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most               
              recent and most astonishing applications of number theory have                 
              appeared in theoretical computer science and coding theory. In                 
              particular, the difficulty or ease of factoring large numbers has              
              turned out to have a direct application to the security of                     
              public-key codes.
