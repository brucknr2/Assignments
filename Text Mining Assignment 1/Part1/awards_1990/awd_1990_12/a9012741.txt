Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Complimentary metal oxide silicon (CMOS) static random access                  
              memory (SRAM) cells have decreased in size more than two times                 
              with the introduction of each new generation of SRAM array.  Now               
              the transient effects of excess carrier generation on the circuits             
              of the memory cell must be understood in order to design the SRAM              
              cells.  The research is to design an equivalent circuit model                  
              of an SRAM cell which approximates the cell transient response                 
              during a single event upset.  The model will be verified both                  
              numerically and experimentally.  Applications to the design of                 
              SRAM arrays will be investigated.
