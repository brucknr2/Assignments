Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During a 1987 expedition to the Marquesas island chain, the                    
              principal investigators mapped part of a high ridge that lies                  
              at the intersection of the Marquesas swell with the Marquesas                  
              fracture zone.  They concluded that the fracture zone is a weak                
              zone within the Pacific plate that allowed magmas from a weak                  
              hotspot to reach the surface.  This project will survey                        
              sections of the Marquesas fracture zone using multibeam                        
              bathymetric tools, gravity, magnetics, single-channel                          
              reflection, and dredging.  The survey will study the magmatic                  
              expression of three hotspots before, during, and after they                    
              encounter the fracture zone.  The morphology of the fracture                   
              zone at the hotspot intersections will be contrased with other                 
              segments that have not encountered hotspots.  The overall goals                
              are to better constrain the origin of fracture zone topography,                
              the intrinsic dimension and temporal continuity of hotspots,                   
              their interaction with lithospheric discontinuities, and the                   
              azimuth and extent of the oldest sectionof the Marquesas                       
              fracture zone.
