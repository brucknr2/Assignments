Abstract    :
                   Measurements of the concentration of 210Pb and 7Be in all                 
              aerosol samples collected as part of the standard AEROCE protocol              
              at all primary and secondary sites and the monthly deposition                  
              flux of 210Pb and 7Be to all primary and secondary sites will be               
              conducted.  These nuclides have well-known sources and do not                  
              undergo chemical transformations.  There are 4 objectives:  1)                 
              The observed concentrations and deposition of these nuclides will              
              be used to test and refine both event-oriented and climatological              
              numerical models of atmospheric transport.  2) The correlations                
              between the radionuclides and other species will be used to infer              
              the sources of the other species and of seasonal changes in                    
              source or transport.  3) The ratio of deposition rate to surface               
              air concentration will be used to measure the transfer rate of                 
              aerosols to the surface.  4) The 7Be/210Pb ratio will be tracked               
              as a potential measure of both the vertical mixing in the                      
              troposphere and the altitude of aerosol removal.
