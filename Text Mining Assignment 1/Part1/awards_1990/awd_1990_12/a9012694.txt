Abstract    :
              This project involves the design and execution of laboratory                   
              experiments on cooperation in finitely repeated games.  Particular             
              conditions to be examined include nonbinding communication ("cheap             
              talk").  Other experiments are designed to investigate the                     
              relationship between cooperation levels and the payoff properties              
              of outcomes that serve as possible punishments or rewards.                     
                                                                                             
              Game theorists have devoted considerable attention to models of                
              equilibrium cooperation in dynamic, multi-stage games.  The                    
              conditions thought to be necessary for such cooperation to occur               
              are affected by market and individual characteristics that alter               
              the structure of the game.  This project examines the behavioral               
              significance of these characteristics.  Such an assessment is                  
              important for future theoretical work.  In addition, insights                  
              gained from laboratory data may aid in predicting when cooperative             
              outcomes will arise in naturally occurring markets.  Many policy               
              debates turn on assumptions about the extent to which economic                 
              agents behave cooperatively.  The desirability of challenging a                
              horizontal merger, for example, depends largely on the likelihood              
              of a post-merger conspiracy.  Similarly, when product quality is               
              unobserved prior to purchase, consumer-protection policies may be              
              unnecessary if consumers and producers cooperate.
