Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Studies of sedimentary processes in the deep sea, estuaries, and               
              large lakes show the presence of lineated sedimentary bedforms                 
              (furrows) with cross-flow dimensions of several to tens of meters              
              in cohesive sediments.  These bedforms have developed as the                   
              result of long-term interaction between flow and the                           
              sediment, and the structure of the bedform must contain important              
              information about the growth of the bedform and the time                       
              variability of the currents which have created it.  The project                
              will develop and use a ultra-high-frequency subbottom profiler                 
              for use in studying the upper 1+ m of the sediment surface from                
              manned submersibles in order to study the structure of                         
              sedimentary furrows (and other intermediate-scale sedimentary                  
              features) in Lake Superior and, at a later date, in the deep                   
              sea.
