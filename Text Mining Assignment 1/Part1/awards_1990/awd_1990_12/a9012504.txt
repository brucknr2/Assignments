Abstract    :
                   The proposed research will test a model that predicts higher              
              rates of encounter between zooplankton and their prey in                       
              turbulent than still water. If this model is correct, feeding and              
              egg production rates od copepods should increase as turbulence                 
              increases, provided food in limiting. Experiments will be run in               
              100-1 microcosms using three species of copepod and three levels               
              of turbulence established using a pair of vibrating grids, with                
              mesh separating the copepods from the grids. Preliminary                       
              measurements will be made to establish the range and spatial                   
              distribution of turbulence. Food concentration will be limiting,               
              except in high-                                                                
              food containers that will control for direct, physical effects of              
              the turbulence on the copepods. The model will be supported by                 
              significant increases of egg production or feeding with                        
              increasing turbulence in treatments with limiting food                         
              concentrations. This result would have implications for the                    
              effect of the physical environment on copepods and how they                    
              obtain their food in the sea. In addition, it may call into                    
              question the applicability of many experiments on the feeding and              
              growth of copepods in bottles.
