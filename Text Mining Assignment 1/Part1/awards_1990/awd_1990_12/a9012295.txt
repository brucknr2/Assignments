Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The SUPER Program has completed its field work and most of the                 
              ensuing laboratory analyses.  SUPER stands for SUbarctic                       
              Pacific Ecosystem Research, a program studying the pelagic                     
              production dynamics of the Gulf of Alaska, sponsored by NSF.                   
              Six expeditions into the Gulf of Alaska were mounted for a                     
              large variety of observations.  The goal was to understand the                 
              absence of phytoplankton blooms in this region, together with                  
              continuously high concentrations of nutrients like nitrate.                    
              This investigator represents an accomplishment-based renewal                   
              (ABR) in order to prepare a full summary in book form of the                   
              SUPER results.  This also would take account of other past and                 
              current research on the pelagic ecology of the subarctic                       
              Pacific.  The SUPER group did arrive at a new, system-level                    
              view of production dynamics in the subarctic Pacific. This                     
              system level view will be the basis for developing the summary                 
              for the SUPER results.
