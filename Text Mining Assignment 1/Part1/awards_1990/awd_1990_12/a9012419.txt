Abstract    :
              The main goals of this project are to define the various senses in             
              which mathematics is applicable in the natural sciences and to                 
              establish whether or not the applicability of mathematics--in any              
              or all of the senses--poses a philosophical problem.  Recent                   
              philosophy of mathematics, where it deals at all with the                      
              applicability of mathematics, emphasizes metaphysical issues                   
              concerning the alleged gap between mathematical reality and                    
              physical reality.  Dr. Steiner is dealing with epistemic issues of             
              concern to physicists:  what Eugene Wigner has called the                      
              "unreasonable effectiveness" of (a) mathematical concepts and (b)              
              mathematical formalisms.  Unlike Wigner, however, Dr. Steiner is               
              focusing primarily on the role of mathematics in discovery:  (a)               
              how mathematical concepts allow physicists to make discoveries by              
              formal mathematical analogy; and (b) how mathematical formalisms               
              are, in the words of Heinrich Hertz, "wiser than their                         
              discoverers," since they contain latent, unintended information.
