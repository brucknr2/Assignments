Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, the P.I. will apply available numerical models                
              of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, recent "gappy" boundary layer                
              theory, and available wind, pressure, and sea level data to                    
              understanding the dynamics of ENSO (El Nino/Southern                           
              Oscillation), particularly in the region of the "gappy" western                
              boundary.  In particular, the P.I. will attempt to establish                   
              whether or not there is a link between reflection of waves from                
              the western Pacific boundary and subsequent anomalies at the                   
              equator.
