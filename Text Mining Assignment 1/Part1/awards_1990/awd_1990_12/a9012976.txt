Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for funds to partially defray expenses                   
              for graduate students, post docs, and some foreign visitors, so                
              that they can attend the Gordon Research Conference on                         
              Photonuclear Reactions.  This conference is one in a                           
              continuous, biennial series spanning nearly 30 years.  It is                   
              the most important conference in electromagnetic nuclear                       
              physics, a top priority sub-discipline within nuclear science.                 
              This years conference deals with many forefront issues that                    
              will be attacked by the new facilities under construction in                   
              the US and abroad including among other subjects new few-body                  
              system results, spin physics, coincidence studies, and quark                   
              effects in nuclei.
