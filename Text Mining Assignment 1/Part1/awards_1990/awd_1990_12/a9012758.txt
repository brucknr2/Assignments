Abstract    :
              This grant provides travel and expenses for several invited                    
              scientists and scholars to present papers at the First World                   
              Congress of Biomechanics, in San Diego, Friday, August 31.  These              
              papers will form the core of a mini-symposium on "Ethical Issues               
              in Bioengineering," and cover topics such as:  allocation of scarce            
              resources, clinical trials of new devices and implants, conflict               
              of interest, and human and animal experimentation.  Bioengineers               
              face medical ethics problems, but they are not often exposed to                
              training in the principles and issues of biomedical ethics.  Nor               
              is much of the material in this area focused in a way that                     
              addresses their concerns directly.  These speakers will provide an             
              important initial resource to develop this field.  The talks will              
              be published in a special issue of the journal Annals of Biomedical            
              Engineering.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The proposal focuses on an important area; the principal                       
              investigator and invited speakers are very well qualified; the                 
              modest funds that are requested should stimulate initial attention             
              to ethical issues for bioengineering and, through publication,                 
              provide a long-term resource for the field.  Support is highly                 
              recommended.
