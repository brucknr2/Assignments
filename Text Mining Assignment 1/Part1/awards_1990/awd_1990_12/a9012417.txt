Abstract    :
              Description:  This project partially supports field expenses                   
              for two U.S. scientists, Dr. James Hunt and Dr. Robert Jeanne                  
              of the Department of Biology, Universiy of Missouri,                           
              St. Louis, while conducting research in India in collaboration                 
              with Dr. R. Gadagkar of the Indian Institute of Science in                     
              Bangalore.  In the research, work will be done on Ropalidia                    
              montana, one of the social wasps of the tropics.  It is of                     
              considerable interest as one of very few species of social                     
              paper wasps to have discrete queen/worker dimorphism.  The                     
              research will address the following questions: 1. does the                     
              species have an alarm pheromone and what is its source, 2. do                  
              the wasps use chemicals to mark trails during swarm                            
              emigration, 3. do male and female larvae yield different                       
              quantities of saliva during food exchange with adults, 4. how                  
              do larvae escape their pupal cells, and 5. what is the                         
              apparent pattern of task partitioning by forager worker                        
              wasps?.  This work will involve selection of a wasp colony and                 
              removing it from its natural habitat on high trees to an area                  
              of shrubs where observations can be made more easily.                          
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This small grant will provide funds for the two U.S.                   
              scientists to conduct research of interest, to the U.S., in                    
              the area of population biology and with the collaboration of                   
              their host at one of India's prestigeous academic and research                 
              institutes.  Funds for travel to India were made available to                  
              the scientists from other sources.  This research complements                  
              work being done by Dr. Hunt under a grant BSR8805971 from the                  
              Population Biology Program on "Nourishment, Trophallaxis and                   
              Caste in Primitvely Social Wasps".
