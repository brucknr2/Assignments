Abstract    :
              This is a continuation of a research program involving numerical               
              simulations and observations of extragalactic radio sources.  The              
              theme of this research is to study the interaction between ex-                 
              tended radio plasma the surrounding medium.  Numerically, the                  
              capabilities of the MHD code ZEUS will be significantly extended               
              to operate in three dimensions.  This code will be used to study               
              the propagation of radio jets in both two and three dimensions in              
              a variety of galaxy and cluster atmospheres.  In particular, a                 
              hydrodynamical mechanism for the confinement of hypersonic jets                
              will be studied.  The disruption of jets in cooling flow clusters              
              will also be analyzed, as well as the bending and disruption of                
              radio jets associated with tailed radio sources.  Observational-               
              ly, new VLA images of the middle and inner lobe regions of Cen-                
              taurus A at 8 and 0.3 GHz and of the peculiar classical double                 
              0816+526 will be made.  Survey work will include an investigation              
              of the properties of cD galaxies in rich clusters, observations                
              of selected x-ray clusters and rich southern clusters, and high                
              dynamic range mapping of a sample of luminous 3CR radio galaxies.
