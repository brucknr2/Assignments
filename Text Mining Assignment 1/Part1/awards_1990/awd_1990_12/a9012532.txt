Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The high field NMR Spectrometer is the single most important                   
              tool available to organic and inorganic chemists for structure                 
              determination and it is becoming a significantly useful                        
              technique for analytical chemists and biochemists.                             
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                   
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Miami University                      
              acquire a high field NMR.  The NMR will be used in the                         
              following research topics:
