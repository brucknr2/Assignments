Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a study of the extensional mechanisms in the Woodlark basin            
              where westward propagation of seafloor spreading is accompanied by             
              active continental extension in the D'Entrecasteaux islands and                
              flanking basins immediately landward of the propagator.  A suite of            
              deep seismic images will be constructed.  The aid of the project is            
              to determine:  (1) whether intra-continental extension is occurring            
              along low-angle detachment faults or normal faults, (2) whether                
              seismogenic faults can be correlated with faults observed in the               
              seismic sections, (3) the whole crustal geometry of structures that            
              bound the core complexed of Goodenough and Fergusson islands, and              
              (4) whether the transition from intra-continental extension through            
              to continental breadup reflect an evolution of extensional                     
              mechanisms.
