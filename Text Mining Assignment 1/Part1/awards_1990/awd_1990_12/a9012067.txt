Abstract    :
              Science affects and is affected by politics in many intricate and              
              important ways.  The history of science has carefully examined the             
              mutual interaction of human genetics (in the form of eugenics) and             
              politics in the 20th century.  Dr. Harrington is examining another             
              important interaction of politics and science:  holism and                     
              psychology in German from 1918-1945.  In this project, Dr.                     
              Harrington is concerned with the significance of holism as a                   
              scientific and cultural phenomenon in the German-speaking life and             
              mind sciences between the two world wards.  Building on a concept              
              of holistic psychobiology as "enchanted" science, the project makes            
              use of collective scientific biography to explore holism as a                  
              reactionary/reformist strain in 20th century science.  As such, Dr.            
              Harrington argues that holism challenges us with four levels of                
              discourse:  (1) experimental/empirical;  (2) epistemological/                  
              philosophical;  (3)  existential/religious; and (4) ideological/               
              political.  The roster of individuals chosen to serve as the                   
              focusing lens of this study are:  Hans Driesch, Jakob von Uexkuell,            
              Constantin von Monakow, Kurt Goldstein and Max Wertheimer.  By                 
              setting the lives and though of these men in social and                        
              institutional context, the book hopes to venture answers to such               
              questions as:  how far holistic psychobiology represented a                    
              "German" national phenomenon, in spite of international analogues              
              (how far one can speak of "national styles" in science at all);                
              the status and influence of holism within the international                    
              scientific community, both before and after 1933; the relationship             
              between the scientific holism of the 1920's and certain early 19th             
              century Romantic traditions (pace the "back to Goethe|" rhetoric               
              of the time); and the relationship between scientific holism and               
              various political ideologies of the 1920's and 1930's, including               
              (but not limited to) the political organicism associated with                  
              National Socialism.
