Abstract    :
                   The Missouri Botanical Garden is one of the world's most                  
              important centers for botanical research and for curation of                   
              plant specimens.  The Curators of the Herbarium are leading                    
              researchers on tropical plants, and the collections amassed at                 
              the Garden represent an enormous and unique resource for                       
              research.  Botanists from around the world visit these                         
              collections and request specimens on loan, and access to these                 
              collections is critical for hundreds of current research                       
              projects.  Unfortunately, the rate at which new collections have               
              arrived has outpaced the Garden's ability to mount, identify,                  
              label, and file specimens in the collections.  More than 300,000               
              specimens have accumulated in "backlog", and the research                      
              community has expressed strong desire for access to these                      
              specimens.  Dr. Solomon will oversee an aggressive three-year                  
              campaign to eliminate this backlog, and to put in place                        
              curatorial procedures that will prevent future backlogs from                   
              accumulating.                                                                  
                   Processing the specimen backlog at the Missouri Botanical                 
              Garden will benefit research collections around the world.                     
              Research into tropical biodiversity, medicinal use of native                   
              plants, ecological and evolutionary studies all rely on these                  
              collections, and processing the backlog into accessible                        
              collections will make the Garden's Herbarium collection a more                 
              comprehensive research resource.
