Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will conduct mathematical                      
              research in percolation and random graphs.  Both topics deal with              
              mathematical models of clustering processes, and have                          
              applications to phase transitions and critical phenomena in                    
              statistical mechanics.  The percolation theory research focuses                
              on two problems:  In classical percolation models,                             
              mathematically rigorous exact solutions for the critical                       
              probability (phase transition) value are rare.  This project                   
              continues development of a method for computing accurate upper                 
              and lower bounds for the critical probability.  AB percolation is              
              a variant of the classical percolation model,  introduced for the              
              study of antiferromagnets and gelation processes.  AB percolation              
              models behave quite differently from classical percolation                     
              models, by exhibiting multiple phase transitions in some                       
              lattices, and no phase transitions in others.  In this project                 
              the investigator will study why these differences occur.  The                  
              random graph theory research continues to explore the behavior of              
              the Erdos-Renyi random graph models near the phase transition                  
              value.
