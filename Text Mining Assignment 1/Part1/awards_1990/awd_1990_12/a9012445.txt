Abstract    :
              This study will examine the interaction of three major forces in               
              the evolution of state policies governing management of coastal                
              barrier systems: 1) short-term and long-term changes to the                    
              physical environment of coastal barriers; 2) substantive knowledge             
              and expertise about environmental change processes; and 3) the                 
              implementation of alternative policy innovations in response to                
              environmental change.  Case studies of coastal states that have                
              experienced environmental changes will be conducted to provide                 
              qualitative empirical validation of a conceptual model of                      
              institutional response to chronic environmental change.  The work              
              will also improve understanding of key relationships that stimulate            
              environmental policy innovation.                                               
                                                                                             
              Increasing concern about global environmental change has focused               
              attention on the detrimental effects that future climate change                
              might exert on natural environments and society.  This research                
              will provide valuable theory and data for aiding societal decision             
              making regarding environmental policies to plan for and protect                
              against adverse effects of climate change.
