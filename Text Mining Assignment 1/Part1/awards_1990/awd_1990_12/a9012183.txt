Abstract    :
              This is an award to support a project to determine the                         
              transport, fate, and effects produced by protozoa in a                         
              plume of organically contaminated groundwater as                               
              influenced by physical and chemical conditions of the                          
              contaminated aquifer, and to determine the role that                           
              protozoa play in influencing the numbers and kinds of                          
              bacteria that survive transport through a contaminated                         
              aquifer.  This project includes field studies in                               
              cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey (Ronald W.                         
              Harvey) at its Groundwater Contamination Site located at                       
              the Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  The                       
              project also includes a subcontract with the British                           
              Museum of Natural History (Colin R. Curds).                                    
                                                                                             
              This project addresses factors of great significance in                        
              determining the role that protozoa play in affecting                           
              microbial populations in aquifers that have been                               
              contaminated by organic chemicals.  Results may be applied                     
              in engineering design of systems for decontamination of                        
              aquifers by use of a bioremediation process alone or as                        
              part of a system including physical and chemical                               
              processes.
