Abstract    :
              Description:  This proposal supports the collaboration of                      
              Drs. J.F. Scott and L. Kazmersky of the University of                          
              Colorado at Boulder, Dr. R. Bitar, University of Jordan,                       
              Amman, Jordan and Dr. A. Shawabkah, Birzeit University, West                   
              Bank, Palestine.  The purpose of the collaboration is to                       
              produce true device equations for ferroelectric film                           
              memories.  Project funding will help support Dr. Bitar                         
              during his sabbatical stay at the University of Colorado as                    
              well as allow Dr. Scott to travel to Dr. Bitar's home                          
              institution.  Existing facilities in Jordan are capable of                     
              carrying out this research, therefore, when Dr. Bitar                          
              returns to Jordan, studies can continue.                                       
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The proposed collaboration will bring together                         
              research scientists from the U.S. and Jordan (Dr. Shawabkah                    
              is a Jordanian citizen as well as Dr. Bitar) working in the                    
              area of ferroelectric thin films.  It is anticipated that                      
              this collaborative research will result in the development                     
              of ferroelectric thin film memories.  Dr. Bitar will have an                   
              opportunity to familiarize himself with the techniques                         
              utilized by the team at the University of Colorado and then                    
              transfer this technology to facilities at his home                             
              institution.  Therefore, this proposal fulfils objectives of                   
              the Science in Developing Countries Program in its exchange                    
              and transfer of scientific knowledge through an                                
              international collaboration.
