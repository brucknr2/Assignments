Abstract    :
                   The solar magnetic field is cyclical in time and                          
              intermittent in space.  The field plays a basic role in the                    
              formation of the Sun's hot outer corona and in the twenty two                  
              year activity cycle. This study will investigate magnetic                      
              phenomena on the Sun which range from probing the interior field               
              using helioseismology to studying the evolution of the field in                
              the corona, including the generation of waves and the                          
              acceleration of particles in solar flares.  The helioseismology                
              studies will help to elucidate the structure and temporal                      
              behavior of the magnetic field in the solar interior.  The                     
              investigation of coronal magnetic field evolution will focus on                
              the formulation of singularities and the loss of equilibrium,                  
              which are important for understanding both steady state coronal                
              heating and eruptive phenomena such as flares and mass ejections.              
              The particle acceleration studies will focus on the generation of              
              hydromagnetic disturbances during the flare process and on                     
              simulations of particle interaction with these waves.  The latter              
              should have application to acceleration in a wide range of                     
              environments in addition to solar flares. Both analytical and                  
              numerical techniques based on prior studies will be employed.
