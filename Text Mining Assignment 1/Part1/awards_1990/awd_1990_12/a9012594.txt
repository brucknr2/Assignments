Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this research project is to contribute to the                   
              development of life and reliability methodology for ceramics whose             
              failure at high temperatures is controlled by the material's                   
              microstructure.  The specific microstructural influence of interest            
              is the high-temperature "wake-effect" which results from traction              
              imposed on a crack behind the crack tip by viscous ligaments,                  
              whiskers or acicular grains, and other similar microstructural                 
              elements.  It is proposed that this wake-effect will be studied for            
              three different types of ceramic materials, namely, two-phase                  
              ceramics such as liquid sintered alumina and siliconized silicon               
              carbide, whisker-reinforced ceramic composites and ceramics with               
              acicular grain structure such as certain silicon nitrides.  The                
              study will involve tests on macroscopic cracks using compact                   
              tension specimens, as well as, tests on microscopic cracks using               
              indented and creep-cracked flexural and tensile specimens.  Details            
              of the crack growth and the inelastic deformation in the vicinity              
              of the crack tip will be studied using the Digital Image                       
              Correlation technique.  The study is expected to result in the                 
              characterization of crack growth with respect to applied stress,               
              temperature, and time.  These results then will be used to                     
              construct models for crack growth and failure.
