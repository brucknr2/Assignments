Abstract    :
                   The objective of this study is to determine why a significant             
              fraction of the slip on oceanic transform faults occurs by aseismic            
              creep rather than by earthquakes.  The study will test the                     
              hypothesis that this behavior is due to the existence of serpentine            
              along the transform faults.  If serpentine exhibits velocity                   
              hardening, then the serpentine will accommodate the movement along             
              the faults through aseismic creep.  A series of experiments will be            
              conducted to determine the frictional constitutive behavior of                 
              serpentine, as well as a more exploratory series of experiments to             
              determine the constitutive behavior of basalt and peridotite.  Then            
              a realistic fault instability model for oceanic transform faults               
              will be constructed.  Together these experiments are expected to               
              result in an understanding of the observed combination of seismic              
              and aseismic slip on oceanic transform faults.
