Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PIs propose to generate a high resolution benthic oxygen                   
              and carbon isotopic stratigraphy for ODP Site 644 in the                       
              Atlantic and a Cd/Ca stratigraphy for Site 677 in equatorial                   
              Pacific to obtain a long-term record of the fluctuations and                   
              trends in North Atlantic Deep Water production and changes in                  
              marine carbon cycle.  The study will test whether there is a                   
              link between changes in deep water circulation and global                      
              climate on a longer time scale of 100,000 to a milion years.
