Abstract    :
              Our contemporary world has been radically reshaped by revolutions              
              which occurred in the late 18th century:  the American Revolution              
              which gave rise to what would become the most powerful democracy               
              in the history of the world, the French Revolution which overthrew             
              the traditional order not only in France but in all of Europe, and,            
              more surprisingly, the Chemical Revolution initiated by Antoine                
              Lavoisier.  Despite the fact that the latter two were intimately               
              linked, no study has been made showing these links.  This is the               
              project which Professor Donovan is undertaking.                                
                                                                                             
              Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) is remembered as the central figure              
              in the 18th century Chemical Revolution and as the most famous                 
              scientist to be executed in the Terror of the French Revolution.               
              Understandably, but unfortunately, Lavoisier's importance in the               
              history of science has had the effect of isolating him from the                
              history of his era, the result being that his science is usually               
              studied without reference to his many administrative activities.               
              The immediate goal of this project is to prepare a biography of                
              Lavoisier, one that will describe his science and his many                     
              administrative undertakings as closely related efforts to realize              
              a comprehensive program of reform.  The larger goal is to                      
              demonstrate that in Lavoisier's case, and by implication in other              
              cases in the 18th century, the pursuit of science was shaped by a              
              lively awareness of political and social issues and that this                  
              attention to larger contextual concerns had profound consequences              
              for the development of both science and society.
