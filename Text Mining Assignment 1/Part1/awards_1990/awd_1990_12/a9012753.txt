Abstract    :
                   This research project concerns noncommutative differential                
              geometry and topology.  This project deals with developing                     
              special functors that have been discovered by the principal                    
              investigator.  These functors are used to study systematically                 
              the dense subalgebras of certain algebras that arise in modern                 
              analysis.  These dense subalgebras carry more sensitive geometric              
              data in many areas of application.  Previously known algebraic K-              
              theory and cyclic theory functors are sensitive to this data but               
              tend to be uncomputable.  The principal investigator's functors                
              are designed to provide better access to geometric information                 
              about these dense subalgebras.                                                 
                   The project is in the general area of analysis and geometry.              
              It concerns the study of certain 'mappings', which are called                  
              functors.  These functors determine invariants of the topology                 
              and geometry of certain manifolds significant to the geometric                 
              aspects of the mathematical sciences.
