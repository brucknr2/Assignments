Abstract    :
              Natural resource extraction strongly affects the environment.                  
              The methods of extraction and export of extracted resources are                
              crucial to the environmental impact.  This project will examine                
              how planning of natural resource extraction takes place in a                   
              fragile environment--the Brazilian Amazon.  The investigator will              
              interview key actors inside and outside Brazil and examine                     
              archives of the organizations involved to determine how resource               
              extraction and export in the bauxite industry are influenced by                
              the nature of the commodity, the environment, internal and export              
              market forces, interests of importing firms or nations, and the                
              political and social organization dominant in the resource-                    
              exporting region.  This project is supported by NSF's special                  
              initiative on the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental
