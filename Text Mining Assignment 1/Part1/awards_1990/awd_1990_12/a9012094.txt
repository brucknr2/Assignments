Abstract    :
                   Mathematical models have become important to the routine                  
              functioning of commerce and government.  Models help with planning,            
              evaluating, managing and operating systems of all types.  With the             
              spread of personal computers, more models will be used by .. and               
              developed by .. more people.  Yet, even as society becomes more                
              dependent on models, we have not given enough attention to the process         
              of model formulation, either in practice or in education.                      
                   Model formulation is the first step in the modeling process:              
              moving from a vague sense of "problem" to a formal representation that         
              can be manipulated to yield solutions.  Improved, systematic methods of        
              model formulation are important to the development of "modeling                
              science" that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of modeling        
              efforts.                                                                       
                   The objectives of this research are to:  (1) Describe the model           
              formulation process as practiced by acknowledged experts; (2) Develop          
              ways to judge the success of model formulation; (3) Suggest improved           
              procedures for model formulation.  This research will be exploratory,          
              and should pave the way for experimentally verifiable propositions             
              about effective model formulation.  It should also lead to improved            
              techniques and materials for educating modelers
