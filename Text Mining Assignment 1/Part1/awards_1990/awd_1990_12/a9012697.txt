Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, the P.I. will continue operation and expand                   
              the scope of the Data Information Unit (DIU) for the World                     
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  The DIU provides a means                 
              of rapid dissemination of information among WOCE scientists,                   
              and other scientists in the community, both about data sets                    
              collected and to be collected, and about other aspects of                      
              management and organization of WOCE.
