Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The formation of submarine sulfide deposits and the activities                 
              involved in chemosynthetically-based hydrothermal food webs are two            
              processes that are energetically interdependent and spatially                  
              coincident.  Most of the important reactions occur in the                      
              subsurface and are therefore generally inaccessible to direct                  
              observation.  Recently discovered high-temperature pools of buoyant            
              hydrothermal fluid trapped beneath overhanging massive sulfide                 
              flanges in the Endeavor vent field on the Juan de Fuca ridge offer             
              an opportunity to document the physical and chemical processes                 
              occurring within well-exposed, nearly self-contained, miniature                
              hydrothermal systems that span the temperature range from 350 C to             
              ambient.  The project will mount a combined field, laboratory, and             
              theoretical study of a number of these flange-pool systems.  The               
              intent is to map thoroughly the geological, geochemical, thermal,              
              and biological relationships within a selected group of flanges,               
              then place a variety of instruments in, on, and around the flanges             
              to collect continuous information about temperature and flux                   
              variations over a period of 8 to 10 days.  TLhe flanges studied on             
              the bottom will be retrieved for laboratory dissection and analysis            
              involving 3-D mapping of the porosity, permeability, mineralogy,               
              structure, texture, fluids, and microbial distributions.
