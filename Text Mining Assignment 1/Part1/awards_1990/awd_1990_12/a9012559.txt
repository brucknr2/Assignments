Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This preliminary work will test ideas concerning the importance                
              of recombination signal-sequence directed V(D)J joining of                     
              immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene segments in the evolution              
              of immunity and self/non-self recognition.  The immediate goal of              
              the proposal is to develop conditions for microinjecting                       
              artificial recombination signal-sequence directed, DNA                         
              recombination substrates in an in vivo model system, the                       
              protochordate, Botryllus.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Botryllus, a colonial tunicate which displays histocompatibility,              
              is ideally suited for studies of the evolution of major                        
              histocompatibility complex and lymphocyte receptor recognition.                
              Success with this project should have a major impact. Not only                 
              will this study provide information about the evolution of                     
              self/non-self recognition, potentially yielding sequence                       
              information for primordial immunoglobulin and/or T-cell receptor               
              genes, it may also demonstrate a conserved mechanism, the                      
              generation of receptor diversity by gene rearrangement.  Although              
              this project involves a novel approach, the potential payoff in                
              determining whether the invertebrate to vertebrate transition                  
              involves, or is accompanied by, the acquisition of gene-                       
              rearranging machinery is worth the admittedly high risk.
