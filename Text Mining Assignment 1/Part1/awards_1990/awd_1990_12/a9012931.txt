Abstract    :
                   Three faculty members will continue their research in                     
              elementary particle physics.  In collaboration with others they                
              are using facilities at Fermilab to perform experiment E672.                   
              The object of their research is to study high energy collisions                
              in which pairs of muons are produced in association with other                 
              particles and thereby elucidate the current theory of the                      
              strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics.  They are                         
              collaborating with other NSF groups and they share apparatus                   
              with E706, performed with a large contingent of NSF supported                  
              physicists.
