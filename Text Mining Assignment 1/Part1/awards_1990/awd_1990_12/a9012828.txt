Abstract    :
                   The University of Illinois will host the Forth-Third Annual               
              Gaseous Electronics Conference in October 16-19, 1990 with                     
              partial support from the National Science Foundation.  The                     
              conference serves as a forum for low temperature plasma and                    
              related work on the boundary between basic and applied science,                
              and involves scientists from industry, academia, and national                  
              laboratories.
