Abstract    :
              Turbulent, nonpremixed combustion is to be modeled using a                     
              combination of direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large                     
              eddy simulation (LES) approaches.  The numerics will employ                    
              spectral collocation (Fourier transforms) and spectral element                 
              (Chebyshev transforms and P-type finite elements) techniques.                  
              The following physical issues will be investigated through                     
              DNS:  flame tip dynamics near extinguishment, lifted flame                     
              structure and the validation of percolation theory applied to                  
              flame sheet "holes", and the coupling between the                              
              instantaneous values of a conserved scalar and its rate of                     
              dissipation in spatially developing turbulent flames.  The LES                 
              work will be aimed at developing a subgrid turbulence closure                  
              using a scalar single-point probability density function, with                 
              application to a homogeneous turbulent flow undergoing a                       
              finite rate binary reaction.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The main objects of this research are the effects of                           
              exothermic reactions on turbulence, application of the                         
              spectral-element method to compressible reacting turbulent                     
              flows, and application of LES to finite rate reacting                          
              turbulent flows.  The results should identify shortcomings                     
              associated with some of the turbulence models presently in use                 
              and guide the way to improved techniques for closure, thus                     
              advancing our ability to reliably model more physically                        
              realistic combustion chamber flows.
