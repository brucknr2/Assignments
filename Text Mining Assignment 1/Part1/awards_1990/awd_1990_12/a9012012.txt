Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT                                                                        
                  Solar variability is one possible source of climate change.               
              The objective here is to obtain an improved observational and                  
              theoretical understanding of the dynamical effects of short-term               
              solar ultraviolet variations in the upper stratosphere.  Detailed              
              cross-spectral studies of zonal mean temperatures, winds, and                  
              derived circulation statistics versus the measured solar flux                  
              near 200 nm  will be conducted to determine the existence and                  
              statistical significance of dynamical changes in the stratosphere              
              produced by solar UV variations.  Special attention will be given              
              to the possibility that solar UV variations may force or excite                
              traveling planetary-scale waves with preferred periods near 27                 
              days in the upper stratosphere (1-3 mbar). Interference between                
              short-term solar UV-driven transient waves and stationary waves                
              forced from below may be capable of affecting the initiation of                
              stratospheric warmings in the northern hemisphere winter with                  
              consequent effects on the interannual climatology of the middle                
              atmosphere.  ***
