Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Thomas will study the effects of small scale turbulence on                 
              phytoplankton using a series of laboratory devices designed to                 
              expose the algae to varying levels of motion.He will then measure              
              the growth rates and productivity of the organisms as well as                  
              their pigment composition, cell sizes and behavior to determine                
              the impacts of the increased turbulence upon their physiology. It              
              is hypothesized that the growth inhibition of dinoflagellates by               
              small scale turbulence is the reason that red tides do not occur               
              with moderate to strong wind conditions. This will aid in the                  
              prediction of the occurrence of many of the toxic outbreaks of                 
              red tides in the coastal regions.
