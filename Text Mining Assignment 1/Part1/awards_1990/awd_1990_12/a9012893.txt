Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigator proposes to address issues associated                         
              with college student's perceptions of success and how                          
              these perceptions vary based on demographic factors such                       
              as age, gender, race, income status, philosophical                             
              orientation, geographical environment, and educational and                     
              employment levels.  The purpose is to fully understand how                     
              motivation for academic performance, and so academic                           
              performance varies among the previously stated strata of                       
              college students.  The planning phase of the research will                     
              substantiate variations in motivation, or the lack                             
              thereof, controlling for age and current level of                              
              education.  The results from this phase will be used to                        
              develop a proposal to create a survey instrument based on                      
              the instrument developed by the Higher Educational                             
              Research Institute.  This survey will be distributed to a                      
              sample of students representing a cross section of the                         
              population based on the demographics previously mentioned                      
              but with a wider range in categories including age,                            
              economic level, income level, etc.  The instrument will be                     
              distributed to participants in the eastern, central and                        
              western portions of the United States.  This approach                          
              provides a variety of people and native and transient                          
                                                                                             
              populations.
