Abstract    :
              In this research project supported by the Inorganic, Bio-                      
              inorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program, Richard J.                     
              Lagow of the University of Texas at Austin will continue work                  
              in the area of polylithium organic compounds, such as di- and                  
              tri-lithiomethane, hexalithiobenzene, perlithioadamantane and                  
              perlithiocyclopropane. In addition, the existence of hyper-                    
              valent compounds such as penta- and hexa-lithiocarbon will be                  
              investigated. These polylithium compounds are very unusual and                 
              highly reactive molecules which have high energy densities.                    
              They may find utility as new materials or in new types of solid                
              or liquid batteries.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Studies will include syntheses (generally via lithium vapor                    
              chlorocarbon replacement reactions), characterizations by x-ray                
              crystallography, mass spectroscopy, and nobel gas matrix spec-                 
              troscopy and investigations of chemical reactivities.
