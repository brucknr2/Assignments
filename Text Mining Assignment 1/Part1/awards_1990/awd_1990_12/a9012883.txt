Abstract    :
              This conference will provide a comprehensive perspective on RecA               
              and related protins by bringing together for the first time                    
              scientists working on the biology, genetics, enzymology and                    
              structure of RecA and related proteins from prokaryotes to mammals.            
                                                                                             
              The meeting will be organized to encourage interaction and informal            
              discussion; the goal being to allow scientists working on RecA from            
              different disciplines to educate each other as to the approaches               
              and understanding they have of this area.  The meeting should have             
              an impact on a number of fields because of the variety of processes            
              that are controlled by RecA.
