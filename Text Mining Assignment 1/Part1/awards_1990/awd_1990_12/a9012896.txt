Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this proposal is to study how sequence and                    
              solution salt concentration influence the structural,                          
              thermodynamic and kinetic properties of a DNA-RNA hybrid oligomer.             
              Questions to be addressed are:  Do DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes exist               
              only as A-form helices or do they display a sequence dependent                 
              shape?, What is the role of nearest neighbor sequence determining              
              the stability of a hybrid duplex? and  How does salt concentration             
              affect the physical properties and behavior of hybrid molecules?               
                                                                                             
              Work will include:                                                             
                                                                                             
              1. Circular dichroism studies of hybrid duplex conformation as a               
                 function of sequence and salt concentration                                 
              2. Optical melting studies to develop a basis set of free energy               
                 parameters for the prediction of stability and conformation of              
                 hybrid duplexes in 1.0 M Na+                                                
              3. Optical melting studies of the effects of salt on the                       
                 thermodynamics of duplex formation                                          
              4. The construction of a laser Raman temperature jump                          
                 spectrophotometer to measure kinetic properties of hybrid                   
                 duplex formation as a function of base sequence and salt                    
                 concentration.
