Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Two investigators will analyze problems arising from the                  
              study of geometric partial differential equations.  One will                   
              study questions related to asymptotics for geometric extrema,                  
              including questions about growth properties of entire solutions                
              of the minimal surface equation and more general quasilinear                   
              elliptic equations.  He will also work toward a solution of the                
              long-standing Willmore conjecture.  The second investigator will               
              study the structure of singular sets of minimal surfaces,                      
              asymptotic behavior of harmonic maps near singularities, and                   
              topological types of minimal submanifolds.                                     
                   Both investigators will analyze problems which involve                    
              understanding how partial differential equations act on minimal                
              surfaces.  These equations include derivatives of functions of                 
              more than one variable and frequently have their origins in                    
              applied mathematics.  Minimal surfaces are the mathematician's                 
              model of common soap films.  In recent years the use of partial                
              differential equations in connection with minimal surfaces has                 
              seen an explosion of research activity.
