Abstract    :
                   The University of Georgia's Marine Institute on Sapelo                    
              Island has been the site of coastal research since 1953.                       
              Investigators into salt marsh environments have used this                      
              research facility as resident and visiting scientists, and the                 
              Institute has undergone renewed growth during the past decade.                 
              Due to its remote location, separated from the mainland by six                 
              miles of marshland, the Institute is subject to electrical                     
              brownouts and complete power failures.  Dr. James Alberts,                     
              Director of the Institute, proposes to install an uninterruptible              
              power source.  This backup system would eliminate brownouts and                
              would provide continuous electricity for 30 minutes following                  
              power failures.  The Institute's backup generator system would                 
              provide electricity beyond this 30 minute interval.                            
                   The proposed installation of an uninterruptible power source              
              would have an important impact on the Institute's research                     
              capabilities.  Researchers at the Institute must rely on                       
              uninterrupted electricity for controlled growing environments,                 
              culture growth chambers, and continuous environmental monitoring               
              systems.  Brownouts and power failures can destroy months and                  
              years of research effort.  The proposed power supply will support              
              continued growth of the Institute's research impact.
