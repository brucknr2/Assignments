Abstract    :
                   Flash floods are major meteorological disasters which occur               
              around the globe.  Understanding of this phenomena is a                        
              challenging problem because it is necessary to understand both                 
              complex dynamic and microphysical processes at scales of motion                
              that are smaller than typically measured by conventional weather               
              networks.  This scale of motion is termed mesoscale by                         
              meteorologists.                                                                
                   The National Science Council of Taiwan has established a                  
              Multiple Hazards Mitigation Project whose meteorological                       
              component is focussed on improving flash flood predictions.  A                 
              major field project to study the systems that cause flash floods,              
              entitled the Taiwan Area Mesoscale Experiment, was held in the                 
              Spring of 1987.  The project was cosponsored by the National                   
              Science Council with participation of the National Science                     
              Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric                            
              Administration of the United States.                                           
                   The Principal Investigator participated in the field                      
              expedition and his preliminary research on the data has revealed               
              the structure of subtropical mesoscale convective systems and the              
              differences and similarities with mid-latitude systems.  Such                  
              comparisons have not received much attention in the past.  The                 
              Principal Investigator will continue this research with special                
              attention to comparing the dynamic and thermodynamic                           
              characteristics of two convective systems that possessed very                  
              different precipitation characteristics.
