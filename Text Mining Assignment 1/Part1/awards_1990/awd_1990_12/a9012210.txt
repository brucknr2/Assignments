Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with shape algebras of reductive               
              algebraic groups.  The principal investigator will consider their              
              q-deformation and tensor operators on the flag manifolds.                      
              Roughly speaking, an algebraic group is a group which satisfies                
              a polynomial.  These groups have become increasingly important in              
              mathematics and physics.  Shape algebras provide a model of these              
              algebraic groups.  The aim of this research is to verify                       
              properties of the simpler shape algebra and then show that they                
              translate to properties of the algebraic group.
