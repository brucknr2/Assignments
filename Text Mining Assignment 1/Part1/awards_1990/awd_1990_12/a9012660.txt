Abstract    :
                   High power radio waves directed to the upper atmosphere and               
              ionosphere can produce major perturbations in composition,                     
              produce optical emissions and create additional radio waves at                 
              various frequencies.  In the past one experiment produced ultra                
              low frequency waves as detected by a sensitive receiver near by.               
              This result has been difficult to repeat.  This project by the                 
              original investigator is to repeat the experiment using new                    
              equipment to try to validate the earlier results.
