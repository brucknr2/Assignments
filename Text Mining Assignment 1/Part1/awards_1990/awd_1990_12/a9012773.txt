Abstract    :
              Agarwal         The goal of the Alewife experiment is to demonstrate that a 
              parallel computer system can be made both scalable and easily  programmable. 
              To achieve this end, a scalable parallel computer  system called Alewife is
              being designed, built and evaluated as  the experimental vehicle for this
              project.  The system is a mesh-  connected set of processor nodes, each
              consisting of a slightly  modified SPARC processor, called SPARCLE, some main
              memory and  cache, a Caltech route chip, and a custom memory management 
              circuit, all on a custom PC board.
