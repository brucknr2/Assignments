Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Corliss is awarded funds to continue his research with                     
              Dr.Thunell (University of S.Carolina) in the investigation of                  
              the Quaternary paleoceanography of the Sulu and South China                    
              Seas. Sediment deposition in these two basins is controlled by                 
              intervening sills that greatly inhibit the exhange of bottom                   
              water. During a cruise in 1988 Drs. Corliss and Thunell                        
              collected transects of cores along these sills to document                     
              changing paleoceanographic conditions during                                   
              glacial/interglacial cycles of the late Pleistocene. With their                
              present award they will complete their core analyses and extend                
              them to include studies of living benthic foraminifera                         
              collected in their box cores.  The ecologic and isotopic                       
              information derived in this manner will be used to reconstruct                 
              the history of changes of the late Quaternary paleoenvironments                
              of the region.  Their data will also be used to reconstruct the                
              late Quaternary history of monsoonal circulation of the western                
              equatorial Pacific; they intend to compare this history with                   
              results derived from other studies of the NW Indian Ocean.
