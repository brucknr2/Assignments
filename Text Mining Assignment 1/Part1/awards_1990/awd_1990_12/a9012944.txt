Abstract    :
                   Bodega Marine Laboratory is a coastal research facility                   
              operated by the University of California at Davis.  The Lab is                 
              located north of San Francisco, and has provided research                      
              facilities for resident and visiting scientists since 1966.  Dr.               
              James Clegg, Director of the Lab, proposes construction of a                   
              state-of-the-art facility for molecular biology.  The proposed                 
              facility would support isolation of organic compounds, protein                 
              electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction amplification of                    
              nucleic acid sequences, and full capabilities for amino acid, DNA              
              and RNA sequencing.                                                            
                   Marine biologists are becoming increasingly dependent on the              
              tools of molecular biology for their research.  Marine                         
              microbiologists, population biologists, systematists, marine                   
              ecologists, and physiologists regularly turn to molecular                      
              techniques to identify organisms and to analyze their metabolic                
              properties.  The proposed facility will foster new research                    
              collaborations and will increase the Bodega Marine Lab's impact                
              as a community resource among biologists.
