Abstract    :
              In this project, the P.I.'s will continue numerical and analytical             
              studies of strongly nonlinear interactions of eddies and their                 
              environment.  Specific focus will be on eddy splitting, thick                  
              eddies in an ocean at rest and interacting with shear, rings and               
              western boundaries, and convection and internal waves in Gulf                  
              Stream rings.
