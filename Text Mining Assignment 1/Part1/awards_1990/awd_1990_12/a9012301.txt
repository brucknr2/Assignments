Abstract    :
                   The research of Prof. Isenberg involves primarily two                     
              areas of study:  (1)  The dynamics of gravitational fields and                 
              their behavior near singularities in spacetimes satisfying                     
              Einstein's equations; and (2)  The convergence and                             
              nonconvergence of Ricci flows of Reimannian metrics on three-                  
              dimensional manifolds.  While the interest in the first area                   
              comes from physics and that in the second area is mathematical,                
              in both areas the analysis focuses on geometrically-based                      
              systems of partial differential equations.  Moreover, in both,                 
              the most pressing (and difficult) issues involve the long-time                 
              behavior of the solutions, and the behavior of the fields as                   
              they become singular.  Therefore it is not surprising that the                 
              progress achieved in the two areas has been often based on the                 
              use of somewhat similar tools.  Also not surprising is the                     
              considerable cross-fertilization which has occurred between the                
              physically-motivated ideas and mathematically-based concepts                   
              which are used in studying both problems.
