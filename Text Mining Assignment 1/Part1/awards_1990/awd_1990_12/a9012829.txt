Abstract    :
                   The Fourth International Congress of Systematic and                       
              Evolutionary Biology will be held at the College Park Campus of                
              the University of Maryland from June 30 to July 7, 1990.  The                  
              theme of the Congress "The Unity of Systematic and Evolutionary                
              Biology" will bring together an international assemblage of                    
              systematists, population biologists, and ecologists, as well as                
              members of the "user community", for which systematics is a                    
              critical but undervalued resource (e.g., agroeconomists,                       
              government policy specialists, conservationists, and                           
              biotechnologists).  The Congress will host sessions on a variety               
                                                                                             
              of topics, several of which will be devoted to the main themes                 
              of: 1) Evolution in Perspective: Biodiversity, Conservation,                   
              Biotechnology, and Global Change; 2) Evolutionary Mechanisms and               
                                                                                             
              Processes; and 3) Systematics and Phylogenetic Reconstructions.                
                                                                                             
              Ten scientific societies will also be sponsoring symposia at the

                   Dr. Reaka's proposal to the National Science Foundation                   
              addresses the critical issue of human resources in systematic and

              graduate students, members of under-represented groups of U.S.                 
              scientists, and investigators from lesser-developed countries to
