Abstract    :
              In order to understand the properties of nucleic acids and the                 
              mechanisms by which they are recognized by proteins, it is                     
              essential to understand the details of fine structure and couple               
              the sequence and structure data.  Our goal is to develop a database            
              of nucleic acid structures and structural features so as to allow              
              computer queries about structural characteristics, correlations of             
              features among structures, and sequence-structure relationships.               
              The achieve this goal, all of the available primary and calculated             
              information about crystal structures of nucleic acids will be                  
              assembled into a relational database.  The system that will be                 
              created will be portable and accessible to chemists and biologists             
              in a large number of computer environments.
