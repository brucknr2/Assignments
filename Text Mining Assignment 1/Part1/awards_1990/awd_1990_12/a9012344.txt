Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests funds for development of the downhole                   
              sensors, design of a valved port through which borehole fluids                 
              can be drawn from depth, and construction of these components                  
              for six borehole seals to be deployed by the Ocean Drilling                    
              Program.
