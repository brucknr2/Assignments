Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The primary goal of the RIDGE initiative is to understand                 
              the interlinked geophysical, geochemical and geobiological causes              
              and consequences of energy transfer within the global ridge                    
              system through time. A key facet of this program involves                      
              providing strong support for theoretical integration of field and              
              laboratory studies of ridge-crest processes. The purpose ofthe                 
              Summer Institute is to provide an environment of progresson                    
              critical theorectical RIDGE problems that require an inter-                    
              disciplinary approach. Topics for the Summer Institute will                    
              reflect the range of disciplines comprised by the RIDGE                        
              initiative. The topic for 1990 is mantle flow, melt generation,                
              and lithospheric deformation at ridge crests. The Institute will               
              consist of a short course open to all interested parties, and an               
              intensive two-week workshop for approximately 30 researchers and               
              students. The RIDGE Summer Institute represents a unique                       
              contribution offered by the RIDGE initiative to integrate                      
              theoretical, sea-going, and laboratory-based components of the                 
              community involed in ridge-crest research.
