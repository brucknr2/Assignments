Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In accordance with the Agreement on Scientific Cooperation                     
              Between the National Academy of Sciences and the Academy of                    
              Sciences of the USSR, the NAS plans to hold a bilateral                        
              workshop on "Photosynthesis and Related Processes and their                    
              Relationship to Plant Productivity" in Woods Hole,                             
              Massachusetts, from September 15-20, 1990.                                     
                                                                                             
              Biochemists, organic chemists, and physicists who have dealt                   
              with photosynthesis and chemical reactions have made major                     
              contributions.  Trained in the physical sciences, these                        
              students of photosynthesis have studied reactions in                           
              chlorophyllous cells, although they have neglected some of                     
              the biological aspects.  Meanwhile, plant scientists,                          
              particularly physiologists, agronomists, and geneticists,                      
              have increased their interest in enhancing plant productivity                  
              by optimizing photosynthetic activity.  The themes and the                     
              composition of both the Soviet and the American delegations                    
              represent a mix consistent with the historical development of                  
              the workshop topic.//
