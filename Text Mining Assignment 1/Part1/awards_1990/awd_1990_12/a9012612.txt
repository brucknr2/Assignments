Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Processes driving the baroclinic circulation in the Gulf of Maine              
              will be investigated by using a three-dimensional numerical                    
              model.  Extensions in the use of Finite Element Methods to                     
              complicated coastal regions will result as well as better                      
              understanding of circulation within the Gulf of Maine.
