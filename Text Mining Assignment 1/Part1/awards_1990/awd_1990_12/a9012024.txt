Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigator proposes to study the development of the Holocene             
              Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to elucidate its response to past                 
              climatic and eustatic changes and to use this record as an analog              
              for the kinds of changes that will occur with future global                    
              warming.  With the funds from this planning grant, the PI will                 
              locate areas with a high potential for preservation of early                   
              Holocene stratigraphy, sample sediments from these areas and                   
              determine which laboratory methods will best address the problem               
              posed above.  This preliminary research will be divided into the               
              following phases:  1) initial map and aerial photographic                      
              investigation; 2) field investigation; 3) laboratory                           
              investigation; 4) grant writing and continued library and map                  
              research.
