Abstract    :
                   Under a previous award, the co-principal investigators                    
              studied, using cross correlation techniques, the upper level                   
              (tropospheric) circulation anomalies associated with tropical                  
              convection over the Indian and Pacific Oceans on various times                 
              scales during the Northern Hemisphere winter.  Their analyses                  
              suggest that tropical convective activity (and the attendant                   
              atmospheric heating), on the timescale of 14-30 days, generates                
              planetary scale waves sources in subtropical regions which have a              
              significant impact on the east Asian subtropical jet and                       
              planetary scale wave patterns in the midlatitudes.  In contrast,               
              it appears that convective activity in the eastern Pacific on                  
              shorter timescales (6-14 days) is more likely to be affected by                
              extratropical disturbances.                                                    
                   With this award, Drs. Kiladis and Weickmann will extend                   
              their previous results (cross correlation) to other seasons and                
              other regions of the globe.  They also will begin some studies                 
              using a simple linear model to explore the mechanism(s) by which               
              tropical heating influences extratropical circulation patterns.                
              This research should provide insights into the dynamical links                 
              between the tropics and extratropics and ultimately contribute                 
              to improving the models used for medium range forecasting.
