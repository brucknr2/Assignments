Abstract    :
              Two fundamental problems in marine zooplankton ecology are 1) poor             
              understanding of the micro-scale distribution of organisms and 2)              
              lack of ability to collect synoptic or even quasi-synoptic                     
              taxonomic data.  Dr. Davis and collaborators propose to assemble a             
              Video Plankton Recorder (VPR), from available technology, which                
              will measure the distribution of zooplankton and identify them to              
              major taxa (copepods, chaetognaths, etc) in quasi-real-time at                 
              towing speeds of 1-10 knots with along-track spatial resolution of             
              5-30 um.  They will then use the VPR to sample micro-meso-scale                
              distributions of zooplankton in a wide variety of hydrographic                 
              regimes along a transect line from Woods Hole to the Sargasso Sea.             
              These data will provide insights into the prevalence of micro-scale            
              patchiness under various hydrographic and wind conditions and will             
              reveal the spatial relationships within and among taxa along a                 
              continuum of scales from microns to kilometers.
