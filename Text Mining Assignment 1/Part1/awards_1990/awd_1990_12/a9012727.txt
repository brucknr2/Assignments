Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a two.year collaborative project between                               
              Nan Lin, Professor of Sociology, Duke University,                              
              and Pan Yunkang, Director of the Institute of                                  
              Sociology of the Tianjin Academy of Social                                     
              Sciences, Tianjin, China.  It will build upon a                                
              preliminary study conducted in 1985 in Tianjin,                                
              China's third largest city.  It is sponsored                                   
              jointly by the NSF and the Tianjin Academy of                                  
              Social Sciences.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The investigators will try to determine how                                    
              Chinese search for and find jobs by conducting a                               
              sample survey of 2,000 presently employed males and                            
              females between the ages of 18 and 60 who have                                 
              entered the labor force since 1949 (the founding                               
              of the People's Republic of China).  The                                       
              investigators have assumed that it is more                                    
              important for the Chinese to enter into the                                    
              "right" work units than to find "good" jobs.  The                              
              "right" work units tend to be in the state sector,                             
              under the direct jurisdiction of the central                                   
              government.  The work units under other, lower.level                           
              governments, called the collective sector, tend to                             
              be less prestigious because they pay less, have                                
              fewer promotions, have less fringe benefits, and                               
              have less authority relative to the state.owned                                
              work units.  The investigators will test the                                   
              following hypotheses:  (1) males rather than                                   
              females are more likely to enter into the state                                
              sector and work units, (2) males are more likely                               
              than females to be helped by their family (parents                             
              and relatives) than females in getting into the                                
              state sector, (3) males are more likely than                                   
              females to find social connections through family                              
              ties to enter into the state sector.                                           
                                                                                             
              The study will increase our understanding of social                            
              connections in contemporary Chinese society, which                             
              is undergoing rapid economic and social change.                                
              It will also help make comparisons across different                            
              societies and cultures (e.g., comparing with North                             
              American and European countries) as to how people                              
              move ahead successfully in their careers.
