Abstract    :
              A singular implicit differential equation is an implicit ordinary              
              differential equation of the form F(y',y,u,t) = 0 where y is a vector          
              valued function, the Jacobian Fy' is a singular matrix, u is a vector          
              valued function, and t is time.  Such implicit systems frequently              
              arise in a variety of control problems in flight control, robotics,            
              and contact or constrained problems in mechanics.  In addition,                
              implicit differential equations occur in the solution of partial               
              differential equations by the method of lines and in many circuit              
              models.  Singular systems are frequently called differential algebraic         
              equations (DAEs) or discriptor systems.                                        
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to develop methods for analyzing nonlinear implicit             
              differential equations and computing their solutions.  These results           
              will also be of interest when the state equations exist, but the               
              sparsity, nonlinearity, or dependence on parameters of the equations,          
              make the original implicit system preferable to a lower order, but             
              non-sparse, (or difficult to compute local) explicit state system.             
              The numerical computation of control theoretic information directly            
              from the original equations will be investigated as part of the                
              proposed research.
