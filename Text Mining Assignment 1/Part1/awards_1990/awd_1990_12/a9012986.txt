Abstract    :
              In this project, P.I.'s will deploy three inverted echo sounders               
              (IES) at the Hawaiian Ocean Time Series station north of Oahu,                 
              Hawaii.  The objective is to evaluate the feasibility of using                 
              IES's to monitor dynamic height at the deep-water station,  This               
              added continuous component to the measurement of the variability               
              will allow resolution of smaller space and time scales otherwise               
              inaccessible to existing measurements.
