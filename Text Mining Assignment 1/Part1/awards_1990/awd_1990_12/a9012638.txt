Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will focus on the spectroscopic characterization of              
              polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and their interactions with             
              proteins.  Peroxidases have been recently studied as plausible                 
              candidates for the biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic compounds             
              and other highly dangerous dioxin pollutants.  This study will                 
              include a complete determination of the optical properties of the              
              heme prosthetic group upon adduct formation, and an assessment of              
              the kinetic and thermodynamic manifestation in relation to the                 
              proposed oxidizing mechanism of PAH pollutants by peroxidases.                 
              Haloperoxidases, lactoperoxidases and myeloperoxidases will be                 
              prepared and characterized and their interaction with aromatic                 
              compounds such as 2,4,6-trochlorophenol will be studied to clarify             
              the general mechanisms of action of peroxidases with PAH                       
              compounds.  The interaction of PAH compounds with DNA and the role             
              of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the biodegradation of hazardous                  
              materials will also be studied.
