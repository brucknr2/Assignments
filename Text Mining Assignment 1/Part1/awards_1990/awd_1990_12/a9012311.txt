Abstract    :
              In the history of technology, nothing is more mysterious yet more              
              central that the act of invention.  Technological historians,                  
              however, have yet to develop a precise interpretation of how an                
              inventor identifies an opportunity, develops a new idea, and                   
              manifests it in a physical device.  In response to this conceptual             
              lacuna, Drs. Carlson and Gorman are comparing how Alexander Graham             
              Bell, Thomas A. Edison, and Elisha Gray developed the telephone                
              from 1870 to 1880.  They have chosen to focus on these inventors               
              because their work is well documented by notebooks, sketches, and              
              artifacts and because their efforts to perfect this invention have             
              received limited scholarly attention.  To analyze and compare the              
              works of these inventors, they are drawing on recent work in                   
              cognitive science.  In particular, they are considering three                  
              elements of the cognitive process of invention:  how an inventor               
              conceptualizes an invention (mental model);  the strategies he or              
              she uses to develop an invention (heuristics); and the specific                
              technical devices he or she uses to construct an invention                     
              (mechanical representations).  Through this research, they expect              
              to enrich the history of technology with a new conceptual framework            
              and a detailed study of a major invention, suggest to cognitive                
              scientists how technological creativity may be effectively studied,            
              and help interested laymen see inventors not as mysterious geniuses            
              but as individuals with specific talents and skills.
