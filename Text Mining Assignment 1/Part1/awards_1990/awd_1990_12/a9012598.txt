Abstract    :
              The last ten years have witnessed a significant restructuring in               
              much of the American corporate sector, with the economic value of              
              merger and acquisition activity totalling nearly $180 billion for              
              both 1985 and 1986. The magnitude of these activities has                      
              attracted considerable attention and the empirical evidence                    
              clearly indicates that the shareholders of target firms benefit                
              substantially from successful takeovers, with virtually no gains               
              for the shareholders of acquiring firms. An important aspect of                
              this phenomenon is the source of these gains. Specifically are                 
              these the synergistic gains of economic efficiency or do they                  
              represent at least in part a redistribution of firm value from                 
              organizational stakeholders to shareholders? This study provides               
              a direct test of the hypothesis that some of these shareholder                 
              gains come at the expense of unionized labor. Given prior work                 
              establishing that union wage and benefit premia come at the                    
              expense of shareholders, a change in corporate control is one                  
              more issue that enters the relationship between labor and                      
              management over the distribution of firm value. The first part of              
              the study will test the hypothesis about the distribution of                   
              shareholder gains based on the merger and acquisition experience               
              of 468 publicly traded firms from 1982-86. A unique unionization               
              database is developed at the firm level based on information                   
              available from the U.S. Treasury/ Department of Labor. The second              
              part of the project will include a case study of 5 - 10 firms in               
              the sample.
