Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial support for a Chapman                         
              Conference on Global Biomass Burning:  Atmospheric, Climate,                   
              and Biospheric Implications.  Chapman Conferences are topical                  
              meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union.  This                    
              conference is designed to create opportunities for discussion                  
              not normally available through the format of larger meetings.                  
              The Conference will bring together a group of recognized                       
              experts for a discussion of the multi disciplinary scientific                  
              aspects of biomass burning.  Regional and global effects of                    
              biomass burning will be explored by specialists in the relevant                
              biological, atmospheric and earth sciences and in fire                         
              management.  A conference- proceedings volume will record the                  
              information and viewpoints presented by participants for use by                
              the scientific and public-interest communities.  Research in                   
              this area of growing world-wide interest is expected to                        
              accelerate in the near future.  To help facilitate the growth                  
              of the needed research effort this grant supports the                          
              attendance and participation of graduate students having                       
              relevant interest in this field of research by providing for                   
              travel and subsistence costs.                                                  
                   The Conference will be held at Williamsburg, Virginia,                    
              March 19-23, 1990.
