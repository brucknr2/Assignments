Abstract    :
              This project is devoted to surface x-ray scattering studies of                 
              epitaxial growth onto perfect crystal substrates.  Part of the                 
              effort will be devoted to an extension of exact results of                     
              dynamical diffraction theory to surface diffraction, to complement             
              current descriptions based on kinematical theory.  Measurements                
              will be made on clean silicon and germanium surfaces in ultra-high             
              vacuum using the triple crystal diffraction (TCD) method.                      
              Experiments will then proceed with monolayer coverages of lattice-             
              matched alkali halides epitaxially grown onto Ge surfaces, with                
              both TCD and x-ray standing wave (XSW) measurements being used to              
              solve the "phase problem."  The studies will also be extended to               
              thicker layers of alkali halides, in part to monitor the                       
              interference between the substrate and overlayer diffraction in the            
              XSW and TCD spectra.  This x-ray analog of reflection high energy              
              electron diffraction oscillations will be analyzed theoretically               
              using appropriate computational models.
