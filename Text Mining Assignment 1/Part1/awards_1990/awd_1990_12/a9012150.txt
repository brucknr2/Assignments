Abstract    :
              Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Cornell University                    
              will collaborate on an ocean sciences instrumentation                          
              development project to upgrade a MOCNESS (Multiple Opening /                   
              Closing Net and Environmental Sensor System) by adding a dual                  
              beam bio-acoustic sonar system plus an electro-fiber optic                     
              cable.  The project represents the next logical step in                        
              improving the quality of data collected by these widely used                   
              systems that are employed in studies of plankton distribution                  
              and ecology.  The dual beam bioacoustic sonar will enable                      
              scientists to correlate acoustic signals with animals                          
              actually captured in the net system.  Investigations of                        
              animal distributions will be improved by being able to modify                  
              ongoing sampling programs based on concurrent data, and study                  
              small scale distributions of organisms relative to what the                    
              net captured.  The data stream from the bioacoustic sonar                      
              plus the environmental sensors exceeds the telemetry                           
              capability of currently used electro-mechanical cables.  The                   
              new system will make use of rapidly advancing fiber-optic                      
              cable technology that can carry larger data streams.  The                      
              system will have broad application in planned ocean science                    
              research initiatives.
