Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project, sponsored by Bridgewater State                        
              College, will provide a three week summer program each year                    
              for three years for teachers of science and mathematics.                       
              Teachers of mathematics will be taught science and teachers                    
              of science will be taught mathematics so that science and                      
              mathematics will be integrated in the science and                              
              mathematics courses.  Sixty teachers from the state of                         
              Massachusetts will be selected each year, 30 in mathematics                    
              and 30 in science.  Teachers from grades 10-12 will                            
              participate the first year, teachers in grades 7-9 the                         
              second year and teachers in grades 9-11 in the third year.                     
              Teachers will be selected in teams and are expected to                         
              carryout inservice activities upon return to the schools.                      
              There will be nine follow-up sessions which will support and                   
              assess the participants' activities in the classroom and                       
              their efforts in leadership activities.                                        
                                                                                             
              Matching funds from the college and the schools amount to more                 
              than 26% of the NSF grant.
