Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Pittsburgh State University will initiate a three-week, residential        
              Young Scholars project in Chemistry and Biology for 36 students entering       
              grades 8,9.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The students' interest, confidence, and enthusiasm for science will be         
              heightened.  This age group was selected to affect future curricula            
              choices.  Participants learn basic research methodology, gain discipline       
              content, and perform research under the direction of senior faculty.           
              Ethical considerations are integrated into daily activities.  Special          
              sessions focus on the values and philosophies practitioners and citizens       
              must consider.  Career Exploration opportunities include developing            
              "Personal Plans" and visits to regional practitioners of science to see        
              "what scientists do."                                                          
                                                                                             
              Follow-up involves school visits, campus speakers, and student                 
              presentations in the Junior Science Academy.  Project assessment               
              includes short and long term follow up.
