              for 25 students entering grade 12.                                             
                                                                                             
              University faculty members and cooperating federal scientists                  
              will deliver lectures, lead discussions, conduct field trips and               
              provide students with research experiences.                                    
                                                                                             
              Follow-up activities include the use of a newsletter to exchange
