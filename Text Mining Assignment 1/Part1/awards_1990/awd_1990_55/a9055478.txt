Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This proposal describes a collaborative effort between                         
              Wright State University faculty and the Trotwood-Madison                       
              (T-M) City School District to support the new textbook-free                    
              science curriculum at T-M with a strong science enhancement                    
              program for the 96 elementary classroom teachers in the                        
              district.  Scientists and science educators from Wright                        
              State University will provide training in hands-on science                     
              in the life (1st year) and physical sciences (2nd year),                       
              utilizing modular materials such as Fast Plants and Gems.                      
              The program will include 2 three-week summer sessions (5                       
              days/week, 6-8 hours/day), continuing education workshops                      
              throughout the school-year, end-of-year workshops, follow-                     
              up visits and guest lectures.  In addition, Wright State                       
              faculty will, on occasion, become "substitute teachers" to                     
              provide no-cost development time for the T-M teachers.                         
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because it contains a strong science enhancement                       
              program designed to reach all of the elementary classroom                      
              teachers in the targeted school district.  It will provide                     
              teacher participants with opportunities to learn life and                      
              physical science concepts and science processes, and                           
              effective teaching methods.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately or 32% of the amount                     
              requested from NSF.
