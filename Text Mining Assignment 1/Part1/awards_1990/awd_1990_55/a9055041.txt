Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Northwest College will initiate a four-week, residential Young                 
              Scholars project in Environmental Biology and Chemistry, and                   
              Physical and Historical Geology for 20 students entering grade                 
              12.                                                                            
                                                                                             
              Students will learn basic principles of these disciplines and                  
              will subsequently use these principles to design and carry out an              
              environmental study of the Gibbon River in the Yellowstone                     
              National Park.  The research has three major components:                       
              collection of field samples, analysis of samples and data, and                 
              writing of a scientific report based on the research results.
