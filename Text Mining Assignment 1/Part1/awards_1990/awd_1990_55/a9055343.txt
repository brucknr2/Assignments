Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 3-year project, "Curriculum Resources for Earth Science                   
              Teachers" (CREST), is designed to provide 192 elementary and                   
              secondary teachers with resources and field and laboratory                     
              experiences to meet the need for improved earth science instruction            
              in Maine's public schools.  The project would: (1) increase knowledge          
              of science applications by having teachers work with earth scientists          
              in a summer intern program; (2) prepare curriculum materials,                  
              including field trip guidebook, classroom activity and source books,           
              videotaped programs, and rock/mineral reference collections; and (3)           
              facilitate teacher communication and learning through conferences,             
              newsletters, electronic bulletin boards, and interactive TV broadcasts.        
                                                                                             
              Each year 10 teachers will be selected to participate as summer                
              interns, spending 6 weeks working on a research project with a                 
              professional earth scientist.                                                  
                                                                                             
              These earth science teachers will directly benefit from the multi-             
              disciplinary research network that exists among the MGS and other              
              State and Federal agencies, and Maine colleges and universities.               
              Many of the curriculum materials prepared through CREST will be                
              applicable and transferable to earth science programs in the schools           
              of other states.  The cost-sharing is more than 27% of the amount              
              requested from National Science Foundation.
