Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a three year program that offers five-week                     
              teacher enhancement summer institutes, followed by academic                    
              year curriculum development activity.  The summer institutes                   
              will be held at Mankato State University.  A total of 72                       
              middle school science teachers (24 per year), from a six                       
              state Midwest region, will participate in summer research                      
              experiences and presentations in the subject area of soil                      
              biology/agroecology.  Teachers will have the opportunity to                    
              study the organisms in soils, apply what they learn to                         
              issues in agroecology, and participate in writing, testing,                    
              and revision of classroom materials.  Laboratory materials                     
              to be used are readily available to participant teachers and                   
              their students for in-class experimentation and study.                         
              Research projects undertaken by the participants will be                       
              designed for transport back to the home classroom to engage                    
              students in the projects, and will not require complex                         
              instrumentation and techniques.                                                
                                                                                             
              Each teacher will provide in-service training for                              
              colleagues.  Included will be 6 one-week workshops conducted                   
              by two teacher teams at different locations within the                         
              region.  At least 60 additional teachers will be trained in                    
              these workshops to conduct similar research activities with                    
              their students.  These workshops will be funded, in part, by                   
              local funding.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              An amount equal to 20.5 % of NSF costs has been provided as                    
              cost sharing.
