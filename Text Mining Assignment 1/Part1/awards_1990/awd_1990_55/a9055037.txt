Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Washington College will continue a three-week, residential Young               
              Scholars project in Forensic Science for 20 students entering                  
              grades 11,12.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Lecture sessions provide the theory of "wet" and instrumental                  
              chemical analytical methods and pose chemical and criminal                     
              puzzles.  In the laboratory, student sleuths begin with                        
              fingerprinting and blood typing and end in use of the Washington               
              College Chemistry Department's research-grade instrumentation to               
              gather evidence for presentation at a mock trial.
