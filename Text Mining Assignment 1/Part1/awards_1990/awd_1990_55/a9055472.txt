Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a three year program for high school biology                   
              and agriculture education teachers that includes 1) three                      
              summer institutes to be held at The University of                              
              Wisconsin - River Falls, and 2) a series of twelve 2-4 day                     
              regional workshops led by institute participants.                              
              University faculty will assist in the teaching of the                          
              workshops.  The summer institutes are an improved version of                   
              a successful institute piloted during the summer of 1990                       
              with Wisconsin NDEA Title II funds.                                            
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this program is to provide over 300 high                        
              school and agriculture education teachers with new knowledge                   
              and teaching skills in the area of biotechnology.  This                        
              program is unique in that applications of plant and animal                     
              biotechnology will be featured.  It is also unique in that                     
              opportunities for biology and agriculture education teachers                   
              to work together will be emphasized.  Master teachers from                     
              previous summer institutes will participate as institute                       
              staff so as to share successful classroom experiences and                      
              teaching strategies.                                                           
                                                                                             
              An amount equal to 11% of the NSF award will be provided as                    
              cost sharing.
