Abstract    :
              Negative attitudes prevent students from doing well in the                     
              introductory chemistry laboratory course and enjoying the subject.             
              To deal with the problems of anxiety and naivete among entering                
              students, we will develop a two-day workshop called "Reduce Your               
              Lab Anxiety" to be offered several times each year.  This ungraded             
              workshop will introduce unconfident or underprepared students to               
              the expectations of a lab course.                                              
              We will also develop a new laboratory entitled "Science in                     
              Practice" to accompany the pre-general chemistry course.  This                 
              course will target the same clientele as the workshop.  Through new            
              exercises based on everyday substances and processes, it will                  
              provide a solid technical foundation for the courses that follow.              
              A guidebook will be made available to report these developments.
