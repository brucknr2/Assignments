Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Michigan State University seeks funds for a three-year                         
              program to promote the improvement of the teaching of                          
              mathematics to middle school minority students.  This will                     
              be accomplished through a three-week summer workshop for                       
              Professional Development Teams of middle school mathematics                    
              teachers and support people (secondary or college                              
              mathematics teachers, supervisors or administrators) from                      
              eleven urban school districts in Michigan.  Current                            
              exemplary materials in the teaching of algebra, geometry and                   
              visualization, probability and statistics, and contributions                   
              of African-Americans to mathematics will be used.                              
              Participants my earn six hours of graduate credit for the                      
              summer workshop. School year follow-up activities will                         
              include two, one-day conferences and two visits by staff                       
              members to each of the school districts.                                       
                                                                                             
              Each year 45 middle school mathematics teachers and support                    
              people will be enhanced and expected to return to their                        
              schools as teacher-leaders to enhance an additional 225                        
              second-wave teachers.  In all 810 teachers and support                         
              people should be enhanced during the lifetime of the                           
              project.  Michigan State University's cost-sharing will                        
              account for 13% of the NSF budget.                                             
                                                                                             
              Reaching, teaching and retaining minority students in                          
              mathematics is an NSF and indeed a national goal of the                        
              highest priority. This project has the potential of                            
              providing a prototypic model for an in-service delivery                        
              system capable of empowering teachers to achieve this goal.
