Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a model, university-schools collaborative program                      
              for utilizing a cadre of 100 elementary school teachers, who                   
              have participated in a three year Science Teacher Institute                    
              at the University of California, San Diego.  This project                      
              will support these teachers with the design and delivery of                    
              staff development programs in science education at the                         
              elementary school level as well as selecting an elementary                     
              science curriculum for their school sites or districts.  The                   
              two-year project is a joint effort of the science faculty of                   
              the University of California, San Diego, in cooperation with                   
              and in response to the needs of the San Diego County school                    
              districts.  The project includes materials and technical                       
              assistance for these teacher leaders as they attempt to                        
              change the way science is taught to young children in their                    
              districts.  It is estimated that over three thousand                           
              teachers will take part in the three to five day inservice                     
              programs that these 100 teachers will design and implement                     
              in their districts.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing for the project will be 22% of the NSF                        
              portion.
