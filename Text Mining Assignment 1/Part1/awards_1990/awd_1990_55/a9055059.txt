Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Toledo will initiate a three-week, residential Young         
              Scholars project in Chemical Engineering for 40 students entering              
              grades 11,12.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The UT Chemical Engineering Summer Workshop is designed to introduce           
              high school students to the career opportunities available to them in          
              engineering.  Through a combination of experience:  group discussions,         
              laboratory experimentation, hands-on computer work, independent group          
              investigations and field trips, the Workshop participants will receive         
              an exciting introduction to the field of engineering.  Additionally, the       
              ethics of engineering and science will also be carefully explored in an        
              interesting videotaped session and group discussion.                           
                                                                                             
              Follow-up activities planned in the academic year include engineering          
              experiments led by the Workshop participants in their home school              
              science classes, field trips with the University Student Chemical              
              Engineering Chapter and invitations to the UT annual engineering college       
              open house.
