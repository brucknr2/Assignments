Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics will actively engage       
              60 students entering grades 10-12 and 10 faculty in the creation of a          
              lively and rigorous environment in which mathematics is created, shared,       
              and enjoyed.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              For six weeks faculty and students will live together and work together        
              in small workshops and problem seminars which meet for 37 hours each           
              week.  Challenging problems from outside the usual secondary and college       
              curricula will be intensively investigated, but emphasis will be placed        
              on the methods of discover and proof rather than on the mere                   
              accumulation of results.
