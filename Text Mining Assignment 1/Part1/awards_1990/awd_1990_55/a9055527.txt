Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal will provide training over a three-year period                   
              to enhance the teaching capabilities of two different groups                   
              of teachers, one with a background in science, and the other                   
              with a background in the education of mildly handicapped                       
              children. The participants are middle school/junior high                       
              certified teachers of science or special education who teach                   
              science to children classified as learning disabled or                         
              emotionally disturbed.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The project includes two waves of 24 trainees for three                        
              years in a summer program with follow-up sessions during the                   
              academic year.  Approximately 60% of the sessions are                          
              devoted to content and the remainder to teaching methods and                   
              clinical experiences with handicapped children.                                
                                                                                             
              In summary, the project has potential for increasing the                       
              teaching effectiveness of middle school/junior high teachers                   
              in science to children with learning disabilities.                             
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 11% of the NSF award.
