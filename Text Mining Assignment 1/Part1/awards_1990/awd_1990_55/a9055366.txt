Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Project TEAM (Technology, Empowerment, and Mathematics) is a                   
              three-year effort to enhance mathematics learning of                           
              elementary and middle school students, through teacher                         
              enhancement, in the Boston Public Schools. TEAM builds on the                  
              successful NSF-funded EMAT (Elementary Mathematics and                         
              Technology) Project, which also was conducted in Boston. The                   
              project will complete the preparation of two mathematics                       
              teacher leaders in every elementary school in Boston and will                  
              develop a cadre of middle school mathematics teacher leaders                   
              in each of Boston's middle schools. In each year of the                        
              project, a cadre of forty teachers (20 elementary, 20 middle                   
              school) will participate in a two-week summer institute,                       
              followed by monthly meetings during the academic year.                         
              Leadership teams will be established within each cadre.                        
              Academic year activity includes implementation of project                      
              ideas in participants' classroom, continued inservice each                     
              month, and telecommunications networking among participants.                   
              In the second and third years of the project, participants                     
              will conduct inservice activities with Eisenhower support at                   
              the local level. Typical sessions in the previous project were                 
              15 hours long. Existing curriculum material produced in the                    
              Boston area will serve as a basis for teacher adaptation and                   
              revision.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The project is initiated by the Boston Public Schools, and                     
              involves collaboration with mathematics educators at Boston                    
              University and the University of Massachusetts at Boston. Cost                 
              sharing is provided by the Boston Public Schools as 76% of the                 
              NSF award.
