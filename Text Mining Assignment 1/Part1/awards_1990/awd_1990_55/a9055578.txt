Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University                   
              will use this award from the Chemical Research Instrumentation                 
              Program and the National Facilities and Instrumentation Program                
              to help acquire a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)                            
              spectrometer.  The areas of chemical research that will be                     
              enhanced by the acquisition include the following:  FTIR                       
              Studies of Interactions in Polymer Blends, IR-Microscope                       
              Studies of Phase Separation in Polymer Blends, Crystallization                 
              from Polymer Blends, New Conducting Polymers, FT-Raman Studies                 
              of Various Highly Fluorescing and Colored Samples, The                         
              management of Optical Constants of Materials, New IR Studies of                
              Acid-Base Interactions, FT-Raman Studies of Metal Clusters on                  
              Polymer Surfaces and Far-IR Studies of Thin Films and Surfaces.                
                                                                                             
              Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique                  
              that used absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular                     
              structure.  When used in conjunction with a modern computer,                   
              FTIR studies on large numbers of samples can be conveniently                   
              carried out and the resulting data readily analyzed.  The use                  
              of FTIR spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying                 
              out research in many important frontier areas.
