Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Denver will initiate a three-week, commuter and              
              residential Young Scholars project in Engineering for 50 students              
              entering grades 11,12.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project encourages capable high school students to elect an               
              engineering career by immersion in an expose' of the profession.  This         
              national program covers all engineering disciplines but focuses on             
              electrical and mechanical engineering.  During the summer portion,             
              students discuss engineering careers and professional ethics; visit with       
              engineers in industry, university research and government; use the             
              computer as an engineering tool; and practice engineering analysis and         
              design.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Special Academy periods provide year-long motivation and guidance.
