Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project is sponsored by the University of                      
              Washington and will provide an intensive four week summer program              
              for well prepared teachers of chemistry.  Thirty teachers will be              
              selected each year on a competitive basis from the Northwest,                  
              including Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming.              
              The focus of the program will be environmental chemistry.  The                 
              course will entail learning of content, development of teaching                
              demonstrations, working with modern instrumentation and computers              
              and microscale experiments.  The teachers will also participate                
              in a contemporary issues seminar.  Teachers will be taking topics              
              relating to inservice activities and will be expected to assume                
              teacher leadership responsibilities after the program is over.                 
                                                                                             
              The amount of cost share in this proposal is equivalent to 36% of              
              the NSF funds.
