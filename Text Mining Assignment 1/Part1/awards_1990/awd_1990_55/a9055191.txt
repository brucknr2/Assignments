Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Harry S. Truman College, in collaboration with Argonne                     
              National Laboratories and the Chicago Board of Education, will                 
              initiate a seven-week, commuter Young Scholars project in Ecology              
              for 60 students entering grades 10,11.                                         
                                                                                             
              The program, "Chicago as an Ecosystem," will introduce                         
              participants to an understanding of the systems -- water, solid                
              waste, air, parks, nature preserves -- and their symbiosis that                
              undergird the city, through a combination of classroom,                        
              laboratory and field work.
