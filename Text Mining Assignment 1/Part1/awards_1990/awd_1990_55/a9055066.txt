Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Boston University's PROMYS program is an intensive six-week,                   
              residential Young Scholars project in Mathematics for an                       
              ambitious group of 60 students entering grades 10-12.  PROMYS                  
              serves 45 first-year students and 15 returning students.                       
                                                                                             
              The heart of the program is the experience gained by students                  
              through their individual and collective efforts to solve an                    
              assortment of challenging problems in Number Theory.  In 1991,                 
              students will also study Abstract Algebra, Algebraic Curves and                
              Combinatorics.  Diverse weekly guest lectures introduce                        
              participants to related scientific fields, philosophical and                   
              ethical questions and career options in mathematics and science.
