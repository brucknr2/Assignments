Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Indiana University will initiate an eight-week, residential,                   
              multidisciplinary Young Scholars project in Astronomy, Biology,                
              Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Mathematics, Physics and                 
              Psychology for 50 students entering grades 11-12.                              
                                                                                             
              During the first two weeks of the project participants will have the           
              opportunity to learn about research methodology and to explore career          
              options in science and mathematics through a series of lectures, field         
              trips and hands-on experiences.  During the last six weeks of the              
              program students will work as apprentice scientists on specially               
              designed research projects under the auspices of University faculty            
              members.  Throughout the program emphasis will be placed on philosophy         
              and ethics of science, careers in science and mathematics, and the             
              interrelationships of all the science areas.
