Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year project sponsored by the University of Nebraska-               
              Lincoln, will develop a multi-media guide, called the Chemistry                
              Laboratory Assistant, to help high school teachers develop high                
              quality laboratories in chemistry in the nation's high schools. The            
              objective of Chemistry Laboratory Assistant is to help the teacher             
              manage hands-on chemistry classroom activities. The project will do            
              this by developing computer software which makes use of the                    
              hypermedia programs available on personal computers. This software             
              will help teachers prepare materials for an extremely wide range of            
              experiments currently in use in high school chemistry courses                  
              throughout the country. The software will be developed using input             
              from teams of leading chemistry teachers and the software interface            
              will be designed in accord with guidance from state science                    
              supervisors. The software will include procedures for preparing                
              solutions, for storage and disposal of substances, for inventory and           
              for scaling amounts to fit the experimental pedagogy. Tutorials for            
              student assistants and beginning or cross-over teachers will be                
              included. The software will be modifiable to meet the chemical-usage           
              requirements of the individual states. Dissemination will occur at             
              NSF summer workshops and booths at national meetings. The software             
              will be mailed to 1500 former summer workshop participants identified          
              by the project director from participant lists. Matching funds for             
              the project from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln total more than            
              12% of the NSF funds.
