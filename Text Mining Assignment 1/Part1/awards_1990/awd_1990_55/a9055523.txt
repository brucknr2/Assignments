Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two year project, sponsored by the University of Southern                 
              Illinois Edwardsville (SIUE), will provide content and pedagogy                
              instruction to less well-qualified Junior High School teachers in              
              minority schools in the East St. Louis Illinois region.  Each                  
              summer 20 teachers in science and 20 teachers in mathematics will              
              attend a six-week summer workshop and participate in an academic               
              year follow-up.  A coordinated workshop for 12 principals will                 
              also be included.  The science teachers will study biology and                 
              physical science with an emphasis on using microcomputers to                   
              increase learning.  The mathematics teachers will learn                        
              techniques of teaching problem solving and application of                      
              microcomputers in geometry and algebra.  Both groups of teachers               
              will learn techniques for instructional improvement particularly               
              those which are effective with minority students.  The follow-up               
              activities include classroom visits by SIUE faculty and meeting                
              with teachers in the summer once a month throughout the academic               
              year.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The matching funds from SIUE and the target schools is 31% of the              
              NSF award
