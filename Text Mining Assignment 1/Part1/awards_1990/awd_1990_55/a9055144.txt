Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Old Dominion University will initiate a four-week, residential                 
              Young Scholars project in Applied Physics and Engineering for 22               
              students entering grades 9,10.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This project will  (1) provide enrichment and hands-on                         
              experiences to enhance participants' knowledge of applied physics              
              and engineering,  (2) offer participants the opportunity to                    
              explore careers in several disciplines involving substantial                   
              applications of physics, and  (3) foster meaningful interactions               
              between participants and scientists/engineers working in these                 
              fields.
