Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project teams elementary school teachers with middle                      
              and high school teachers who are veterans of a previous                        
              project (ASSIST: TPE-8751767) in a summer institute for                        
              science teachers to be held at the University of Michigan                      
              Biological Station.  The summer program will be                                
              characterized by flexibility and options to meet the varying                   
              needs of veteran and new participants.  During the first                       
              year following the summer session, participants will                           
              implement in their classrooms one or more of the units                         
              introduced during the summer session.  During the second                       
              summer, secondary and elementary teacher teams will work                       
              with their respective administrators to develop a program of                   
              professional development to be implemented in their schools.                   
              Project staff will provide support and site visits during                      
              the first year of implementation.  Formative and summative                     
              evaluations, a Winter Reunion, site visits by staff, and                       
              assessments when units are implemented are means by which                      
              the project's effectiveness will be evaluated.                                 
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because it (1) is designed to enhance the science                      
              knowledge and teaching of elementary school teachers through                   
              a emersion in a nature setting as they explore biological                      
              concepts and phenomena and learn appropriate methodology and                   
              materials to use in their elementary school classrooms; (2)                    
              provides veterans (high school teachers) of a previous                         
              enhancement program the opportunity to deepen and build upon                   
              knowledge acquired during participation in that program; and                   
              (3) contains an amplification plan which will be developed                     
              and implemented by teams composed of veteran (high school),                    
              and elementary teachers, and their school administrators.                      
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost sharing is $61,524 or approximately 11% of the                    
              amount requested from NSF.
