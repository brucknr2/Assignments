Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  ASTRONOMY - HOW DO WE KNOW?  is a 4100 sq. ft. exhibit and                
              program package for Discovery Place that will: 1) interpret the                
              physical and chemical nature of astronomical bodies in the                     
              Universe, highlighting the scientific processes used in their                  
              discovery,  2) interpret, through interactive exhibits and                     
              programs, the basic technologies of the scientific study of                    
              astronomy, and  3) function as the complementary exhibition                    
              area to the new Spitz Space Voyager Planetarium system and its                 
              multi-dimensional program capabilities.                                        
                                                                                             
                   ASTRONOMY - HOW DO WE KNOW?  will make the science of                     
              astronomy more accessible to the public by demonstrating the                   
              above objectives through the fundamental concepts of Gravity,                  
              Light, Motion and Distance.  Visitors will leave with a greater                
              understanding of the process of learning about the Universe.                   
                                                                                             
                   Discovery Place will utilize the formative evaluation                     
              process in developing these exhibits to assure a product that                  
              will not only appeal to a broad audience, but will also meet a                 
              variety of identified needs within that audience.                              
                                                                                             
                   The exhibit and program package will open in October,                     
              1992, with an anticipated yearly attendance of 700,000.  The                   
              exhibits will be a permanent part of the museum and will be
