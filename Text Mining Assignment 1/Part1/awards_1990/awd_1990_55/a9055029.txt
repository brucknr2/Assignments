              The College of Sciences at Louisiana State University in                       
              Shreveport will initiate an eight-week, commuter Young Scholars                
              project in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics and               
              Physics for 20 students entering grades 10-12.                                 
                                                                                             
              The project will involve courses specially designed for the                    
              participants in the morning, and research with university faculty              
              mentors in the afternoon.  Typical research projects will                      
              involve:  genetic variation in salt tolerant and sensitive                     
              varieties of cotton, identification of cardenolides in monarch                 
              butterflies, effectiveness of the neighborhood watch program, and              
              applying Snyder's coincidence classes to parameter passing in                  
              Ada.
