              The College of Science and Mathematics at Southwest Missouri                   
              State University will initiate a four.week, residential Young                  
              Scholars project in Mathematics for 30 students entering grades

              Participants will design a landfill for a hypothetical city                    
              called Model City, USA.  Emphasis will be on problem solving and               
              mathematical modeling.  Trips to Monsanto and McDonnell Douglas                
              will be conducted to provide participants interaction with
