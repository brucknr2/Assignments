Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute will initiate       
              a three-week, residential Young Scholars project in Agricultural Science       
              for 36 students entering grades 8,9.                                           
                                                                                             
              Project activities include enrichment activities focusing on the               
              potential of agricultural careers; opportunities to participate in             
              laboratory and field experiences with a practicing scientist serving as        
              a mentor; a conference where students will present their findings and          
              discuss the ethical implications of the project; career exploration            
              activities designed to build confidence in the decision-making process;
