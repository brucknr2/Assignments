Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Tennessee Technological University will initiate a four-week,              
              residential and commuter Young Scholars project in Engineering                 
              for 50 students entering grades 11,12.                                         
                                                                                             
              Fifty students, primarily from the Southern Appalachian region,                
              will be selected to participate in this enrichment program which               
              will consist of lectures in the Introduction to Engineering                    
              series, Engineering Design, Energy and Environmental Engineering               
              and extensive research assignments.  Participants will also                    
              develop a proficiency in Fortran 77 programming on the main                    
              University computer system and on microcomputers.  They will also              
              work in design teams to develop an engineering design of a device              
              or system.  Field trips will be taken to the Arnold Engineering                
              Development Center (U.S. Air Force), to a TVA power plant, and to              
              a local industry.                                                              
                                                                                             
              A follow-up research project is planned.
