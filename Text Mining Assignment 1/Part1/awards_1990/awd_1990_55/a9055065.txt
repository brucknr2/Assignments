              The University of North Carolina Mathematics and Science                       
              Education Network (MSEN) will initiate a five-week, commuter                   
              Young Scholars (EAI) project in physics and mathematics for 480                
              students entering grades 7,8.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Students will participate in experimental learning activities in               
              mathematics, physics, career exploration, communication in the                 
              classroom, field activities, and small group interaction.  The                 
              project will be planned and implemented through the Network                    
              (MSEN) headquarters and will be offered to minority and female                 
              students at six campuses within the UNC System.
