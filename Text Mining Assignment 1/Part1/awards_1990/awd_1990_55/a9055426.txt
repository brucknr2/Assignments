Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This approximately two-year project targets primarily                          
              teachers of elementary schools in Texas, and would involve                     
              teachers of grades 4-6 during the first year and teachers of                   
              grades K-3 during the 2nd year.  During each yearly cycle,                     
              24 participants from across the state of Texas will come to                    
              Concordia Lutheran College, Austin, Texas, for a 4-week                        
              summer workshop involving classroom, laboratory, and field                     
              experiences.  During the following school year, the Project                    
              Director and Senior Associate will conduct four Saturday                       
              workshops in each of four regions of the state to address                      
              the expressed needs and concerns of teachers in that region.                   
              They will also visit each participant's school and assist in                   
              the implementation of science concepts and methods learned                     
              during the summer.  Teachers who have completed one year in                    
              the program will return the for several days during the                        
              following summer workshop to share their experiences with                      
              the new group of teachers, and to design school-specific                       
              plans to radically improve science education in their                          
              schools.  On one of the workshop days, principals will join                    
              the teachers to collaborate with and support them in                           
              developing the plan for their schools.                                         
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because it (1) is designed to enhance the science                      
              knowledge and teaching of teachers by utilizing the local                      
              environment and focusing on phenomena appropriate for                          
              elementary school science; (2) contains an amplification                       
              plan which will accommodate the limitations and                                
              idiosyncracies of individual schools while enhancing the                       
              teaching of science in all of the grades in each school; and                   
              (3) targets an under-represented (rural) group;                                
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost sharing is approximately 8.5% of the amount                       
              requested from NSF.
