Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project from Cal State L.A. is designed to educate                        
              teachers to be leaders of hands-on science instruction in                      
              their elementary schools.  The two workshops will train a                      
              total of fifty teachers to become science mentor specialists                   
              in using hands-on science materials and to understand the                      
              physical science concepts appropriate for elementary schools.                  
              The workshops will provide the mentor teachers with lesson                     
              plans and well-organized kits of materials for each hands-on                   
              unit, as well as raining in the use of these materials and                     
              how to educate teachers about them.  The mentors will                          
              correlate the physical science units their school curriculum                   
              and inservice teaches at each grade level.  There will be two                  
              teachers from each school represented so that each teacher                     
              will inservice half of the teachers at their school.  Thus                     
              the program will develop a total school program of hands on                    
              physical science.  Each participating school will provide a                    
              stipend to the teacher for conducting the inservice of their                   
              colleagues, release time for such activity, and cost share                     
              the science kits which will be given to each school.  Project                  
              evaluation, problem sharing, and long range planning will be                   
              accomplished at two support sessions for all mentor teachers                   
              scheduled during the school year.  Additional support will                     
              also be provided by the PIs at their individual schools                        
              during the year as they attempt to improve the teaching of                     
              science in their school.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing will be 38% of the NSF portion.
