Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Wisconsin at Superior will initiate a six-week,              
              residential Young Scholars program in Ecology for 20 students entering         
              grades 10,11.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Through a series of classroom, field, and laboratory experiences               
              participants will become acquainted with the techniques used to monitor        
              the physical, chemical, and biological health of aquatic communities.          
              Students will also be introduced to the fields of environmental                
              toxicology and bioremediation.  They will then be challenged to use            
              their knowledge to design and carry out a group assessment of portions         
              of the Lake Superior watershed.                                                
                                                                                             
              The training that students receive in this program will enable them to         
              develop independent study projects which will be completed at their            
              local schools.
