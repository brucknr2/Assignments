Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year demonstration project is designed to                           
              educate 75 New York City elementary school teachers from                       
              approximately 15 schools to develop materials from the                         
              urban environment as the vehicle for science teaching in                       
              their 4th, 5th and 6th grade classrooms.  Objectives that                      
              are unique to the project are: (1) to  identify issues from                    
              the urban environment which lend themselves to elementary                      
              classroom learning; (2) to provide opportunities for                           
              teachers to use artifacts and issues from the children's                       
              immediate urban environment as the raw material for                            
              elementary science investigation; and (3) to demonstrate                       
              how the NY State Elementary Science requirements can be                        
              motivated using issues which are both familiar and                             
              important to children.  Participating schools will remain                      
              part of the project for all three years, and active                            
              involvement of administrators will be engaged to guarantee                     
              school-wide dissemination.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because it targets a needy urban student population                    
              and because it plans to develop a cadre of master teachers                     
              who will mentor their colleagues and work with school                          
              administrators to plan school-wide dissemination of the                        
              project.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 78% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
