Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Institute for Secondary Mathematics and Computer Science                   
              Education is a national program at Kent State University for                   
              secondary school teachers of mathematics and computer science,                 
              and was funded originally through Teacher Enhancement in 1988.                 
              The original program has been streamlined and reshaped to                      
              include a substantial emphasis on implementation and school                    
              change. In the summers of 1991 and 1992 a cadre of 60 teachers                 
              will study topics in computer science, data analysis, discrete                 
              mathematics, number theory, geometry, and abstract algebra.                    
              Current thinking from research in mathematics pedagogy                         
              pervades the program. The summer institute is six weeks long.                  
              As a central feature, teachers prepare to implement project                    
              philosophy and ideas in their classrooms and schools through                   
              the development of instructional units and preparation to                      
              conduct inservice. During the academic year, project staff and                 
              previous participants will support teachers in their                           
              implementation and outreach efforts through local meetings and                 
              school visits. Institute participants are brought together                     
              twice annually in a formal conference, and meet in small                       
              groups at other times. It is an expectation that participants                  
              or participant teams from a region conduct a series of four                    
              day-long inservices sessions locally. Project staff includes                   
              nationally known mathematicians, computer scientists, and                      
              educators. This program is attempting to make a transition to                  
              a permanent, self-supporting institute, and efforts toward                     
              this transition are central to the current project.                            
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is provided by Kent State University and the Ohio                 
              Board of Regents as 19 % of the NSF award.
