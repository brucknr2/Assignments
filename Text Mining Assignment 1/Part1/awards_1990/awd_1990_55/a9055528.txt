Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop the Summer Mathematics and Science                   
              Courses for Elementary Teachers portion of the Minority                        
              Mathematics and Science Education Cooperative (MMSEC).  These                  
              courses are the third phase of MMSEC's 3-year comprehensive                    
              training of elementary teachers in mathematics and science                     
              content and teaching methodology.  When completed these                        
              courses will offer teacher university -level content courses                   
              in science and mathematics which will support earlier                          
              activities of academic year inservice workshops and summer                     
              trainers' institutes.  These earlier programs provided                         
              teachers with strong, creative teaching methods based on                       
              hands-on inquiry learning and contextual knowledge and                         
              understanding needed to improve the deficient performance and                  
              classroom achievements of minority children.  The eight Texas                  
              sites for this project --San Antonio, Ft. Worth, Arlington,                    
              Dallas, Nacogdoches, Beaumont/Port Arthur, Edinburg, and                       
              Laredo-- and the eight institutions of higher education --                     
              Stephen Austin State University, Texas Christian University,                   
              University of Texas at San Antonio, Lamar University,                          
              University of Texas at Pan American, Laredo State University,                  
              University of Texas at Dallas, and Tarrant County Junior                       
              College -- along with the support of the Texas Higher                          
              Education Coordinating Board form a powerful partnership to                    
              improve the teaching of mathematics and science in                             
              predominantly minority schools.  It is estimated that through                  
              this partnership 536 teachers will be educated and over 10,616                 
              students will be reached indirectly.
