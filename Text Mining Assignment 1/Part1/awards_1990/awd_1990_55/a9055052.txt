Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The GMI Engineering & Management Institute will initiate a three-week,         
              commuter Young Scholars project in the fields of Chemistry and Physics         
              for 30 students entering grade 9.                                              
                                                                                             
              The selected students will participate in hands-on science activities          
              involving chemical analysis and measurements, environmental chemistry,         
              polymer science, lasers, holography, and investigations of the                 
              properties of light.  Activities have been selected that are both              
              exciting and educational.  Participants will be divided into small             
              groups to conduct a short research project.  A portion of the three-week       
              workshop will involve career awareness activities such as question and         
              answer sessions with visiting scientists and engineers and field trips.        
                                                                                             
              The nine monthly follow-up activities will involve hands-on science            
              activities, dynamic speakers, field trips, and competitive events.
