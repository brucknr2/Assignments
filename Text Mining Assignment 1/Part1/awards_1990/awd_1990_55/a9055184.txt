Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Ohio State University will continue an 8-week, residential                 
              Young Scholars project in Mathematics for 57 students entering                 
              grades 9-12.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Activities in discrete mathematics and number theory will provide              
              a basis for development of reasoned argument.  The project will                
              include visits by mathematicians and scientists working "in the                
              field."
