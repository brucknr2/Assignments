Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  Building on a network previously established under an                     
              NSF grant, Simmons College proposes to strengthen and expand                   
              the activities of pre-college science teacher-leaders in New                   
              England, with emphasis on environmental science education in                   
              the region.  Twenty middle school teachers and twenty high                     
              school teachers will take part in two summer workshops and                     
              will work in small teams during the academic year to develop                   
              science teaching activities.  An electronic network will                       
              facilitate communications and data exchange between the                        
              participants.  In addition, participants will be prepared to                   
              serve as teacher-leaders and will disseminate information on                   
              resources and teaching strategies to colleagues in their                       
              home districts through a series of workshops.                                  
              Cost sharing on this project is 42.5% of the NSF                               
              contribution.
