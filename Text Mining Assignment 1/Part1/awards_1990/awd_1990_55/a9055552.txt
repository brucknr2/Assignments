Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The California Academy of Sciences produces a science news                
              radio feature "EARTHNEWS" which has aired daily on twelve radio                
              stations in California for nine years.  "EARTHNEWS" is a                       
              background to regular news and provides in-depth interpretation                
              of science and environmental events to assist the public in                    
              understanding what they hear or read.  In response to a very                   
              large volume of mail from listeners, a quarterly newsletter was                
              created four years ago to announce program schedules, enhance                  
              the information presented on the radio, and offer scientists                   
              and teachers a written forum for sharing ideas.                                
                                                                                             
                   Positive response from the listening audience suggests                    
              that this feature has tremendous potential for reaching a broad                
              national audience.  The Columbia Broadcasting System has agreed                
              to air three 60-second "EARTHNEWS" features each week and to                   
              distribute these features nationwide via satellite.  A total of                
              156 features will be produced annually, each reaching an                       
              estimated national audience of twelve to fifteen million                       
              people.  The California Academy of Sciences is requesting                      
              funding for program research and production to develop this                    
              national radio program and to continue production of the                       
              newsletter.
