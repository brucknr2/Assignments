Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project sponsored by St. Paul's school of Concord, NH,                    
              will provide an interdisciplinary four week summer program                     
              covering topics in science, and the history and philosophy                     
              of science.  The first year will offer the physical sciences                   
              and the second and third year will offer the life sciences.                    
              Each year twenty teachers will participate in the project.                     
              They will be selected in teams, each team consisting of at                     
              least one teacher from the sciences and one teacher from the                   
              humanities.  Upon returning to the schools the teachers will                   
              develop interdisciplinary courses intended for non-science                     
              students based upon the content learned during the summer                      
              session.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The matching funds provided by the schools are equal to 10%                    
              of the NSF award.
