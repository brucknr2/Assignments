Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Hawaii will initiate a six-week, residential                 
              Young Scholars project in Environmental Science for 40 students                
              entering grades 10-12.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Students will study an urban estuary and explore potential                     
              environmental enhancement.  Studies will include biological,                   
              chemical, geological, and physical assessment and evaluation of                
              potential environmental enhancement using a civil engineering                  
              approach and computer modeling.
