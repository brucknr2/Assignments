Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Western Mathematics Scholars Program is a regional teacher                 
              enhancement effort for teachers of grades seven through twelve                 
              in Colorado, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and                         
              Wyoming. Each of 126 teachers will participate in the program                  
              for two full summers and academic years. The program includes                  
              a five-week summer institute, to be offered each of two                        
              summers at three campus sites (South Dakota School of Mines                    
              and Technology, Chadron State College in Nebraska, and                         
              Cheyenne Community College in Wyoming.)                                        
                                                                                             
              Each summer, 42 teachers will participate at each site. They                   
              will take courses in discrete mathematics, data analysis,                      
              geometric perspectives, and modeling with modern technology.                   
              Each course includes concept exploration and development,                      
              together with laboratory sessions focusing on classroom                        
              implementation. Special speakers and extra sessions are                        
              included; as part of the teacher enhancement process,                          
              exemplary modules demonstrating the use of project approaches                  
              in classrooms will be developed by the participants.                           
                                                                                             
              During the academic year, teachers will implement project                      
              ideas in their classrooms, conduct inservice activities in                     
              their local areas, and attend regional followup meetings. The                  
              project extends the successful model of the Nebraska                           
              Mathematics Scholars program (TPE 8550604) by providing                        
              opportunities for teachers throughout five states to become                    
              involved.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The project is administered through the University of                          
              Nebraska-Lincoln; subcontracts are included for Colorado State                 
              University, the University of South Dakota, Minot State                        
              University in North Dakota, and the University of Wyoming.                     
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is provided by participants' schools and other                    
              sources as 19% of the NSF award.
