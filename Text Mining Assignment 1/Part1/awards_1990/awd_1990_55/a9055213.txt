Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Northeast Louisiana University will initiate a three-week,                     
              residential Young Scholars project in Computer Science for 30                  
              students entering grades 8,9.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Participants will be introduced to the fundamental concepts of                 
              computer science and will have hands-on experience with topics                 
              such as graphics, robotics, expert systems, telecommunications,                
              and databases.  Students will be divided into groups to conduct                
              research projects.  The program will include field trips to local              
              industries to learn about possible careers in science and                      
              mathematics and evening events will include invited speakers to                
              further discuss such potential careers.                                        
                                                                                             
              Follow-up will continue throughout the academic year and students              
              will return for two days the following summer to complete these                
              activities.
