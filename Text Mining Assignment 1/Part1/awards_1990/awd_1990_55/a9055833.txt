Abstract    :
              The principal investigators, Dr. Judith Miller, Dr. Ronald                     
              Cheetham, and Dr. John Wilkes, have designed and conducted a novel             
              freshman biology sequence in which the student take an active role             
              in learning.  Students work in small groups to solve problems which            
              they have helped to devise.  Laboratories are individually paced               
              and culminate in independent investigations.  Philosophy,                      
              mechanics, subjective results, and partial quantitative results                
              support the conclusion that the course has been very successful,               
              but problems remain.  Under this grant, the principal investigators            
              will undertake new strategies and tasks to improve efficiency;                 
              improve individual learning and small group dynamics; upgrade                  
              laboratory offerings; and disseminate their teaching methods and               
              materials.  This award will enable them to enhance their course                
              offering in order to make it maximally effective for their students            
              and to make their methods available to other college biology                   
              teachers.
