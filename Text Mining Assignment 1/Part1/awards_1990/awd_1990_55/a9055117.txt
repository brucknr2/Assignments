Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Interdisciplinary Science Center of Hampton University will                
              initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars (EAI) project                
              in math and physics for 24 minority students entering grade 7.                 
                                                                                             
              Participants will have an opportunity for math/physics enrichment              
              working with Hampton University physics and mathematics                        
              professors as well as with scientists from a Department of Energy              
              site, the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF).
