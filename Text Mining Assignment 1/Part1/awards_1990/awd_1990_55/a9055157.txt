Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Clemson University will initiate a 4-week, residential Young Scholars          
              project in Manufacturing Engineering for 30 students entering grade 12.        
                                                                                             
              The project will introduce young scientists and engineers to the               
              manufacturing process.  Topics include Statistics and Quality Control,         
              CAD, CAM Robotics, Physical Modeling, Rapid Prototyping and System             
              Simulation.  Lectures, laboratories and industry trips will introduce          
              the students to these manufacturing methodologies using "hands-on"             
              techniques and will emphasize the importance of basic scientific,              
              mathematical and engineering principles in the development and operation       
              of manufacturing systems.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Project assignments will involve creating prototype videotapes of their        
              project work and final presentations.  These tapes will be part of a           
              follow-up program allowing participants to present their manufacturing         
              expertise to their school classes.
