Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Colorado at Denver will initiate a five-week, commuter       
              Young Scholars project in Chemistry for 10 students entering grades            
              9,10.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The Young Scholars will be matched in teams with undergraduate science         
              majors and research mentors.  The students will work on research-style         
              projects in chemistry under the direction of the CU-Denver chemistry           
              faculty.  They will take field trips to visit local industry and               
              governmental laboratories and governmental science advisory panel              
              meetings.  Outside speakers will be invited to engage in discussion            
              sessions with the students concerning research projects they are               
              involved in, careers in chemistry-related fields, pursuing a career in         
              science, and the philosophy and ethics of research.                            
                                                                                             
              The students will present a traveling science exhibition of their              
              projects at their schools in the Fall.  The project director,                  
              accompanied by one or two of the undergraduate students, will provide          
              chemistry demonstrations for the highs schools throughout the Fall.
