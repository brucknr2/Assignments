              The Foundation for Glacier and Environmental Research will initiate an         
              eight-week, residential Young Scholars project in Environmental Earth          
              Science for 10 students entering grade 12.                                     
                                                                                             
              Working on Alaska's Juneau Icefield, North America's fifth largest             
              icefield, students will be in the field for the entire period in a             
              seven-day-a-week immersion in on-going and new research projects.              
                                                                                             
              Involvement will continue throughout the academic year via preparation
