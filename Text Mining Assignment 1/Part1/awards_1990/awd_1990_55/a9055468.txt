Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Computer Visualizations for Teaching Mathematics project                   
              is a three-year effort initiated by the California State                       
              University at Northridge to help secondary school teachers                     
              incorporate a visual emphasis in the teaching of pre-algebra                   
              through precalculus. The project will serve teachers from the                  
              Los Angeles area. Two cadres of 40 teachers will participate                   
              in a two-year project, with overlap in the second summer and                   
              the second and third academic years. Teachers will be involved                 
              in a three-week summer institute and a series of academic year                 
              followup activities, including monthly meetings and a winter                   
              institute; a week-long followup is included in the second                      
              summer. The project will introduce teachers to three different                 
              experimental programs ( the Alhambra High School IBM Network                   
              for Mathematics and Science Project, the W.M. Keck Curriculum                  
              Project, and the Ohio State Enhancing Mathematics Through                      
              Technology program.) Participants' administrators will attend                  
              a portion of the program. Schools will contribute released                     
              time and calculators for their participants. Other cost                        
              sharing is provided by the University, the Los Angeles Unified                 
              School District, the Keck Foundation, IBM, and Texas                           
              Instruments.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is provided as approximately 40% of the NSF                       
              award.
