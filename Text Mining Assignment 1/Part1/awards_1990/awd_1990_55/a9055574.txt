Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a new model of             
              instruction and assessment that fosters the construction of scientific         
              meaning in students and that encourages conceptual development                 
              consistent with the growth of scientific knowledge.  We propose the            
              development of a Portfolio Culture in science classrooms.  the                 
              implementation of a portfolio culture represents a fundamental change in       
              teaching priorities, classroom practices, and institutional functions.         
              This project is directed at evaluating and documenting how the adoption        
              of a portfolio culture affects student performance as well as how              
              teacher attitudes and practice are affected.  This research will have          
              several outcomes:  setting classroom instructional guidelines that             
              inform teachers about the selection and sequences of instructional             
              tasks; generating strategies to conduct formative assessment of                
              students' knowledge bases; providing recommendations for in-service            
              education programs that strive to implement conceptual change teaching         
              reforms; and exploring ways that alternative assessment strategies can         
              be used by other educational constituents to communicate learning              
              outcomes.  Educational Testing Service is contributing substantial             
              financial and staff resources to support initial phases of this work.          
              Pittsburgh Public Schools is willing to contribute costs associated with       
              participation by teachers and administrators.
