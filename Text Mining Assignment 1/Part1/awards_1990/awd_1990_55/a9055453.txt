Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of California, San Francisco Science Institute                  
              for Elementary Teachers (UCSF City Science Project) is an                      
              integral component of the San Francisco Unified School                         
              District's comprehensive plan for K-5 Science Program                          
              Improvement.  The Project will be responsible for the                          
              inservice education of 100 teachers over four years.  Through                  
              three years of month long education sessions, where the                        
              content of elementary science will be presented through                        
              sessions modeling excellent hands-on science teaching, these                   
              teachers will become the UCSF Science Partners.  Working in                    
              conjunction with an experienced leader in their school, these                  
              newly trained teachers will be responsible for making                          
              significant changes in their school's science program.  The                    
              100 UCSF Science Partners will exhibit leadership by                           
              supporting their fellow classroom teachers as they initiate                    
              the city's new hands-on curriculum.  In partnership with K-5                   
              Science Support Teachers and the City's Science Specialists,                   
              the UCSF Science Partners will be released to provide                          
              presentations, demonstrations and/or team-teaching with                        
              colleagues during the Site-Institute at their own school.  In                  
              addition, the 100 UCSF Science Partners will be teamed by                      
              grade levels to provide workshops on specific grade level                      
              Model Science Units to teachers throughout the system.                         
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing for the project will be 47%.
