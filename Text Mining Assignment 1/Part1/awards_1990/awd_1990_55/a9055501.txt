              This three year project, the Rice University School                            
              Mathematics Project, continues the work initiated through a                    
              previous Teacher Enhancement award.  The program will have

              year activity. Participants from the Houston Independent                       
              School District will attend in three-person teams (two                         
              teachers, one administrator) from their schools. Each summer,                  
              a new group of 48 teachers will be involved, 16 at each level.                 
              Teachers will study mathematics content and pedagogy, with                     
              emphasis on patterns and functions, geometric ideas, modeling,                 
              statistics, and algebra.A school-based coordinator will assist                 
              teachers with academic-year inservice and implementation                       
              activities.
