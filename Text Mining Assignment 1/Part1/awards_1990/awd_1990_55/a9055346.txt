Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is a collaborative effort between the Oregon                     
              Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) and the Oregon Science                   
              Teachers Association (OSTA) designed to enhance K-8 science                    
              through two major initiatives: 1) a ten month teacher-in-                      
              residence (TIR) program at the Museum that will utilize a                      
              sabbatical-leave staff development design (4 teachers/year                     
              for a total of 12 over three years), and 2) a two-week (60-                    
              80 hours) Summer Institute for K-8 Oregon teachers (30/year                    
              for a total of 90 over three years) conducted by project                       
              staff and TIRs; the Institute program will incorporate TIRs'                   
              experiences of the past year at the Museum and will utilize                    
              Museum facilities and professional support.  As part of the                    
              their sabbatical application to participate in the Teacher-                    
              in-Residence plan, prospective TIRs will be expected to                        
              develop with their administrators a dissemination plan for                     
              their home school districts.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because it (1) is designed to enhance the science                      
              knowledge and teaching of leader teachers through a year-                      
              long emersion in the informal science environment of a                         
              museum as well as through academic courses in science                          
              content and methodology; (2) contains an amplification plan                    
              which will involve the TIRs both in a summer institute for                     
              30 teachers from throughout the state, and in ongoing                          
              support within their districts throughout the year; and (3)                    
              serves as a model for an alternative and innovative means to                   
              teacher enhancement in K-8 science education.                                  
                                                                                             
              The non-NSF cost sharing amount is approximately 26% of the                    
              amount requested from NSF.
