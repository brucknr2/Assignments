              The University of Minnesota @ Minneapolis/St. Paul will initiate               
              a three-week, commuter Young Scholars (EAI) project in                         
              Mathematics for 25 students entering grades 7,8.                               
                                                                                             
              The summer institute will emphasize innovative content and                     
              instruction, problem-oriented learning, exploration with graphing              
              calculators/computers, and math team competitions.
