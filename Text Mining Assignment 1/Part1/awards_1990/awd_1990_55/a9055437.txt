Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will train fifty sixth grade science teachers                     
              to emphasize physical science investigations in their                          
              curriculum.  The teachers will participate in a three-year                     
              program to improve their knowledge of physical science and                     
              their ability to teach this subject through inquiry.  Two                      
              groups, consisting of 25 participants each, will be                            
              involved in a summer session where they will take part in                      
              laboratory activities, demonstrations, science and societal                    
              issue analysis, the study of technological applications,                       
              field experiences, seminars, and the review of                                 
              instructional programs.  The teachers will then implements                     
              such activities, analyze their teaching, and gather                            
              attitudinal and achievement data pertaining to their                           
              students.  The evaluation of the project will be based upon                    
              the extent to which it helps sixth-grade science teacher                       
              implement inquiry-oriented science programs.                                   
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing for the project will be thirty-seven                          
              percent of the NSF portion.
