Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal provides a plan for enhancing the scientific                     
              skills of middle school and secondary school teachers by                       
              combining field research experiences for teachers with a                       
              collaborative, professionally-guided approach to the                           
              development, evaluation, and assessment of curriculum based on                 
              the teachers' own research experience.  Eighty teachers will                   
              participate in project activities.  The curriculum will stress                 
              scientific process skills, participatory learning, classroom                   
              research activities, and an interdisciplinary approach to                      
              scientific issues.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 27% of the NSF award.
