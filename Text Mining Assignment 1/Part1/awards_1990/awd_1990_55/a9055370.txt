Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year project sponsored by the George Washington University            
              is designed to enhance the content knowledge and teaching skills of            
              middle school science educators, to create a model for the innovative          
              use of computer aided, hypermedia technology in the science                    
              classrooms and to encourage increased collaboration between education          
              and scientists.  The first year will focus on life sciences and the            
              second year will focus on the physical sciences both as appropriate            
              for the middle school curriculum.  Each year fourteen teams from               
              schools in the greater Washington, D.C. area will participate in a             
              four week summer workshop with school year follow up sessions and              
              site visits.  The summer workshops consist of content enhancement,             
              skill building in the use of computer aided hypermedia and skill and           
              content utilization through the development of classroom lessons and           
              leadership skills development.  The school year follow up includes             
              team meetings, implementation of science lessons, site visits,                 
              Saturday sessions, inservice workshops lead by participants and                
              participation in a regional science educators conference.
