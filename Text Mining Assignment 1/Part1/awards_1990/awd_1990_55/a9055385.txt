Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is an 18 month program that includes 1) a 1991                    
              summer institute for 32 high school biology teachers with two                  
              academic year follow-up sessions, and 2) a pilot leadership                    
              program consisting of five two-week workshops taught, during                   
              the summer of 1992, by teams of lead teachers selected from                    
              previous institutes. The institute and follow-up sessions will                 
              be held on the campus of Indiana University and the workshops                  
              will be held in five different local sites, yet to be                          
              selected.  The workshops will serve an additional 100                          
              teachers.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this program, which builds upon the success of                  
              a previous teacher enhancement effort, is to develop a                         
              leadership program that can serve as a national model for                      
              dissemination of knowledge and pedagogical techniques in a                     
              specific subject matter area. The objectives of this program                   
              are 1) to improve the quality of instruction of the nature of                  
              science and evolution; 2) to encourage and enable biology                      
              teachers to begin with these matters and to integrate them                     
              throughout the biology course; 3) to demonstrate how the use                   
              of humans as biological examples can enhance student interest                  
              and learning; 4) to assist teachers in developing a more                       
              dynamic teaching methodology.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Applications sessions will emphasize a shift in laboratory                     
              focus toward exploratory activities.  In addition the use of                   
              cooperative learning, concept mapping, and textbooks as                        
              reference sources will be encouraged.                                          
                                                                                             
              An amount equal to 28% of NSF costs will be provided as cost                   
              sharing.
