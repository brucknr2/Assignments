Abstract    :
              The this project seeks to improve the appeal and                               
              approachability of science to college students by preparing                    
              materials to be used with science fiction films to teach                       
              science and its relationships to technology and society.  Among                
              the principal outcomes will be a student textbook, Learning                    
              Science Through Science Fiction Films, suitable for use as the                 
              primary or secondary textbook for an introductory level                        
              physics, physical science, biology or technology course for                    
              non-science majors, and including an accompanying instructor's                 
              manual.  Both volumes will be published by the American                        
              Institute of Physics.  Prior NSF support has demonstrated that                 
              using science fiction films to teach science has a very                        
              positive effect on students' attitudes towards science,                        
              knowledge of science as a discovery process, and cognitive                     
              development.  The project materials will be tested with classes                
              of college students, and faculty will be trained to use the                    
              materials.The institutional support for this project exceeds                   
              the award.
