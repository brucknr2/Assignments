                  NACME proposes to develop a 20 minute videotape, with a                   
              teacher's guide and student brochure, that will use career                     
              opportunities in engineering as a vehicle to encourage math and                
              science course-taking among minority high school students.  By                 
              introducing engineering careers as dynamic, exciting                           
              professions that offer excellent prospects for minority                        
              graduates, NACME hopes to motivate students to take academic                   
              track science and math courses beginning at the 8th/9th grade                  
              crossroads and continuing through high school graduation.

              to 14 year-old minority students (5th through 8th graders) and                 
              a secondary audience of non-minority students, parents,                        
              teachers and guidance counselors, will focus on the lives of                   
              successful young engineers, male and female, from diverse                      
              ethnic backgrounds.
