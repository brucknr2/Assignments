Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In spring of 1992, Scripps Institution of Oceanography will open a new         
              Aquarium-Museum.  The enlarges facility will include a 3700 sq. ft.            
              gallery, the Scripps Hall of Oceanography.  Funding is requested for a         
              new exhibit in this gallery, Exploring the Blue Planet, which will offer       
              visitors an overview of the ocean sciences -- to our knowledge, the only       
              major exhibit on oceanography in the United States.  The exhibit first         
              introduces visitors to our water planet, followed by a walk through the        
              history of oceanographic research.  Visitors are then invited to explore       
              the ocean world as if they were oceanographers themselves, making              
              discoveries as they follow the theme of "water" through the hall, adding       
              components one-by-one to build a global system: first water alone (water       
              chemistry and movements), then adding air (climate and weather), next          
              adding land (seafloor spreading and plate tectonics), and finally adding       
              life (adaptations of organisms to the marine environment).  Through            
              interactive exhibits on scientific concepts, coupled with exhibits on          
              related Scripps research projects, visitors gain an appreciation for the       
              process of science and its application to their everyday lives.  The           
              conclusion of Exploring the Blue Planet brings together the four realms        
              of water, air, land and life to emphasize the nature of Earth as an            
              interrelated global system.  Visitors learn that oceanography, an              
              interdisciplinary science that is global in scale and often                    
              international in practice, lends itself to a balanced and comprehensive        
              investigation of global change and our future on earth.
