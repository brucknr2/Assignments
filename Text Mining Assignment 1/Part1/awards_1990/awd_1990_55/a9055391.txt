Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Bank Street College of Education will implement a                          
              mathematics leadership project centering around a team of ten                  
              teachers from ten predominantly minority New York City                         
              elementary and middle schools. The leaders will participate in                 
              a three-summer program, and will serve as half-time                            
              mathematics specialists in their schools during the academic                   
              year. The goal of the project is to change the way mathematics                 
              is taught in these schools. Seventy teachers in the faculties                  
              of the schools will also participate in project activities                     
              organized at Bank Street, as well as in inservice activities                   
              led by the leaders at the school level, over the three year                    
              period of the project. Parent workshops are included, and a                    
              manual for inservice leaders will be developed and                             
              disseminated. Mathematical emphases for the leaders will be in                 
              the areas of: foundations of arithmetic, functions, geometry,                  
              and algebraic structures. Summer coursework will lead to a                     
              masters degree in education for the ten leader teachers.                       
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is provided by schools and Bank Street as 219% of                 
              the NSF request.
