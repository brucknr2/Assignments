Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will strengthen and extend support of science                     
              education by offering a series of Summer Institutes in                         
              Astronomy for science teachers at secondary and elementary                     
              levels.  This Institute will take place at the University of                   
              Toledo (UT), and will use facilities of the Ritter                             
              Observatory and Ritter Planetarium on the University of                        
              Toledo Campus.  The workshops/institutes will take place                       
              during the summers of 1991, 1992 and 1993, and will last for                   
              three weeks (the first workshop is scheduled for July 22-                      
              August 9, 1991).  Twenty-five teachers will be selected for                    
              each workshop.  The teachers will be selected on the basis of                  
              their backgrounds and recommendations by their department                      
              head or principal.  These teachers will be "leaders" who will                  
              learn from the UT experience and in turn lead astronomy                        
              workshops at local and regional levels for other teachers                      
              interested in using astronomy in their courses.                                
                                                                                             
              The University of Toledo workshop programs will be modeled on                  
              the very successful Support Program for Instructional                          
              Competency in Astronomy (SPICA) conducted by the Center for                    
              astrophysics at Harvard University.  It is a prime goal of                     
              the UT-SPICA program to use materials and instructional                        
              techniques developed by the original (Science Teaching                         
              through its Astronomical Roots) STAR-SPICA programs and                        
              disseminate them to the teaching community.                                    
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 34% of the NSF award.
