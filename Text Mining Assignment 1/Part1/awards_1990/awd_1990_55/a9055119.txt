Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of California, Berkeley, will renew a six-week,                 
              commuter Young Scholars (EAI) project in Engineering as applied                
              to Mathematics and Physics for 120 students entering grades 7-9.               
                                                                                             
              Students will be introduced to math, science and engineering                   
              concepts in ways that will demonstrate to them how academic                    
              coursework relates to the world around them, and how the practice              
              of science in accomplished.  The summer program includes morning               
              mathematics and English courses, seminars in culture and ethics,               
              afternoon pre-engineering projects, and a "shadowing" program                  
              whereby students will meet with mentor scientists and engineers.               
                                                                                             
              The academic-year program will include follow-up activities for                
              students in schools through MESA (Mathematics, Engineering,                    
              Science Achievement) programs as well as a Saturday Academy at                 
              UC-Berkeley.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The program will also involve parents by helping them become                   
              informed and actively involved in the education of their                       
              children.
