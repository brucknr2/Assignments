Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Department of Oral Biology of the State University of New York at          
              Buffalo will initiate an eight-week, commuter Young Scholars project in        
              the Biological/Biophysical Sciences for 12 students entering grade 12.         
                                                                                             
              Each student, with two students per laboratory, will be provided a             
              "hands-on" research experience with one of six established investigators       
              working in the areas of bone cell physiology, bacterial molecular              
              genetics, structure/function relationships of macromolecules, cellular         
              and humoral immunology, bacterial physiology, or immunochemistry of            
              proteins.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              A seminar series will also be arranged for the students to present their       
              work to their peers and mentors and a poster preparation/ presentation         
              of data will be a component of the project.
