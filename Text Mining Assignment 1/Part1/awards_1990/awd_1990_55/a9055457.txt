Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a four year program that will provide a one                    
              week seminar each summer at the Bronx Zoo for secondary                        
              science teachers. The purpose of the program is to stimulate                   
              teachers' creativity, improve their instructional skills and                   
              to give them proficiency in the use of wildlife exhibits to                    
              motivate students to study science. The seminars will be                       
              based on the Bronx Zoo's award winning curriculum, Survival                    
              Strategies. Developed with NSF funds, Survival Strategies                      
              has been recognized as an effective program by the U.S.                        
              Department of Education; the New York State Department of                      
              Education; and the Johns Hopkins University Center for                         
              Research on Effective Schooling for Disadvantaged Students.                    
                                                                                             
              Each summer, beginning in 1992, an intensive 5 day seminar                     
              will accommodate 35 science teachers of grades 7-11,                           
              selected from secondary schools throughout the United                          
              States. Following completion of the seminar, each                              
              participant teacher will offer in-service training for other                   
              science teachers from their local area.
