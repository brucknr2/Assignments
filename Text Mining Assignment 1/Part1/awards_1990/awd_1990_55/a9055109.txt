Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Oregon State University will initiate a three-week,                        
              residential Young Scholars (EAI) project in Physics and                        
              Mathematics for 30 students entering grades 7,8.                               
                                                                                             
              Participants chosen will be members of the existing OSU SMILE                  
              Program that offers academic year math/science/computer                        
              enrichment activities for minority middle-schoolers in                         
              disadvantaged rural Oregon communities in cooperation with local               
              school districts.  Physics activities will focus on acoustics and              
              optics, emphasizing hands-on laboratory participation.                         
              Mathematics activities are designed to complement the physics                  
              activities and also emphasize hands-on discovery learning.
