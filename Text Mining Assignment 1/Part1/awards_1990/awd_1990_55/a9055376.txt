Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of New Hampshire seeks funds for the                            
              three-year program to impact the direction of the teaching                     
              and learning of mathematics in the rural regions of the                        
              Northeastern United States.  Teams of a middle and a high                      
              school teacher of mathematics and a school supervisor or                       
              administrator from each of 12 rural schools or school                          
              districts in the Northeast will participate in the                             
              project.  The teachers will attend two summer institutes:                      
              the first a four-week institute whose focus will be the                        
              teaching and learning of algebra and of statistics, and                        
              the second a three-week institute on assessment.  The                          
              teachers and their supervisor/administrator will then                          
              attend a two-week institute the  third summer which will                       
              focus on leadership development, the change process in                         
              the schools, and conducting inservice workshops.  School                       
              year follow-up activities will include a yearly fall                           
              meeting at NCTM's Northeast Regional Conference and a                          
              yearly spring session at the University of New Hampshire                       
              as well as school visitations by the staff.                                    
                                                                                             
              In addition to the 36 first wave teachers and                                  
              administrators, it is anticipated that an additional 360                       
              second-wave middle and high school teachers and                                
              administrators will be enhanced.  The University of New                        
              Hampshire's cost-sharing will account for 7% of the NSF                        
              budget.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Enhancing the teaching and learning of middle and high                         
              school mathematics in rural pockets of the United States                       
              must be a vital component of improving mathematics                             
              education for the 21st Century.  This project can serve                        
              as a model for such enhancement.
