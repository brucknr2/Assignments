Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, sponsored by the Commonwealth Partnership, a                     
              partnership of twelve liberal arts colleges and universities                   
              in Pennsylvania, is a three year Biology initiative,                           
              starting April 1, 1991.  The purpose of the initiative is to                   
              enhance student interest and achievement in science by                         
              promoting the professional development of secondary biology                    
              teachers through school/college collaboration.  The                            
              initiative will (1) update teachers' knowledge of recent                       
              advances in biology; (2) engage teachers in laboratory                         
              investigations/research techniques; (3) help teachers                          
              improve instructional effectiveness; (4) foster collegial                      
              relationships biologists at secondary and college levels:                      
              (5) develop participants abilities to be professional                          
              leaders; and (6) support ongoing professional development                      
              programs.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              In the summer of 1991, 120 outstanding secondary biology                       
              teachers from Pennsylvania and surrounding states (DE, MD,                     
              NJ, OH, and WV) will attend 3-week residential institutes at                   
              five host campuses.  Laboratory and classroom sessions will                    
              update and deepen participants' knowledge in cell and                          
              molecular biology.  Applications sessions will focus on                        
              applying new materials and approaches in the classroom and                     
              on means of extending selected institute outcomes to over                      
              3600 colleagues.  Over the next two years, outreach                            
              activities and professional development programs will                          
              support classroom implementation and staff development                         
              activities at the local level.                                                 
                                                                                             
              During the third year of the initiative, teams of                              
              participant master teachers will conduct seven extended                        
              workshops (nine days) for 140 secondary biology teachers, so                   
              as to provide an in-depth transfer of knowledge and                            
              experience gained through the program.                                         
                                                                                             
              An amount equal to 208% of NSF costs has been provided as                      
              cost sharing.
