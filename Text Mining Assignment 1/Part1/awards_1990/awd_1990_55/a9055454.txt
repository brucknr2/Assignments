Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson National                         
              Fellowship Foundation, is an 18 month project to provide                       
              information and resources to 50 carefully selected,                            
              outstanding high school biology teachers from all regions of                   
              the country.  The subject content of the program is the                        
              study of the relationship of the human species to its global                   
              environment.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The program begins with a four week summer institute held at                   
              Princeton University during the summer of 1991, staffed by a                   
              faculty of college and university scientists enlisted                          
              nationwide. Institute activities include presentation -                        
              discussion sessions, computer and computer modeling                            
              activities, as well as experiments and demonstrations that                     
              can be used in the high school classroom.  These activities                    
              culminate in the development of units that can be used to                      
              integrate the information into high school biology                             
              curricula.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              During the following academic year, the participants                           
              implement these activities in their own classrooms and                         
              conduct in-service and outreach sessions on these activities                   
              in their local areas. Teams of the very best participants                      
              conduct one-week workshops at sites throughout the country                     
              in succeeding summers, thus reaching less well-prepared                        
              teachers, who are the ultimate target of the program.                          
                                                                                             
              The National Science Foundation is a participant in a much                     
              larger program of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, so that NSF                   
              funds are being matched at a 6.75:1 ratio.
