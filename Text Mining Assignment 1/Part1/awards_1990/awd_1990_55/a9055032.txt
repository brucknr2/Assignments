Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Maine will initiate a three-week, residential                
              Young Scholars project in Engineering for 24 students entering                 
              grades 11,12.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The project aims to stimulate interest in engineering careers                  
              among the participants, with particular emphasis on young women.               
              This will be achieved through engineering research projects,                   
              tours to industrial sites, an overview of career opportunities                 
              in five engineering disciplines and a mini-course in Logic                     
              Systems.                                                                       
              Students and teachers at each participant's school will also                   
              become aware of engineering through a follow-up project.
