Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Texas Medical Branch will continue an eight-week,            
              commuter and residential Young Scholars project in biochemistry and life       
              science for 16 students entering grades 11,12.                                 
                                                                                             
              Each student will be placed for eight weeks in an ongoing research             
              project.  Under the guidance of a faculty preceptor, the student will          
              learn a set of skills or techniques in order to contribute to the              
              research effort.
