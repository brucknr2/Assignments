Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences plans to conduct a 5                   
              year project to train 150 mentor teachers (30 teachers/year)                   
              and their principals, who will then train the remaining 1100                   
              elementary teachers in the Buffalo Public School System.                       
              The training would include two 5-week summer sessions  (in a                   
              Magnet school that is physically incorporated into the                         
              Buffalo Museum of Science) and 4 in-service workshops during                   
              the academic years following each of the summer workshops.                     
              This innovative leadership project is a collaborative effort                   
              between the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences (including                     
              both education and curatorial/science staff persons) the                       
              Buffalo Public Schools, and individuals from local colleges                    
              and universities.  The setting of the project is enhanced by                   
              a Science and Math Magnet School which is housed within the                    
              museum, and by the school/museum's location in a largely                       
              inner city environment with easy accessibility to minority                     
              persons.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The project is designed to provide mentor teachers with a                      
              strong science background in pedagogy and content over a                       
              two-year period of summer and academic-year workshops, and                     
              to prepare and support these mentors as they inservice their                   
              colleagues.  Project staff from the museum, public schools,                    
              and the academic community will provide strong support                         
              through academic-year workshops, site visits and                               
              telecommunications networking.  Principals will be                             
              appropriately involved, and will work with mentors to                          
              develop a science inservice program tailored to meet the                       
              needs of their individual schools; as a consequence,                           
              virtually all of the 1100 K-6 classroom teachers of science                    
              in the Buffalo Public Schools will have been prepared to                       
              teach investigative, hands-on science to their students.                       
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost sharing is approximately 27.9% of the amount                      
              requested from NSF.
