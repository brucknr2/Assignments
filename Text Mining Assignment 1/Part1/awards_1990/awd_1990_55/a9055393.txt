Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Project SMART (Science and Mathematics for Arizona's Rural                     
              Teachers) is a three year project sponsored by the Mammoth - San               
              Manuel School District No.8 in San Manuel Arizona.  It is                      
              designed to improve both the mathematics and science instruction               
              practiced in grades K-8.  Staff development and curriculum                     
              implementation workshops and institutes are planned for two                    
              groups of teachers.  The first group, the Math and Science                     
              leadership team, will consist of 25 master teachers who will                   
              participate in leadership institutes each summer for three years.              
              This group will acquire the background, skills and expertise                   
              necessary to become part of a facilitator team for teacher                     
              workshops.  The second group, classroom teachers, will attend                  
              workshops of their choice designed to address content, teaching                
              strategies and effective curriculum needs of teachers.  A series               
              of workshops will be developed and offered at different sites in               
              the district.  Instructional  support programs consist of                      
              workshops for administration, parents and paraprofessionals.                   
              Partnership activities with school districts, county offices,                  
              community colleges, universities, state-level educations and                   
              private funding agencies will be carried out to generate support               
              for mathematics and science improvement efforts during and after               
              the NSF project.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The NSF funds for this project are being matched by the SMART                  
              consortia institutions by an amount equivalent to 71% of the                   
              grant.
