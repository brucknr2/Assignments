Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The American Chemical Society (ACS) requests funds to support a                
              two-year Young Scholars program involving twenty-five secondary                
              school students each year at the following institutions, chosen                
              for their accessibility to high-ability, minority students:                    
              Drury College, Northern Arizona University, Montana College of                 
              Mineral Science and Technology, the University of Texas at El                  
              Paso, and Florida International University.  Five students will                
              attend the program at each university each summer; therefore a                 
              total of fifty students will be involved over the two-year                     
              period.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The program will consist of an eight-week summer chemical                      
              research experience for the students, providing a comprehensive                
              experience in scientific research that also includes instruction               
              in scientific methods and an exploration of scientific ethics.                 
              Research chemists will serve as role models for the students,                  
              encouraging them to pursue careers in chemistry or related                     
              sciences.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Follow-up programs will involve students and preceptors traveling              
              to an ACS Regional Meeting or the annual meeting of the Society                
              for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science                
              and presenting their work during a poster session, as well as                  
              monthly meetings of the students and preceptors, either on                     
              Saturdays or after school.
