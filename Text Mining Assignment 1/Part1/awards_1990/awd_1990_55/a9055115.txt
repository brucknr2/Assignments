Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Northern Arizona University will initiate a five-week, residential,            
              multidisciplinary Young Scholars project in Biology, Chemistry,                
              Forestry, Geology, and Physics/Astronomy for 30 high school students           
              entering grades 10,11.                                                         
                                                                                             
              "SOS: Summer of Science" provides rising high school sophomores and            
              juniors with the opportunity to perform research in Astronomy, Biology,        
              Chemistry, Forestry, or Geology at Northern Arizona University.                
              Research internships offer each student a discipline-specific research         
              experience with a practicing scientist.  Research activities are               
              complemented by training in basic skills needed for actual research -          
              experimental design, statistics, using library collections, reading            
              scientific literature, scientific writing, and social and historical           
              contexts.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Students will present the results of their research to their parents,          
              teachers from throughout the region, and university faculty during a           
              Scientific Conference that is designed to prepare them to continue the         
              research with the students in their high schools.
