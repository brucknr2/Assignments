Abstract    :
              About twenty investigative lessons are being developed for display             
              on a Videoshow unit from General Parametrics Corporation, which                
              will help build a model curriculum for lower division, introductory            
              biology courses.  Emphasis for the lecture packages will be placed             
              on visually clear examples of experimental sequences, flow charts,             
              and data that add dimension to a student's understanding of                    
              scientific processes.  Analytical skills will be enhanced by                   
              numerous examples of experimental data presented first in raw form             
              then displayed in a graphic or statistical manner that changes                 
              numbers into information.  The strong visual support for these                 
              difficult concepts will help an under represented general student              
              population understand scientific methodology.  Unique features of              
              Videoshow that contribute to the overall quality of the lecture                
              products are its programmability, adaptability, ease of use, random            
              access features, and quality of images.  The addition of slide,                
              print, and transparency makers to the system will increase                     
              versatility. Changes in student achievement will be evaluated and              
              compared before and after implementation of the new program with               
              results being reported both locally and nationally.
