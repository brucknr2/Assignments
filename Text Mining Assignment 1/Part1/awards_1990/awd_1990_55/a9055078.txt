Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of South Alabama will initiate a four-week, residential         
              Young Scholars project in Archaeology for 15 students entering grades          
              11,12.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project will involve high school students in archaeological               
              research at the site of Old Mobile, the first long-term French colonial        
              settlement in the United States, dating from 1702 to 1711.  Students           
              will work closely with the professional team of archaeologists during          
              excavation and laboratory analysis, and will devise individual research        
              projects.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Participants will pursue these projects throughout the academic year,          
              with support from the project staff, with the goal of presenting their         
              results at science fairs or state Academy of Sciences meetings.  One           
              focus of the project will be to explore career opportunities in                
              archaeology and related fields of science.
