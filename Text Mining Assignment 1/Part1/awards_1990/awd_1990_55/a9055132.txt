Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Minnesota, College of Biological Sciences, will              
              continue its eight-week, commuter Young Scholars project in the Life           
              Sciences for 20 students entering grade 12.                                    
                                                                                             
              Students will select a faculty mentor and pursue a research topic within       
              the problem area being investigated by that team.  This mini-project           
              forms the basis for an end-of-session report at a poster symposium.            
                                                                                             
              The poster will be taken back to the student's home school and will be         
              the basis for continued interaction between the student, the school, and       
              the College.  Participants will also attend weekly seminars and                
              discussion groups on scientific philosophy, methodology, ethics, and           
              careers.  Each student will be given individualized attention by college       
              advisors and by career exploration personnel.
