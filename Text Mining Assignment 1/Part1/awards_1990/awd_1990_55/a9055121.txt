              Zanesville (OUZ) will initiate a four-week, commuter Young                     
              Scholars project in Environmental Science for 20 students                      
              entering grades 9 and 10.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The project will focus on life sciences, engineering and                       
              technology, earth science, computer science, and math as they                  
              relate to environmental studies.                                               
                                                                                             
              Ecology provides the focus for this interdisciplinary hands-on                 
              experience.  Students will travel to state parks, a wildlife                   
              preserve, a fish hatchery, and EPA lab, a water treatment plant,               
              MATC's Natural Resources Center, and a variety of fully-equipped               
              labs at the sponsoring institutions.
