Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project seeks to take advantage of recent work on performance             
              assessment methods for precollege science and mathematics by applying          
              these advances to assessments of computer competence and related skills.       
              Performance assessment tasks in science and math will be examined for          
              their potential in assessing computer competence, computer literacy, and       
              other computer-related skills.  The proposed project will include a            
              meeting of specialists in performance assessments, especially in science       
              and mathematics, as well as specialists in educational computing.  The         
              outcomes of this meeting will be formulated into general recommendations       
              for the assessment community, as well as specific recommendations for          
              the IEA (International Association for the Evaluation of Educational           
              Achievement) Computers in Education Study meeting in October, 1990.
