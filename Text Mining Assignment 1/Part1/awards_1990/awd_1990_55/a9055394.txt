Abstract    :
              This conference, held in conjunction with the Association of                   
              Independent Technological Universities during the Spring of 1991,              
              is to determine the future needs in undergraduate engineering                  
              education within the framework of what is needed, feasible, and                
              available for immediate implementation.  Innovative                            
              modifications -- even major changes -- are critical for engineering            
              education, not only for the U.S. to be competitive in the global               
              sense but also to recapture U.S. industrial leadership.  The                   
              grantee provides funds for this project that are more an equal                 
              match for the NSF award.//
