Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ferrum College will initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars          
              project in Aquatic Ecology for 30 students entering grade 8.                   
                                                                                             
              The students will be involved in a research project on leaf                    
              decomposition in streams.  This aquatic ecology project will develop           
              knowledge and skills in biology, chemistry, statistics, and computer           
              use.  During the three-week session participants will also learn about         
              the discipline area, research work, and career path of active scientists       
              in aquatic ecology and other fields.
