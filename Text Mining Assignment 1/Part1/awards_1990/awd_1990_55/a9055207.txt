Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              For the fifth summer, Del Mar College will be hosting the Corpus Christi       
              Prefreshman Engineering Program (PREP).  This eight-week, commuter             
              program has been a Young Scholars site since the summer of 1989.  120          
              new students and 30 returnees will be admitted to the program.  These          
              students will be entering 8th and 9th graders who are interested in            
              studying Mathematics, Engineering and Computer Science.                        
                                                                                             
              Participants will attend classes/labs for four days a week and will have       
              field trips most Fridays to local industries and R&D centers.  A typical       
              class day begins with a scientist/engineer speaker for the purpose of          
              career orientation.  This hour is followed by an hour each in Logic,           
              Computer Science (Pascal), Engineering (with an emphasis on projects to        
              teach physical principles) and Problem Solving.
