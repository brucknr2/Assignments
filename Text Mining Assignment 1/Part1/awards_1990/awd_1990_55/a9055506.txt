Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a 40-month leadership teacher enhancement project                      
              which targets teachers from rural public and private schools                   
              near Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Two teachers (one K-3, one 4-6)                     
              from each of 35 schools will receive three years of training                   
              in content and methodology, and in strategies for leadership                   
              and inservicing.  Their respective principals will                             
              participate in planning science inservices, and the PI will                    
              provide support through 2 site visits/teacher/year and an                      
              800 hotline, as well as through program workshops.  At the                     
              end of three academic years, 595 teachers will have been                       
              involved in substantive inservicing supported by                               
              administration and principals, and by the PI.  Urban                           
              teachers from Fort Wayne, who have just completed a similar                    
              project, will serve as mentors to the rural teachers.                          
                                                                                             
              The 70 leader teachers will be involved in a three year                        
              program that includes summer workshops as well as monthly                      
              academic year inservices.  Urban teachers from Fort Wayne                      
              schools who participated in the P.I.'s previous grant                          
              project, will share their experiences with the participants                    
              of this project, establising partnership relationships                         
              between these urban and rural school teachers.  The leader                     
              teachers and their principals will plan inservice programs                     
              for teachers in their respective schools (595 teachers), and                   
              will be supported directly by the PI and project staff.  The                   
              project design plans for extensive direct involvement on the                   
              part of the P.I. and project staff, maximizing the project's                   
              potential for significant positive impact on science                           
              education in the targeted schools.                                             
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because it contains both a strong enhancement                          
              program and a carefully planned and well-supported                             
              leadership component that is designed to reach all of the                      
              classroom teachers in the schools of the leader teachers.                      
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is approximately 66% of the amount requested                      
              from NSF.
