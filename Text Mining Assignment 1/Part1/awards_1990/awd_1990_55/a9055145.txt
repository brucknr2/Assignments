Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              St. Cloud State University will initiate a five-week,                          
              multidisciplinary, residential Young Scholars project focusing on              
              water quality for 24 students entering grades 9,10.                            
                                                                                             
              Students will be exposed to these several disciplines through an               
              on-campus program and follow-up activities that use a "Science-                
              Technology-Society" (STS) approach and which focus on STS issues               
              of immediate relevance to the students and their respective                    
              communities.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The program will also include field trips, career awareness                    
              workshops, literature to parents on preparation for careers in                 
              science and engineering, seminars on the contributions of                      
              American Indian, Latin American, African, and Asian societies and              
              minority and female scientists to science and technology.                      
              Examination of the philosophical and ethical aspects of society-               
              science interface is an inherent and integral part of the STS                  
              model, and will be a part of the students' projects.
