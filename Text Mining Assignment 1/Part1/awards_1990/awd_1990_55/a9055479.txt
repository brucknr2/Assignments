Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Purdue University seeks funds for a three-year program to                      
              enhance middle and high school mathematics teachers in                         
              teaching mathematics as communication.  This will be                           
              accomplished through two-week workshops held in each of                        
              three consecutive summers as well as monthly meetings during                   
              the school year.  During the second summer, ten of the                         
              original participants will serve as teacher-leaders to help                    
              enhance 35 new participants.  During the third summer, 35                      
              teachers from the first two years will be invited back.                        
              There teachers will act as teacher-researchers, developing                     
              suitable teaching and learning methods which will be edited                    
              and disseminated by the Principal Investigator.  They will                     
              also prepare to serve as teachers-teaching-teachers,                           
              conducting approximately 35 half-day workshops for their                       
              colleagues.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Sixty-five middle and high school teachers will receive                        
              first-level enhancement, and 350 additional teachers should                    
              receive second-level enhancement through the half-day                          
              workshops.  In all, 415 teachers and administrators will be                    
              enhanced.  Purdue University's cost-sharing will account for                   
              15% of the NSF budget.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Mathematics as communication is one of the National Council                    
              of Teachers of Mathematics Standards which needs further                       
              research, development and implementation.  This project                        
              should help accomplish these goals.
