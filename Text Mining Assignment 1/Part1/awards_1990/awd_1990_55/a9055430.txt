Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal, titled "New Madrid Earthquake Project for                       
              Earth Science Teachers," is designed to improve earthquake                     
              education among earth science teachers from seven states                       
              along the New Madrid fault zone: Arkansas, Illinois,                           
              Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee.                       
              Sixty-three Middle/Junior High School, exemplary earth-                        
              science teachers will be selected: 28 the first year and 35                    
              the second, evenly representing the seven states.                              
                                                                                             
              The project includes a summer institute (2 weeks the first                     
              year, and 8 days the second) and follow-up activities each                     
              year.  The teachers will receive a variety of instructional                    
              strategies (e.g. lectures, field and laboratory work,                          
              computer simulation, etc.) and a video produced by the                         
              project to facilitate earthquake education for students,                       
              teachers, and the general public.  It is expected that each                    
              participant will conduct at least 3 awareness workshops                        
              averaging 20 teachers each; thereby almost 4,000 teachers                      
              will become familiar with the New Madrid Earthquake Project.                   
              The project provides a model for the study of other regional                   
              earth science topics.  The utilization of regional topics                      
              results in secondary science students understanding a                          
              greater relevance for science in general, and earth science                    
              in particular.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing by UMC is close to 52% of the amount                          
              requested from NSF.
