Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The LASE project is centered on an innovative "do-it-                          
              yourself" optics laboratory course based on the principles of                  
              manipulating and modulating laser beams, and designed to make                  
              physics more attractive to high school students by                             
              introducing them to every-day laser applications.                              
                                                                                             
              To facilitate implementation of these ideas, 2 two-week                        
              Summer workshops will be provided during 1991 to train forty                   
              high school physics teachers to teach the course, with in-                     
              service help, the following academic year.  The project                        
              concentrates on three strong pedagogical ideas developed                       
              during the first phase of the project:                                         
                   1.  providing each participant with an optical system                     
                       designed to be easily reproduced or modified in any                   
                       modestly equipped workshop, and incorporating many                    
                       "off-the-shelf" hardware-store items (A prototype                     
                       has already been competed),                                           
                   2.  providing a series of station-by-station                              
                       instructions beforehand for the participants as they                  
                       all work on the same activity at the same time.                       
                       This is the advantage of having a common optical                      
                       system,                                                               
                   3.  involving all participants as peer teachers during                    
                       the 1991-92 academic year in-service phase of the                     
                       program.  Groups of five teachers will take charge                    
                       of each of the monthly meetings scheduled for that                    
                       period.  Students will help them.                                     
                                                                                             
              Ten teachers from Phase 1 will provide instruction during the                  
              Summer workshops, along with faculty from San Jose State                       
              University.  Assistance will be provided by a full-time                        
              technician and SJSU physics majors.                                            
                                                                                             
              The forty participants will bring along at least one guest                     
              teacher to at least one in-service meeting during the year.                    
              This will be formally required.  By year's end close to                        
              seventy teachers will have been actively involved.                             
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 48% of the NSF award.
