Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Northern Iowa will initiate a three-week,                    
              commuter Young Scholars (EAI) project in Physics and Mathematics               
              for 24 students entering grades 7-9.                                           
                                                                                             
              The project, designed exclusively for ethnic minorities and                    
              women, will focus on basic physics and mathematics concepts                    
              including energy transfer, light, sound, graphs, symmetries and                
              probability.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Follow-up will include a series of bimonthly Saturday morning                  
              activities during the academic year.
