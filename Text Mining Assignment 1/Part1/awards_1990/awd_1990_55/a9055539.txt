Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  EINSTEIN is a series of three prime time television                       
              programs to be shown nationally on the Public Broadcasting                     
              Service (PBS).  The series will present a scientific biography                 
              of Albert Einstein.  The series will treat the life of Albert                  
              Einstein on several levels.  The central narative thread will                  
              trace the development and impact of Einstein's work in physics.                
              The three programs will examine Einstein's impact beyond                       
              physics -- as a muse for the arts; a dissident voice in                        
              politics; a moral sensibility; ultimately as the greatest                      
              public symbol of scientific accomplishment.  With original                     
              texts (including newly identified documents from the Einstein                  
              archives), historical footage, interviews, documentary                         
              sequences, the most sophisticated computer animation available,                
              and other techniques as appropriate, EINSTEIN will present to                  
              its audience a unique picture of the role of Albert Einstein in                
              the making of the modern world.  Beyond its broadcast in 1992,                 
              the series also will receive wide educational distribution in                  
              secondary schools and colleges and a large foreign audience.
