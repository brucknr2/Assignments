Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal offers a plan to enhance teacher content                         
              background and teaching strategy using an approach involving                   
              issues oriented science teaching and learning project.  There                  
              are four teacher enhancement units and four content                            
              enhancement units proposed for development and testing during                  
              the project.  The content enhancement units consist of topics                  
              such as, chemical reactions, toxicology for teachers, risk                     
              assessment and communication, and toxic waste.  In addition                    
              to the development and testing units, Leadership Enhancement                   
              Conferences will be held at the Lawrence Hall of Science                       
              during the summers of 1991, 1992, and 1993.                                    
                                                                                             
              Over a period of 31 months the project will provide 13 days                    
              of direct teacher development and leadership training to 70                    
              middle school teachers and one week of leadership training to                  
              35 instructional leaders associated with those teachers.                       
                                                                                             
              The goal of the project is to develop a system that can                        
              contribute to changing the way teachers teach science.  The                    
              project has the following objectives: (1) Develop, test,                       
              revise, produce, and disseminate a set of issue-oriented                       
              science teacher enhancement materials; (2) Establish, test,                    
              and revise a model that encourages leadership teams trained                    
              by the project to carry out substantive teacher enhancement                    
              activities related to the project's goals in their local                       
              districts; and (3) Help support and expand the impact of the                   
              project by attracting significant public and private sector                    
              funding.                                                                       
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 20% of the NSF award.//
