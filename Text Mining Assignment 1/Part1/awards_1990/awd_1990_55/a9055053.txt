Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Alfred University will initiate a two-week, residential Young Scholars         
              project in Engineering and Glass Science for 32 students entering grades       
              9-12.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              This project includes interaction with university scholars, learning           
              basic tenets such as methodology, philosophy of science and ethics, and        
              interaction with researchers and scientists at two corporate                   
              laboratories.  The students also will begin work on a research project         
              while in residence at the University.                                          
                                                                                             
              The project is designed to be continued at their local high school             
              during the academic year under the supervision of the Alfred faculty           
              assisted by high school science teachers.  The program will end with a         
              Science Conference on the Alfred University campus in the early spring         
              of 1992.
