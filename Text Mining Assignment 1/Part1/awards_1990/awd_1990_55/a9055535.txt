Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of Science City:  New York as a Science and                      
              Technology Exhibit, is to increase public awareness and                        
              interest in science and technology in daily life by creating                   
              "found exhibits" in public places throughout New York City.                    
              This proposal is based on a 1986 pilot project which developed                 
              criteria and concepts for successful Science City units and a                  
              prototype exhibit operating in a tourist elevator at the World                 
              Trade Center.                                                                  
                                                                                             
                   Science City will use the streets and structures of New                   
              York to present the science and technology of everyday life.                   
              It will reach the science inattentive public who do not go to                  
              science museums.  Eye-catching exhibits such as diffraction                    
              gratings mounted on bus shelters will reveal the different                     
              spectra of the incandescent, flourescent, neon, and mercury                    
              vapor lamps, already part of the street scene.                                 
                                                                                             
                   The New York Hall of Science will place Science City                      
              exhibits in public parks, subways, bus kiosks, and building                    
              lobbies.  Ten to fifteen different exhibits/signs, each                        
              replicated an average of 10 times, will be installed and                       
              evaluated throughout the boroughs of Queens and Manhattan.
