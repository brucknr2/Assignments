Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology will initiate a combined nine-         
              month (correspondence) and three-week (residential) Young Scholars             
              project in Mathematics for more than 350 (corresponding) and 30                
              (residing) students in grades 10-12.                                           
                                                                                             
              The USA Mathematical Talent Search (USAMTS) will provide a year-long,          
              nationwide, problem-solving competition among high school students which       
              encourages scientific endeavor as an on-going activity.  The Summer            
              Program will allow thirty of the strongest performers in the USAMTS            
              opportunities to improve their problem-solving skills, to explore              
              coherent, axiomatic bodies of mathematics, and to investigate                  
              mathematical, scientific and engineering disciplines as potential career       
              choices.
