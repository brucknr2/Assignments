              This is a program in which ocean science serves as a vehicle for               
              addressing all the sciences and aspects of engineering.  Students              
              will experience a 3-1/2 week residence on the CSU-LB campus

              Four Saturday follow-up sessions continue exploration of science               
              and engineering.
