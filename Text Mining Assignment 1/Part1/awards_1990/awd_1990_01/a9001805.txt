Abstract    :
                   This is a proposal to study mathematical models of physical               
              phenomena arising in the flow of compressible and turbulent                    
              gases.  In particular, the principal investigator will use                     
              analytical and numerical tools to investigate the instability of               
              solutions of nonlinear systems of hyperbolic equations in three                
              dimensions, the evolution of vortex filaments, the derivation of               
              macroscopic transport quantities from turbulent flows using                    
              techniques of homogenization theory, and the properties of weak                
              solutions of systems of equations from fluid dynamics and plasma               
              physics.                                                                       
                   Various types of physical phenomena involve flows containing              
              vortices.  Everyday examples of vortices are tornadoes or the                  
              bath water as it goes down the drain.  Mathematicians study the                
              properties of such vortex motions by constructing simplified sets              
              of equations that have "vortex-like" solutions and then using                  
              analytical and numerical methods to predict how these solutions                
              evolve in time.  The principal investigator will examine models                
              of vortex flows that arise in aerodynamics and plasma physics.
