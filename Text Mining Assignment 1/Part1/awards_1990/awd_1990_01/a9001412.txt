Abstract    :
              This project is in the area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry                
              and in the subfield of analytical fluorescence spectroscopy.                   
              Professor Warner will study interactions between cyclodextrans                 
              with a series of polyaromatic hydrocarbons using a suite of                    
              spectroscopic methods.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This research will use infrared spectroscopy, circular                         
              dichroism spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography and fluorescence                 
              spectroscopy to elucidate the molecule details of complexation                 
              between cyclodextrans and polyaromatic hydrocarbons together                   
              with the ternary effects arising from addition of alcohols.                    
              The results from this research will be useful in developing                    
              analytical measurements for naturally chiral compounds and for                 
              compounds with induced chirality.
