Abstract    :
                   Professor Iozzi will conduct research in the application of               
              ergodic theory to the study of group actions on manifolds or more              
              generally on measure spaces.  In particular she will apply                     
              techniques from this area, as well as methods of representation                
              theory and the theory of algebraic groups, to a variety of                     
              questions involving connected transformation groups and their                  
              discrete subgroups.  Examples of such questions are invariance                 
              phenomena for geometric structures and related issues on the                   
              compactification of algebraic varieties, orbit equivalence of                  
              actions, and the structural study of the diffeomorphism group of               
              a manifold.                                                                    
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics" can              
              be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                          
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
