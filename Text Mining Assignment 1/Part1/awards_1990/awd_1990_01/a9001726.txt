Abstract    :
                   This research provides surrogate statistical models for the               
              usually deterministic output of complex computer models which                  
              cannot be directly explored in great detail because of their size              
              and limitations on the number of runs. The models are based on a               
              set of runs at selected inputs to aid in predicting the output at              
              untried inputs, optimizing characteristics of the output,                      
              identifying important input factors and tuning the model to                    
              physical data. The strategies will be devised in the context of                
              large numbers of input factors. The ingredients will include                   
              methods to select inputs (statistical experimental design) and to              
              analyze the output data through the use of stochastic process                  
              models for deterministic outputs. Supercomputing power will be                 
              necessary to treat large numbers of factors and to extract the                 
              most out of an expensive-to-collect set of runs from computer                  
              models that themselves may run on supercomputers. A cross-                     
              disciplinary atmosphere will be maintained to stimulate the                    
              formulation of relevant problems with applicable solutions.
