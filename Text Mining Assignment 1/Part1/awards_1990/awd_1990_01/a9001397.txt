Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is the purpose of the proposed research to examine how the                  
              creation of burrows and reworking of the sediment by organisms                 
              effects the rate and degree of chemical reactions within these                 
              sediments.  In particular the P.I. will study the effects of                   
              these parameters on the chemical behavior of the elements                      
              manganese, nitrogen and carbon.  The eventual goals of the                     
              project are:  1) to create quantitative descriptions (using a                  
              mathematical model or models) of the types of transport and                    
              reaction distribution occurring during early diagenesis, and 2)                
              to understand better the implications of the transports and                    
              distributions on the geochemistry and ecology of the sediments.
