Abstract    :
                   The objective of the proposed study is to use molecular                   
              criteria to identify obligate or synergistic associations among                
              members of a natural anaerobic microbial biofilm community under               
              changing environmental conditions.  To achieve this objective,                 
              comparative sequencing of environmentally derived 16s ribosomal                
              RNAs and application of phylogenetically-based hybridization                   
              probes will be used to identify and monitor the dominant members               
              of groundwater biofilm communities that are established within                 
              laboratory bioreactor systems.  In conjunction with in situ                    
              hybridization techniques, this molecular framework will be used                
              to define interdependent relationships among community members                 
              such as those involving H2-producing bacteria (fermentative and                
              fatty acid-and alcohol-oxidizing bacteria) and H2-consuming                    
              bacteria (methanogenic bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria).                
              Bioreactor operating conditions (eg. Substrate concentration and               
              sulfate concentration) will be altered to detect these                         
              interdependent associations by following coordinate fluctuations               
              among selected microbial populations (using the molecular                      
              approach described above) during biofilm colonization,                         
              development and establishment of the climax community.  The                    
              proposed research should provide fundamental information                       
              regarding the diversity, stability and function of natural                     
              microbial communities.  Such basic information about microbial                 
              communities has thusfar been inaccessible, but constitutes the                 
              foundation for studies of microbial ecosystem perturbation and                 
              assessment of the risk associated with the release of                          
              genetically engineered microorganisms into the environment.
