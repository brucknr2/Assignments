Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will use his characterization of               
              the Kobayashi metric on smoothly bounded convex domains to study               
              the asymptotic behavior of this metric at a boundary.  The                     
              ultimate goal is to solidify the relationship between complex                  
              function theory on the domain and the geometry of the boundary.                
              In a second project he will study the global properties of                     
              contact structures on manifolds of dimension three.  Topological               
              invariants of the contact structure will be constructed                        
              analytically.                                                                  
                   Many of the most significant theorems in geometric analysis               
              relate geometric and topological invariants.  One of the earliest              
              of these was the relationship between the total Gaussian                       
              curvature of a smooth surface and its numbers of tubes and cross               
              caps.  In the present project, the principal investigator will                 
              relate global Riemannian contact structures to the base topology               
              of the manifold.
