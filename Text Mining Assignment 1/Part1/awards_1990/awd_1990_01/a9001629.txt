Abstract    :
                   This project will cover three basic interrelated areas of                 
              applied mathematics.  The first is concerned with large amplitude              
              motions both quasi periodic and almost periodic in dynamical                   
              systems of many degrees of freedom.  The principal investigator                
              will develop new methods of study, going beyond the KAM                        
              theory for small perturbations, that utilize a novel nonlinear                 
              p.d.e. approach.  The second related topic involves vortex                     
              dynamics of an ideal inviscid fluid.  Here the principal                       
              investigator will research the outstanding problems of                         
              leapfrogging of vortex rings, classes of vortex cores, and vortex              
              breakdown of bubble and spiral type.  Finally, the principal                   
              investigator will study of "flux phenomenon" in the new theories               
              of high Tc superconductivity, an area of prime importance in                   
              high technology.  All these areas require deep understanding of                
              nonlinear science and its associated mathematical structures.                  
              This has been the central focus of the investigator's research                 
              for over two decades.
