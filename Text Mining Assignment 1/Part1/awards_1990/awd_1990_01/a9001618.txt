Abstract    :
              This project adds insight, design techniques, and analysis tools to the        
              area of massively parallel VLSI computation for special-purpose search         
              processor.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Analyses for the speedups offered by associative memories are carried          
              through appropriate modeling of the delays associated with instruction         
              and data broadcasting and the realization of global reduction operations       
              on response tags.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Pipelined systolic associative memory organizations are developed so           
              that they are truly scalable (up to sizes required for realistic               
              applications in the foreseeable future) within the potentials and              
              constraints of the VLSI technology and to evaluate their cost-                 
              effectiveness.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Tree-based, hypercube-based, and mesh-based VLSI search processors             
              having sublinear number of processors (with respect to the number of           
              keys or records) are examined and various design alternatives,                 
              optimality issues, and realization tradeoffs are analyzed .
