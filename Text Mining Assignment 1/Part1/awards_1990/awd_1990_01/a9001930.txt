Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An Elzone (Model 180XY) Particle Size Analyzer will be purchased.              
              The system produces precise and detailed grain-size data and will              
              have an immediate impact on both current and planned research                  
              projects by the principal investigator.  These include:  1) an ATM             
              study of the stratigraphic and geochronologic controls on                      
              sedimentation in Lake Turkana, Kenya;  2) an ongoing study of                  
              contourite deposition in Lake Superior;  3) a study of sediment                
              dynamics in the Great Lakes by Notre Dame's Environmental Research             
              Station.
