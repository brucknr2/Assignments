Abstract    :
              The International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics will hold              
              its 10th International Biophysics Congress and General Assembly                
              in Vancouver, Canada, July 29 to August 3, 1990.  The meeting                  
              offers a broad program of symposia on topics of current                        
              biophysical interest such as:  1) membrane organization and                    
              function; 2) macromolecular structure function recognition; 3)                 
              biophysical techniques; and 4) cell and bioenergetics.                         
                                                                                             
              Scientists of international reputation have been selected to                   
              serve as invited participants.  In addition, poster sessions will              
              provide for the latest research results to be discussed in                     
              detail.  This meeting provides the opportunity for U.S.                        
              scientists to meet outstanding foreign scientists, to present                  
              their work to an international audience and to, perhaps, begin                 
              important international collaborations.
