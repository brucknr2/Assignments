Abstract    :
              Continued funding for an ongoing undergraduate research program that           
              for five years has been training electrical engineering and computer           
              science students during the summers before their senior years is               
              sought.  Students will be recruited from a variety of other schools,           
              including primarily undergraduate institutions.  The research                  
              environment will be enriched by additional undergraduate students              
              funded from other sources.  Each participant will have regular                 
              meetings with an individual faculty mentor to plan work and review             
              progress throughout the eleven week program.  Project topics in                
              electrophysics will include artificial plasmas, microwave propagation.         
              microstrip antennas, frequency doubling in lasers, picosecond opto-            
              electronics, and thin film devices.  Information systems topics will           
              include image communication, multi-variable feedback control,                  
              continuous phase modulation digital signalling, LAN simulation tools,          
              and robotics.  All will benefit from extensive interactions with               
              participating faculty and graduate students.  Participants will have           
              informative tours of our research laboratories.  There will be two or          
              three seminar presentations to the group by leaders from industry,             
              universities or government agencies.  A tour will be arranged at a             
              nearby industrial lab or national laboratory.  The program will                
              terminate with a two-day research review during which each student             
              will make a presentation and answer abstract of his report.  A prize           
              will be awarded to the best project.
