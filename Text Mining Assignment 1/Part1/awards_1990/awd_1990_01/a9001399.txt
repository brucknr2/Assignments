Abstract    :
                   This award extends for one year the American Statistical                  
              Association project entitled "On- Site Research Program to Improve the         
              Quality of Labor Statistics".  The plan for subsequent years is to             
              effect a merger with similar on- site research programs conducted at           
              the Bureau of Census and the National Center for Education Statistics.         
                                                                                             
              The program,  which was initiated at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in         
              1987,  brings senior research fellows and associates to the Bureau for         
              periods of up to one year.  Its broadbased goal is to help bridge the          
              gap between academic scholars and governmental scientists by exposing          
              the fellows and associates to the methodological problems and policy           
              issues likely to be encountered only in a large scale Federal                  
              statistical agency and by exposing government social scientists to new         
              theoretical developments which might have application to their work.           
              Residence at the Bureau allows fellows and associates to carry out             
              research that would be difficult if not impossible to do without the           
              ready access to the data resources of the Bureau of Labor Statistics           
              which the program provides.
