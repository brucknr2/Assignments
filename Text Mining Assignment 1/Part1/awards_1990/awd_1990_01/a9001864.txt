Abstract    :
                   This award will help fund a conference in singularity                     
              theory.  This conference will be held from August 6 to 10, 1990                
              on the campus of the University of Hawaii, Manoa.  This                        
              conference will be concerned with all branches of singularity                  
              theory, but with emphasis on the following: (1) singularities of               
              mappings (real or complex), (2) singularities of real varieties,               
              (3) foundational properties: differential analysis, subanalytic                
              sets, etc., and (4) applications, e.g., to differential geometry.
