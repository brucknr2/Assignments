Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with two problems in quadratic                  
              form theory. The first concerns the existence of composition laws              
              for sums of squares. The second problem considers the connections              
              between the behavior of quadratic forms over a field of                        
              characteristic different than two and the types of Galois groups               
              which can arise over that field.                                               
                   This project is related to the classical study of quadratic               
              forms. One of the early achievements in this field is the                      
              discovery by Gauss that every positive whole number is the sum of              
              four squares. This area is important not only in pure number                   
              theory but in geometry and the mathematics of relativity.
