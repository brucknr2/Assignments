Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research in cultural anthropology studies the                
              effects on children's health of the education of mothers, the                  
              composition of the household, and involvement of mothers in local              
              woman's associations.  The research takes place in a rural area                
              of Cameroon.  Methods include a census and health survey of the                
              community, bi-monthly health surveys of a sample of households                 
              for a year, intensive case studies of at least five households,                
              and informal interviews with a wide range of government                        
              officials, health workers and family/community members.  This                  
              research is significant because it will contribute to the field                
              of medical anthropology, and will provide health planners with                 
              valuable information on the social mechanisms involved in child                
              health.
