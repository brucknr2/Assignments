Abstract    :
              This project describes a basic research program                                
              focused on the design and analysis of robust and H-                            
              infinity optimal feedback systems.  This research                              
              program has four major components: multivariable                               
              robust stability and stabilization problems, H-infinity                        
              optimal control of finite and infinite-dimensional                             
              systems, analysis and design of nonlinear time-                                
              varying controllers for robust control of linear time-                         
              invariant systems, controller design for multiple                              
              performance functionals.  To account for possible                              
              uncertainties in system models, both parametric and                            
              unstructured uncertainty in plant models will be                               
              considered.  Optimal design in the H-infinity norm                             
              is considered to provide robustness against                                    
              uncertainty in the spectra of the exogenous signals                            
              or unstructured dynamic modeling uncertainty.  It                              
              is also a key step in design for robust performance                            
              in the presence of unstructured uncertainty.  The                              
              emphasis is on the development of computationally                              
              efficient algorithms for controller design.  For this                          
              purpose, all high-level algorithms will be developed                           
              in terms state-space realizations, real or complex                             
              matrix algebraic equations, etc.  It is expected that                          
              most of the algorithms will be implementable on a                              
              variety of computers ranging from engineering                                  
              workstations to mainframe computers.
