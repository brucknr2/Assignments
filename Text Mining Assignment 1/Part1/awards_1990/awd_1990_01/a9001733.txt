Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this research is to develop a novel, efficient             
              technique of noncontacting laser phased array generation of                    
              ultrasound, for the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of solids and              
              processes.  The new technique uses an array of laser beams in place            
              of a single beam.  The research will include a basic study to                  
              evaluate the performance of and develop an analytical model for                
              the phased array.  Specific applications to noncontact NDE on-line             
              control of the depth of penetration and porosity during a gas metal            
              arc welding (GMAW) process will be pursued.  An electromagnetic                
              acoustic transducer will be used as a noncontact receiver.  The                
              research has five phases as follows: (1) development of an                     
              analytical model for predicting the generation of ultrasound by a              
              laser phased array; (2) experimental verification of the model for             
              the phased array;  (3) application of phased array to noncontact               
              NDE on-line control of the depth of weld pool penetration and                  
              porosity; (4) development of an analytical model for propagation               
              of sound through the weld pool; and (5) development of the data                
              acquisition system and algorithms.  The information on weld pool               
              penetration and porosity extracted from the ultrasonic signal will             
              be used in the system feedback for the welding power-supply,                   
              current, or speed control, to achieve the desired penetration and              
              porosity.
