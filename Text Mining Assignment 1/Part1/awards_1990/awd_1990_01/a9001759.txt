Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two broad aims of this research are to determine (1) the pathways              
              followed by sugars manufactured in the photosynthesizing cells                 
              (mesophyll cells) of the leaf to the food-conducting cells (sieve-tube         
              members) of the leaf veins, and (2) the sites at which the sugars are          
              actively secreted, or loaded, and unloaded in mature (source) and              
              immature (sink) leaves, respectively.  Detailed structural studies,            
              with light and electron microscopes, are complemented by experimental          
              studies, including localization of 14C-labeled sugars within the leaf          
              by microautoradiography; plasmolysis studies designed to determine the         
              solute (primarily sugar) concentrations of the various cell types; and         
              the use of fluorescent dyes to determine whether substances move from          
              cell to cell via cytoplasmic connection in their walls (symplastic             
              movement), via the cell wall continuum (apoplastic movement), or a             
              combination of the two.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The results of these studies will be of long-term practical importance         
              in relation to crop productivity and will be of great value to                 
              investigators interested in relations of viruses, insects, mycoplasmas,        
              and other parasites, and in the movement of insecticides and growth            
              regulating substances in cultivated plants.  Barley, maize, and                
              soybean, species to be studied, are economically important plants.
