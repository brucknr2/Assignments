Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a cooperative research project between                                 
              the University of Missouri (UMR) and the                                       
              National Cheng-Kung University (NCKU) in                                       
              Taiwan, to study the seismic behavior and                                      
              design of reinforced concrete low-rise shear                                   
              walls and building systems with openings.                                      
              NCKU will perform experimental and UMR will                                    
              conduct analytical studies.  The objectives                                    
              are:  1) mathematical formulation of load-                                     
              deflection of walls with coupling deformations                                 
              of bending, shear, axial,and bond slip, 2)                                     
              evaluation of stiffness reduction of walls and                                 
              structural systems after cracks, 3)                                            
              development of hysteresis models for bendings,                                 
              shear and axial, based on coupling behavior,                                   
              4) evaluation of damping coefficients at                                       
              various deformation stages, 5) statistical                                     
              studies of design parameters of reduction                                      
              factor, ductility and damage index, 6)                                         
              correlation of the analytical and experimental                                 
              results.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Recommendations for building code                                              
              revisions/improvements will be made for                                        
              engineering practice.
