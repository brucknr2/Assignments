Abstract    :
              A conventional scanning electron microscope will be acquired for                
                                                                                            
              use in a multiuser, campus-wide facility at Mississippi State                  
              University.  The high resolution achievable with a research-grade              
                                                                                             
              scanning electron microscope is essential to the projects of six               
                                                                                             
              major users and six minor users from diverse disciplines.  The                 
              former projects deal with the morphology of (1) fossil ostracods,              
                                                                                             
              (2) sensory receptors of water mites, (3) scent organs of moths,               
                                                                                             
              (4) seed coverings, (5) moth sensory organs and organs of host                 
              plants, and (6) fossil and recent diatoms.  The projects of the                
              six minor users deal with (1) intestinal nutrient transport in                 
              piglets, (2) particle sizing, (3) fungal infection of plant                    
              tissue, (4) paleomagnetism, (5) fungus and nematode colonization               
                                                                                             
              of roots, and (6) crustacean blood clotting and wound healing.
