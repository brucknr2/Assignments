Abstract    :
              To facilitate the exchange of ideas among workers interested in                
              computer applications in biology, an international meeting will                
              be held from 8-11 July 1990, at George Mason University.  The                  
              meeting will involve computer workshops, poster sessions, and                  
              plenary sessions with invited talks.  The plenary sessions will                
              treat the following specific areas:

                   -    Phylogeny and Systematics                                            
                   -    Enabling Technologies for BioInformatics                             
                   -    Artificial Intelligence and Philosophical Foundations

                   -    Modeling and Simulation                                              
                   -    Electronic Facilities for Scientific Communication                   
                                                                                             
              The meeting will also involve organizational sessions that will,               
              among other things, explore the formation of a BioMATRIX society               
              to provide a vehicle for further scientific exchange.
