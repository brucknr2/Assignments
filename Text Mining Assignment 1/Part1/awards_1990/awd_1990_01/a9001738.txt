Abstract    :
                   PI will collect and analyze a series of bulk molluscan                    
              skeletal samples contained within the sediment along an                        
              established transect in Salt River Bay, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin                 
              Islands.  These samples will be compared in detail with a                      
              corresponding suite of samples collected from the same locality                
              just prior to the passage of Hurricane Hugo, and will provide a                
              unique opportunity to assess directly the impact of a major storm              
              on several aspects of post-mortem skeletal alteration and                      
              transport.  Research will assess the role of storms in the                     
              formation of sedimentary strata and fossil accumulations.
