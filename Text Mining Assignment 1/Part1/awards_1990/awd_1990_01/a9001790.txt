Abstract    :
              This project will make theoretical and numerical investigations                
              of the nonlinear partial differential equations that describe                  
              structured models of cell population dynamics.  Individual cells               
              are distinguished by structure variables corresponding to size,                
              age, or other physical characteristics.  The populations are                   
              divided into population subclasses that interact through                       
              nonlinear transition rates.  The main objective will be to                     
              understand the qualitative behavior of the populations, the on-                
              set of oscillatory phenomena, and the response to external                     
              periodic loss functions.  The main methods will apply the theory               
              of semigroups of positive linear and nonlinear operators in                    
              Banach lattices.  The main applications will be to tumor cell                  
              populations with proliferating and quiescent classes and to                    
              multi-level blood cell  production systems.  The goal in the                   
              tumor cell population studies will be to understand the role of                
              quiescence in tumor growth and tumor therapy.  The goal in the                 
              blood cell population  studies will be to understand the                       
              regulation processes in normal and abnormal systems.
