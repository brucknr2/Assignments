Abstract    :
              Dr. Nancy E. Levinger has been awarded a Postdoctoral Resaerch                 
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Levinger's doctoral degree was                   
              from the University of Colorado under the supervision of                       
              Professor W. Carl Lineberger. Dr. Levinger intends to continue                 
              research at the University of Minnesota under the sponsorship                  
              of Professor Paul Barbara. Dr. Levinger's area of training and                 
              research will be the role of solvation in chemical reactions at                
              a molecular level.  Femtosecond spectroscopy will be used to                   
              distinguish solvent-mediated intermolecular charge-transfer                    
              reactions from intramolecular  charge-transfer reactions.                      
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
