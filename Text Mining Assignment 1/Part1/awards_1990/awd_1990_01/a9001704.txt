Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program explores the defect structure of quasicrystals,                   
              superconducting oxides, and amorphous alloys using the technique               
              of atomic pair distribution function analysis (PDF).  The PDF                  
              method has been employed primarily for amorphous solids and                    
              liquids and is now being used in the examination of non-periodic               
              atomic displacements in more ordered solids.  The PDF method is                
              refined further in this research, which examines the statistical               
              noise, lattice dynamics, and techniques for improved accuracy in               
              the differential anomalous x-ray scattering experiments.  The                  
              main focus of the grant is on developing understanding of defect               
              structure in the above materials, which have high incidence of                 
              atoms which deviate in position from their average sites.
