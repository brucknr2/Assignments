Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to build cost-effective specialized computers for           
              scientific computation.  A set of hardware and software will be                
              developed to allow rapid construction of very specialized computers:           
              computers that are capable of running exactly one program.  The                
              computers are built from many data path parts, interconnected to reflect       
              the control flow of the program to be executed.  Several of these              
              computers are under construction for different problems, including the         
              n-body problem of predicting planetary motions, some electronic                
              simulation problems, and large-scale particle simulations.  Comparison         
              with other computational approaches to this problem will allow an              
              accurate evaluation of this technique.
