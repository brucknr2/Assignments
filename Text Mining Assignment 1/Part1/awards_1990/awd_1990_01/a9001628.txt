Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplemental support to enable Dr. Justin              
              Schwartz of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to conduct               
              collaborative research for six months with Dr. Kiyoshi Inoue of                
              the National Research Institute for Metals (NRIM) in Tsukuba,                  
              Japan.  They will address some of the key development issues for               
              superconducting magnets.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Any practical application of high temperature ceramic supercon-                
              ductors will require a tremendous research and development effort.             
              Dr. Schwartz will participate in two on-going projects at NRIM,                
              one involving design optimization of the coil for a high field                 
              pulsed magnet, and the second looking at long tape, Ag-sheathed,               
              Bi-system high temperature superconductors.  NRIM has been                     
              involved in the design and optimization of high field research                 
              magnets for many years and should thus provide an ideal setting                
              for this young U.S. scientist to participate in pioneering research.
