Abstract    :
                   Graduate student Jose Villasenor under the guidance of Dr.                
              Tom Elias of Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden is studying the                   
              Mexican and Guatemalan species of Senecio section Mulgedifolii, a              
              poorly known group of tropical montane sunflower relatives.  He                
              plans a broad survey of features of morphology, chromosome                     
              composition, and analysis of variation in chloroplast DNA.  The                
              goals include evaluation of morphological characters that provide              
              stable, reliable guides to the identification of species; mapping              
              of the geographic distributions of the estimated 15 or so species              
              throughout Mesoamerica; and inference of the evolutionary                      
              relationships among these species and with closely related groups              
              of Senecio.                                                                    
                   Villasenor has published a number of papers on the plant                  
              resources of Mexico, and has conducted field work in several                   
              regions of the country.  The broad approach he is taking to the                
              study of plant biodiversity, encompassing both traditional                     
              morphological investigation and laboratory analysis of genetic                 
              and genomic variation, will bring increased understanding of                   
              tropical plant resources in the Americas, and in turn the                      
              research will contribute to training of the next generation of                 
              plant scientists.
