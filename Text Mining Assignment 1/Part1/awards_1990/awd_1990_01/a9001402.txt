Abstract    :
              With this award the principal investigator will continue his                   
              application of asymptotic methods of singular perturbation type                
              to the study of bifurcation problems and moving boundary problems              
              that arise from reaction-diffusion systems.  In particular, he                 
              will investigate so-called singular bifurcation problems, wherein              
              small changes in the bifurcation parameter can cause large                     
              responses in the system, laser instabilities, and the changing                 
              time history of the moving interface in certain pharmaceutical                 
              problems involving the time-release of medication. This proposal               
              is concerned with bifurcation phenomena.  As an illustration,                  
              stand a plastic ruler on its end and push on the top end.  If you              
              do not push very hard nothing happens.  But if you push                        
              sufficiently hard the first thing that happens is that the ruler               
              bows, either to the left or to the right.  We call this a                      
              bifurcation:  the configuration of the straight ruler has split                
              (bifurcated) into one of two possible shapes.  Applying still                  
              more force to the ruler results in an even number of bowed shapes              
              having more and more curves.  The principal investigator will                  
              study the number of solutions that bifurcate from a given                      
              solution of systems of equations that govern lasers and release                
              of chemicals in the body.
