Abstract    :
              This dissertation proposal aims to develop a better                            
              understanding of women's movement into management positions in                 
              corporate-government relations.  This study provides a way to                  
              study an occupation whose gender composition is in transition                  
              and a basis for understanding a transition in the character and                
              function of corporate-government relations.  The student will                  
              investigate the behavior and organization of corporate political               
              action committees (PACs).  The study will facilitate                           
              understanding changes in the character and function of                         
              corporate-government relations and their relationship to the                   
              political goals of corporations.  The student will interview in                
              depth PAC officials and men and women in corporate-government                  
              relations.  A survey based on the interviews will be mailed to                 
              government relations officers in 309 corporations.
