Abstract    :
                   The research on this grant concerns the global structure                  
              theory for arbitrary infinite semigroups. Applications will be                 
              given to formal languages, infinite group theory, and decision                 
              problems. The mathematical development will consist of the                     
              following: general machinery, the kernel of a morphism between                 
              semigroups, expansions, the prime decomposition theorem for                    
              arbitrary semigroups and applications.                                         
                   This research is in the area of semigroups. A semigroup is                
              one of the simplest of the abstract mathematical structures,                   
              consisting of a set with one associative operation on it. The                  
              structure of these very general objects will be investigated.                  
              Applications will be given to various areas of mathematics and                 
              computer science.
