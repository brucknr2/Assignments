Abstract    :
              There has been much debate in recent years over whether countries              
              will tend in the long run to converge to the same level of                     
              productivity which can be measured in terms of per capita income.              
              In practice, the debate concerns the question of whether poor                  
              countries tend to have higher per capita income growth rates than              
              rich ones, or put another way: is there a tendency for poor                    
              countries to "catch up"?  The purpose of this research is to                   
              integrate data and growth theory to focus on the question of                   
              economic convergence.  This project will involve an empirical and              
              theoretical investigation of the causes of convergence or lack                 
              thereof.  The approach taken to the question of catching up                    
              begins by restating the question as one concerning the effects of              
              initial conditions on subsequent growth.  It is the contention in              
              this study that initial per capita income is too aggregate a                   
              measure of initial conditions on which to base our expectations                
              of a country's subsequent growth.  By disaggregating initial                   
              conditions in a growth-theoretic context it is possible to                     
              greatly improve our understanding of why some poor countries have              
              grown much faster than rich countries while others have note.                  
              This project is important because it will provide new insights                 
              about the prospects for economic growth in the less developed                  
              countries.
