Abstract    :
                   Space science has long sought the answer to the cause for                 
              different types of auroral structures and their occurrence at                  
              different times within the global magnetic activity.  The                      
              research scientists in this program have in the past attempted to              
              trace the effects of currents from the ionosphere near quiet time              
              auroral structures into the magnetosphere using quiet time                     
              magnetic field models.  This new project will use a more                       
              disturbed model of the magnetosphere to investigate more dynamic               
              structures associated with the auroral substorm, such as auroral               
              loops, poleward surges and  omega bands. In addition, this new                 
              model  will allow study of mapping effects produced by the                     
              diversion of cross-tail current to the ionosphere.  These studies              
              of the coupling between electron and ion currents in the inner                 
              magnetotail  may help to unravel some of the physical processes                
              that take place during the auroral substorm onset.
