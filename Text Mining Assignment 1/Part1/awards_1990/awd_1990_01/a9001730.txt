Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports cooperative research in enzyme biochemistry                
              between William Stahl of the University of Washington in                       
              Seattle and Marta Antonelli of the Institute of Cellular                       
              Biology in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  The study will examine                    
              the role of specific sequences of isoforms of the catalytic                    
              subunit of the Na,K-ATPase in ouabain binding.  One important                  
              goal is to establish whether the C-terminus of the catalytic                   
              subunit is intracelular or extracellular.  In addition, a                      
              long term goal is to establish localization of isoforms with                   
              different ouabain binding characteristics by light microscope                  
              immunocytochemistry.  Dr. Antonelli has support for this work                  
              at the Institute through collaboration with its Director,                      
              Jorge Saavedra's immunocytochemistry group.  The have                          
              extensive experience in light and electron microscope                          
              immunocytochemistry.  Their methodologies have been utilized                   
              by Dr. Stahl in his laboratory.                                                
                                                                                             
              The collaboration will provide an opportunity to make use of                   
              the excellent facilities in Argentina for localization of the                  
              Na,K-ATPase isoforms to provide insight into the structure of                  
              the cardiac glycoside binding site in different isoforms of                    
              the catalytic subunit.  This is complementary to studies in                    
              Seattle on expression of mRNAs coding for isoforms with high                   
              and low affinities for cardiac glycosides.  Brought together                   
              in this collaboration, these efforts will provide a broader,                   
              more comprehensive approach to understanding functional                        
              aspects of Na,K-ATPases.
