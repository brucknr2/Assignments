Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The application of this state-of-the-art Solid State NMR                       
              Spectrometer is for the characterization of traditional and                    
              unique materials formed from various types of composites, polymer              
              blends, glasses, and ceramics.  Detection of various nuclei of H,              
              C, N, Al, Si, and P isotopes are included, along with studies of               
              polymers used in non-linear optics and membranes for separation                
              technology.  Other materials include organometallic precursors to              
              nitrides and carbides, organic precursors to inorganic ceramics,               
              and various intermediates involved in the calcination process.
