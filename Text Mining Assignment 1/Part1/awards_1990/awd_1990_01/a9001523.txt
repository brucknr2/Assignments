Abstract    :
                   This research is devoted to the study of choice of the form               
              of the statistical regression function in terms of the exogenous               
              variables in the model when the number of exogenous variables is               
              large. The common practice is to impose conditions such as                     
              linearity or additivity to avoid the difficulties associated with              
              sparse data in high dimensions. Estimates of average derivative                
              functionals will be used to select or reject a particular                      
              restriction on the form of the regression. The functionals                     
              considered are of integral type which may allow their estimation               
              at the usual parametric rate. Estimators of these functionals                  
              which are based on kernel density estimators will be considered                
              and their large sample properties analyzed. These estimators will              
              then be used to test various hypotheses concerning the form of                 
              the regression function. The finite sample behavior of the                     
              proposed estimators and tests will be studied using constructed                
              and real data. Under certain conditions these estimators will be               
              studied for their use in identifying projection directions in                  
              projection pursuit regression. Similar functionals closely                     
              resembling the Fisher information matrix  will be used to                      
              determine directions in projection pursuit density estimation.
