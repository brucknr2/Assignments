Abstract    :
              Northwestern University will purchase an inductively coupled plasma            
              spectrometer in order to carry out analyses of chemical elements               
              in the fields of anthropology, biophysics, and bioinorganic                    
              chemistry.  The instrument is needed by the faculties of the                   
              Department of Chemistry and the Department of Biochemistry,                    
              Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology for research in the following              
              areas:                                                                         
                                                                                             
                   1. Diet and the inorganic analysis of excavated human bone                
                   2. Heavy metals in biological systems                                     
                   3. Long-range electron transfer and hemoglobin function                   
                   4. Polynucleotide coordination chemistry of metallocene                   
                      antitumor agents                                                       
                                                                                             
              At present, the institution does not have an inductively coupled               
              plasma spectrometer, so its acquisition will be a significant                  
              addition, enhancing both current and future research efforts.
