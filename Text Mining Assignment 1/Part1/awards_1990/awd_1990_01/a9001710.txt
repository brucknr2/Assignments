Abstract    :
                   The topics of investigation range over a wide spectrum in                 
              probability and statistics.  They include probability problems                 
              arising from Computer Science, random trees, asymptotic theory of              
              prediction regions and of confidence regions, distances between                
              empirical processes and their Gaussian counterparts, minimum                   
              distance methods, stochastic estimation procedures, inference for              
              time series with infinite variance, non-parametric function                    
              estimation, set statistics, and contour estimation. Many of the                
              studies will be computer intensive.
