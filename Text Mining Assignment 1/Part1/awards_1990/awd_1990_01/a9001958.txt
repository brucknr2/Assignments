Abstract    :
              This program is designed to attract undergraduate, particularly women          
              and minorities, into lasers and optics research,  with emphasis on             
              lightwave technology as an emerging technology.  Many recent studies,          
              including the National of Academies recent report on Photonics,                
              identify this as one of the key technical growth areas of the future.          
              Inspiration for these students to continue into graduate school will           
              come from participating in research projects within the                        
              interdisciplinary Center for Laser Studies.  This research                     
              organization is unusual for its large percentage of women and                  
              minorities, both on its staff and in its graduate student population.          
              In 1989 the Center received REU site funding and developed a very              
              successful program which included three Chicanos, two females and one          
              black student.  This gives the Center a chance to better recruit               
              minority and women undergraduates and to provide more opportunity to           
              participate in research, inspiring them to continue in graduate                
              students.  The projects include noise properties of semiconductor              
              arrays, characterization of nonlinear services, fabrication and                
              characterization of heterojunction lasers, solid stat lasers, fiber-           
              optics power-by-light headset, and thermal transport in thin films.
