Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will investigate several                      
              questions in stochastic analysis, most of which involve white                  
              noise calculus and its applications.  In particular, they will                 
              study the localization of forward and backward integrals,                      
              multiple stochastic integrals, existence and uniqueness of                     
              stochastic differential equations with anticipating                            
              coefficients, comparison with other approaches in the theory of                
              anticipating stochastic differential equations.
