Abstract    :
              An investigation of quantum effects in very thin metal films and               
              metal clusters prepared by vapor-deposition on to substrates held              
              at liquid He temperatures.  Secondly, a study of the electric and              
              magnetic properties of selected superconducting (sc) wire network              
              and wire proximity array geometries as models for aspects of                   
              percolation, localization, and the (sc) glass.
