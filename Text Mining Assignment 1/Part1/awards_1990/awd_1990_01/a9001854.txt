Abstract    :
              Description:  This project provides support for twelve U.S.                    
              scientists to participate in the International Conference on                   
              Quantum Optics, to be held in Hyderabad, India January 5-9, 1991.              
              The conference's aims include interaction between scientists from              
              India, neighboring countries, Europe and the U.S., and                         
              encouragement of cooperative research.  The program covers recent              
              development in: squeezed states and nonclassical light; quantum                
              theory of measurement and interferometers; cavity QED; photon                  
              statistics and optical phenomena; optical phenomena in superintense            
              fields; topological places in nonlinear and quantum phenomena;                 
              coherence theory; laser cooling and trapping of ions and neutral               
              atoms; new mechanism of laser action; resonance fluorescence;                  
              quantum jumps, optical bistability; and light induced drift.  The              
              Indian convener is Dr. G.S. Agarwal of the School of Physics,                  
              University of Hyderabad who is an active scientist in the field                
              with a long record of successful collaborative research with  U.S.             
              scientists.  The invited U.S. participants are eminently qualified             
              and active scientists who can benefit from and contribute to the               
              conference.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This activity is beneficial to the Indian and U.S.                     
              scientists by enabling them to interact with colleagues from Europe            
              and India, as well as develop cooperative activities between                   
              scientists of the two countries.  It is likely the maximum benefits            
              will be for scientists from smaller Indian universities who have               
              few chances for such interaction.
