              The dissertation examines the acquisition of the tone and                      
              accent systems of KiVunjo Chagga, a Bantu language spoken in                   
              the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania.  Although it is widely                     
              believed that infants acquire prosodic systems very early,                     
              there is evidence from English and Asian tone languages that                   
              distinctive pitch is not acquired prior to segmental phonology.                
              There has been no comprehensive study of the acquisition of                    
              tone in a Bantu-type tone language.  This research pays                        
              particular attention to the development of distinctive tone,                   
              its relationship to the metrical accent system of KiVunjo, and                 
              the development of tone rules.  Field research consists of a                   
              longitudinal naturalistic study of four children, two from age                 
              2 and two from age 3, thereby covering the age range 2-4.  The                 
              children will be audio recorded in their homes once a month for                
              at least one year.  Recording sessions will last an entire day,                
              and will cover a wide range of the child's normal activities                   
              and interlocutors.  Tapes will be transcribed immediately with                 
              the help of a native-speaker assistant, and transcripts will be                
              entered into a computer.  The resulting corpus will be                         
              available to other researchers.
