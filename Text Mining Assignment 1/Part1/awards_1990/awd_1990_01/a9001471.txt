Abstract    :
              In collaboration with the Murmansk Institute of Marine                         
              Biology and Geology, USSR, this project will initiate basic                    
              glacial geologic, stratigraphic and geochronologic studies                     
              to provide new field data to independently evaluate the                        
              extent and timing of Late Weischselian and older                               
              glaciations.  Field research will focus on the western part                    
              of the Franz Josef Land Archipelago, where ice-free                            
              forelands contain abundant raised marine and glacial                           
              features.  High resolution SPOT satellite imagery will be                      
              used as a mapping base to determine the distribution of                        
              raised beaches, moraines and other glacial features.                           
              Geomorphic and pedologic studies will provide relative ages                    
              for a previously isostatic response will be documented by                      
              radiocarbon dating of fossils included in raised beaches of                    
              known elevation.  Particular attention will be given to the                    
              recognition of glacial-diamicts and uncomformitites, the                       
              collection of micro and macro-fauna for paleenvironmental                      
              assessment, and radiocarbon dating and amino acid                              
              racemization analyses.  These studies will provide new                         
              insight into the history and extent of Late Weichselian                        
              glaciations on Franz Josef Land and will provide needed data                   
              to evaluate conflicting hypotheses regarding Late                              
              Weichselian ice volumes in northern Eurasia.
