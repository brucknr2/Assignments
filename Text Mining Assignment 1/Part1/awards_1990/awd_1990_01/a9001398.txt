Abstract    :
              This award provides support to The University of Minnesota to                  
              continue the summer program of undergraduate research experiences              
              in the behavioral sciences established in 1987.  The ten-week                  
              program emphasizes student participation in the research activities            
              of faculty affiliated with the Center of Liberal Arts.  Eleven                 
              undergraduates will participate, two-thirds from private liberal               
              arts colleges in the state of Minnesota and one-third from the                 
              University; they will be expected to have completed their junior               
              year.  Student's will:  (1) assist with a faculty member's research            
              including opportunities to work as a member of a research team, (2)            
              complete a research project, the final product of which will be a              
              written report and a presentation to peers and participating                   
              faculty, and (3) participate in a multidisciplinary seminar.                   
              Seminar activities include presentations by program faculty and                
              faculty in related areas campus wide, laboratory tours, and                    
              lectures on research tools and design.  The program will therefore             
              include opportunities for the students to learn specific research              
              methods, to apply these methods in the context of their own                    
              research, and to examine broad conceptual and methodological issues            
              relating to psychology and the cognitive sciences.  Participation              
              in social/cultural events as well as common housing in a University            
              dorm will help foster a strong community of students.
