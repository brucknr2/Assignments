Abstract    :
              This research project is developing a new technique, based on the              
              detection of interface elastic waves by Brillouin scattering, to               
              measure the bulk elastic constants of solids under hundreds of                 
              kilobars of hydrostatic pressure.  This unique capability will                 
              permit the investigation of the almost universal softening of                  
              acoustic phonons with pressure in cubic semiconductors and their               
              potential role in structural phase transitions.  Measurements on               
              semiconductor alloys and heterostructures will allow isolation of              
              compositional and interfacial strain effects.  Resonant Raman                  
              scattering will be employed to study the exchange-mediated phonon              
              renormalization discovered in cobalt-based dilute magnetic                     
              semiconductors.  Antoher program on II-V semiconductors is                     
              attempting to elucidate the fundamental driving mechanism for                  
              their novel ordering during epitaxial growth and to explore the                
              possibility to stabilize through strain otherwise unstable                     
              crystal lattices.
