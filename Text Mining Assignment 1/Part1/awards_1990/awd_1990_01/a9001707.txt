Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  One investigator will study problems in the areas of                      
              rigidity theorems for Riemannian manifolds, the structure of                   
              manifolds without conjugate points, and sharp isoperimetric                    
              inequalities.  A second investigator will study related problems               
              in the areas of degenerate systems of partial differential                     
              equations, isospectral deformations of Riemannian structures, and              
              minimal isometric embeddings of spherical space forms in spheres.              
                   The problems to be investigated in this project arise from                
              an example due to Milnor of two isospectral manifolds which are                
              not isometric.  While the original example was sixteen                         
              dimensional, more recently three dimensional examples have been                
              constructed.  Analogously, one might ask if two round drums which              
              have the same rough shape and which sound the same when struck,                
              have the same exact shape.  In fact, they must.  These two                     
              investigators will study related deep questions for higher                     
              dimensional hypersurfaces.
