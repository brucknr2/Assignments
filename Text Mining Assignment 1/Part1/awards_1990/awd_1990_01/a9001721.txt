Abstract    :
                   This research  involves convexity-related inequalities and                
              positive dependence in statistics.  The related areas in                       
              statistics include multivariate analysis, reliability theory,                  
              multiple decision problems, and statistical computing. The                     
              mathematical tools to be used are convexity, majorization theory,              
              conditioning and mixture of distributions. The research will                   
              provide a partial ordering of positive dependence among random                 
              variables via multivariate majorization. The effects of positive               
              dependence in system reliability theory will be explored. Open                 
              problems in optimal-partitioning inequalities will be studied                  
              and a comparison of statistical experiments via positive                       
              dependence will be made.
