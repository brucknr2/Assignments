Abstract    :
              Experimental program on electromagnetic propagation in random                  
              structures.  Observation of photon localization in the near                    
              future is a specific goal.  Approaches include the use of both                 
              light and microwave radiation.  The cross-correlation of                       
              fluctuations in intensity will be measured as a function of                    
              separation between two points.  The physical systems which are                 
              employed in the experiments consist of metallic or high-index                  
              dielectric spheres imbedded in a transparant medium.                           
              Measurements will be made in the diffusive, critical, and                      
              localized regimes.
