Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will complete the study of two-                
              generator subgroups of PSL(2,R).  The investigation will result                
              in a complete and unified account of the geometric and algebraic               
              approaches to this classification problem, as well as a complete               
              description of the relationship between this algebra and                       
              geometry. The investigator will also study an extension of these               
              methods to the complex numbers and to several real variables.                  
                   The work to be completed by the principal investigator has                
              as one of its ramifications the complete understanding of tilings              
              of the plane by tiles invariant under some sort of discrete group              
              action.  These have been of interest to mathematicians for more                
              than a century and their study was recently revived by W.                      
              Thurston.  Connections between this investigation and the                      
              topology of three dimensional hypersurfaces as well as to                      
              dynamical systems, abound.
