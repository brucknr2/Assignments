Abstract    :
              In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                 
              Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Hall will develop                 
              new mathematical models for the study of clusters of metals                    
              such as sodium.  This will eventually lead to more complex                     
              investigations of disordered condensed phases.                                 
                                                                                             
              The path integral formulation of quantum mechanics will be used                
              to study sodium metal clusters, the elctron gas, and as a means                
              for determining the Mott transition in sodium.  The long term                  
              goal of this research is to develop methods that are capable of                
              determining correlated electron properties in disordered                       
              condensed phase systems.  The studies of sodium metal clusters                 
              will focus on determining the extent of electron delocalization                
              as a function of cluster size.  The electron gas and bulk                      
              sodium calculations will investigate aspects of the                            
              insulator-metal transition.
