Abstract    :
                   Professor Buechler's research in mathematical logic is in                 
              stability theory, a subfield of model theory.  In recent years                 
              several general model-theoretic problems have been systematically              
              approached via the stability hierarchy.  Even though the problem               
              itself may not involve stability-theoretic notions, considering                
              separately the cases:  omega-stable, superstable, etc., brings                 
              into play a mass of technical machinery.  Such is the case for                 
              Vaught's conjecture, which was proved by Shelah for omega-stable               
              theories.  The next step is to consider all superstable theories,              
              but this has proved too difficult for the methods used in the                  
              omega-stable case.  What is required is an analysis which is                   
              sensitive to the way in which, e.g., sets of rank alpha are                    
              pieced together to form sets of rank alpha plus one.  Buechler                 
              will continue with this geometrical approach to the problem,                   
              which has already yielded significant results.
