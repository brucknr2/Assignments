Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to understand the behavior of                
              solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations by using                 
              asymptotic methods of singular perturbation type.  Two kinds of                
              problems will be investigated:  the slow crossing of a separatrix              
              due to a weak dissipative perturbation and the development of a                
              method of averaging for slowly varying waves influenced by weak                
              perturbations.  Such equations arise in a host of areas where the              
              behavior of nonlinear waves is the primary physical process.                   
                   Many phenomena in nature involve the action of weakly                     
              nonlinear waves.  Examples include the motion of the tides as                  
              well as the daily bodily rhythms of waking and sleeping.  Such                 
              complex systems can be approximated sometimes by systems of                    
              partial differential equations that contain one or more small                  
              parameters.  In this research the principal investigator will use              
              the smallness of these parameters to construct approximate                     
              solutions of the equations by replacing the complicated equations              
              with simpler ones.  The simpler equations still retain the                     
              essential physics of the complicated ones, but they are much                   
              easier to study.
