Abstract    :
              Dr. Beers will complete an objective prism survey of the northern              
              and southern hemispheres of our Galaxy and then follow up on                   
              selected stars which have extremely low metal abundances and                   
              stars on the horizontal branch of their evolutionary track.  The               
              final database of candidates should include about 16,000 stars                 
              with relatively low abundances of iron, and about 25,000                       
              horizontal branch stars will be identified.                                    
                                                                                             
              The halo of our Galaxy contains less than 1 percent of the                     
              luminous stars in the entire Galaxy.  Yet the halo is fundamental              
              for revealing crucial issues of stellar evolution, the processes               
              of galaxy formation and evolution, and for constraining the                    
              distribution of matter throughout the Galaxy.  To understand the               
              halo, one must first find it and characterize it.  Ideally,                    
              complete spectroscopic and photometric information for the                     
              approximately one billion luminous stars which populate the halo               
              would allow the observer to draw a picture of the halo which is                
              untainted by sampling bias.  Short of this, one can only attempt               
              to minimize the effects of any selection criteria which must be                
              imposed to make the problem tractable.  In its broadest sense,                 
              the purpose of Dr. Beers' survey is to discover the objects which              
              will, eventually, allow for a much more complete understanding of              
              the halo of our Galaxy.
