Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Interstellar Scattering Disks.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Dr. Gwinn will carry out a radio wavelength observational study of             
              the shapes of scattering disks in the interstellar medium and of               
              their temporal variations.  The observations include Very Long                 
              Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements of the sizes of the                
              scattering disks of pulsars over periods of years; sensitive VLBI              
              observations of the scattering disks of hydroxyl masers; and a                 
              search for speckles in the scattering disk of the Vela pulsar.                 
                                                                                             
              Radio wavelength scattering in the interstellar plasma limits the              
              resolution and positional accuracy of observations of many radio               
              sources and will become more important as a limit as VLBI baselines            
              are extended into space and the accuracy of astrometric VLBI                   
              approaches the microarcsecond level.  Large scale plasma                       
              fluctuations, acting as lenses, can focus and defocus radiation                
              from pulsars and quasars, producing the observed low frequency                 
              variability of these sources.  Dr. Gwinn's research is directed                
              toward improving our understanding of the properties of the                    
              scattering plasma.
