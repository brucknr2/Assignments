Abstract    :
                   This award will provide support to a group from                           
              Southeastern Massachusetts University to pursue their research                 
              in elementary particle physics.  They are involved in a diverse                
              program at Brookhaven National Laboratory to study the basic                   
              constituents of matter, quarks and gluons.  The experiments are                
              performed with a large particle detector known as the                          
              multiparticle spectrometer for which the SMU physicists have                   
              made important contributions to the apparatus and are now                      
              involved in the data analysis.  The newest of these experiments                
              is a major program in hadron spectroscopy designed to detect                   
              multiple gamma final states for the search and the unambiguous                 
              identification of various meson states.
