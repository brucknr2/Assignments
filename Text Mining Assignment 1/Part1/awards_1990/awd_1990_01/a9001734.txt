Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study the problems of                     
              smoothing parameter (bandwidth) selection for nonparametric                    
              models, and order selection for linear models.  Nonparametric                  
              and linear models have been used extensively in many fields.                   
              Although there are many procedures available for selecting the                 
              bandwidth or the order, it is recognized that the classical                    
              selectors are subject to large sample variation, and thus may                  
              not be very useful in practice.  Recently, using the technique                 
              of Fourier analysis, the investigator proposed some stabilized                 
              procedures to reduce the variation in selecting the bandwidth                  
              for kernel regression of density estimation.  This project will                
              follow the approach recently obtained by the investigator to                   
              study the bandwidth or order selection problems for several                    
              important cases, which include boundary effects, random design                 
              points, order selection for autoregressive processes, extraction               
              of periodic components, point processes, and robust smoothers.
