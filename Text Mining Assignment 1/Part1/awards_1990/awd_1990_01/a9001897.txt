Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The two principal investigators will study the isolation of               
              a geometric aspect of integrability, singularity analysis of Toda              
              equations and stratification of Bruhat cells, solutions to the                 
              sine-Gordon equations involving constant mean curvature tori                   
              immersed in spheres, and the universal enveloping algebra                      
              associated with properties of Poisson brackets.                                
                   This project concerns deep properties of Hamiltonian                      
              systems.  These are systems of differential equations which                    
              describe in particular the motion of mechanical devices.  Such                 
              devices must conserve both energy and momentum.  Recently,                     
              various algebraic methods as well as Painleve analysis of                      
              integrability has been used to make considerable progress toward               
              the understanding of such systems.  This project will contribute               
              to these developments.
