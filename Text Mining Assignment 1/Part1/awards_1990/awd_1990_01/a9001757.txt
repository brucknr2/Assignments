Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable                        
              Dr. Jaxk Reeves of the University of Georgia to conduct                        
              collaborative research for 12 months with Dr. Masami Hasegawa                  
              of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics in Tokyo, Japan.                   
              Using the complete mitochondrial genome of several completely                  
              sequenced animal species (human, cow, mouse, frog, fruit fly),                 
              the researchers will apply statistical techniques to obtain                    
              estimates and standard errors thereof of the long-term                         
              substitution rates of the elemental DNA bases (A,C,G,T).  In                   
              addition, they will obtain estimates and standard errors of the                
              relative time-distances between various species' branchings.                   
                                                                                             
              The approach to be used is novel in that the complete                          
              mitochondrial DNA genome of five animal species will be used;                  
              approximately 16,500 base pairs for each.  This will allow the                 
              researchers to address the questions of whether the rate of                    
              specific base pair substitution has been approximately constant                
              over the millions of years of evolutionary history, and what                   
              effect position in the sequence has on substitution rates.                     
              Dr. Hasegawa is an established leader in the application of                    
              statistics to the field of genetics, and the Institute of                      
              Statistical Mathematics should prove an ideal environment for                  
              Dr. Reeves to pursue and expand his research.
