Abstract    :
                   Among the living primates the genus Lemur is one of the most               
                                                                                            
              complicated from the taxonomic point of view.  There are six                   
              recognized species and one, Lemur fulvus, occurs in seven                      
              allopatric subspecies.  Their relationships to one another and                 
              the mode of their genetic differentiation is not known.  The PI                
              will examine levels of genetic differentiation associated with                 
              various stages in the process of speciation and, using data from               
              the genus Lemur, will examine the model of allopatric speciation.              
                                                                                             
              Specifically, the PI will test the hypothesis that there is                    
              progressively greater genetic differentiation as comparisons are               
              made among geographic populations, then subspecies, and finally                
              species.  These data will also be used to address the systematics              
                                                                                             
              of lemurs, and specifically whether Lemur fulvus is ancestral to               
              other species in the genus, as has been proposed.
