Abstract    :
                   Theoretical and numerical studies will be initiated for an                
              array of problems in gravitational physics and relativistic                    
              astrophysics.  Topics of interest include (1) development of                   
              techniques in numerical relativity and their application in                    
              modeling sources of gravitational radiation and in exploring                   
              nonlinear, dynamical spacetimes; (2) numerical modeling of the                 
              tidal disruption of stars during close encounters with massive                 
              black holes and the possible relevance of disruption for                       
              feeding active galactic nuclei; (3) the calculation of                         
              magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds from accretion disks and stars                 
              and the development of a general relativistic MHD numerical                    
              scheme; and (4) a study of the recently discovered eclipsing                   
              millisecond pulsar 1957+20.  The goal of this work is to                       
              acquire a deeper understanding of self-gravitating and                         
              dynamical systems and of high energy (relativistic) phenomena.                 
              Many of these physical studies rely upon the use of large-scale                
              numerical modeling techniques.  Accordingly, useful byproducts                 
              of such studies are almost invariably new and refined numerical                
              algorithms.  The project relating to the eclipsing pulsar                      
              1957+20 is of a more phenomenological nature and relies upon                   
              the close interplay between theoretical calculation and                        
              observational evidence.
