Abstract    :
              The Gordon Research Conferences are held every summer to discuss               
              the recent findings and current thinking in various areas of                   
              science.  Although participation is limited, the attendees                     
              usually consist of established scientists, young investigators                 
              who are making important contributions in these areas and                      
              postdoctoral fellows.  They are held in small, isolated New                    
              England towns away from other distractions and conducive to the                
              exchange of ideas.  These conferences have a recognized value for              
              presenting the latest advances in research and also indicating                 
              the future trends which are likely to be most productive.
