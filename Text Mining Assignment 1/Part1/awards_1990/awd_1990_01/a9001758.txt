Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable                        
              Dr. Elizabeth Klerman of the Harvard Medical School to conduct                 
              collaborative research for 12 months with Dr. K. Aihara of Tokyo               
              Denki University, Japan.  They will investigate the significance               
              of chaos in neural information processing by analyzing the                     
              characteristics of artificial neural networks composed of neurons              
              with chaotic dynamics.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The nonlinear phenomena of deterministic chaos is now recognized as            
              ubiquitous in fields such as feedback systems, optics, ecology and             
              biological systems.  This project will attempt to demonstrate the              
              effects of chaotic fluctuations in applications of network and                 
              neurocomputing.  For example, since chaotic neurons can produce                
              macroscopic fluctuations spontaneously, they may provide a means               
              of escaping from undesirable local minima in problems of optimiza-             
              tion, learning and self organization.  Dr. Aihara's background in              
              mathematical modeling of chaotic neurons will complement Dr.                   
              Klerman's research experience in the area of circadian rhythms.
