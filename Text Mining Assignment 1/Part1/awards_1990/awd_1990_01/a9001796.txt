Abstract    :
                   Professor Montgomery-Smith will conduct research into the                 
              study of the cotype 2 constant of operators from C(K) to any                   
              Banach space.  This is intended to fill a gap on what is already               
              known about how cotype 2 relates to operators from C(K) which has              
              so far dealt only with operators which factor through a space of               
              cotype 2.  This research will involve the study of Rademacher                  
              processes.  This is a recent but very natural area.  It takes as               
              its starting point the well studied Gaussian processes.                        
                   This research is at the interface of two fields: probability              
              and operator theory on infinite dimensional spaces.  Properties                
              of operators (infinite dimensional matrices) are studied using                 
              ideas from probability and conversely the quest to understand                  
              these operators leads to new and interesting questions in pure                 
              probability.
