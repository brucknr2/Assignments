Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Several critical issues are examined related to fatigue crack                  
              initiation and microcrack growth.  Included are the effects of                 
              subsurface environmental species on fatigue; the role of surface               
              reactivity on fatigue life; theoretical analysis of the slip band              
              spacing; and effects of material type.  The significance of                    
              subsurface incorporation of environmental species on fatigue is                
              determined by measuring fatigue crack initiation in selected                   
              gaseous environments (oxygen and other selected gases).  The                   
              correlation between slip band spacing and fatigue life is                      
              examined to extend current theory on periodic slip band arrays                 
              and their influence on crack initiation.
