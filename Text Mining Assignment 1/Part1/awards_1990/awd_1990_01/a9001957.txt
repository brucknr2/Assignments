Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study global invariants on                
              strictly pseudoconvex manifolds that arise as renormalized Chern               
              classes for complete Kaehler metrics.  He will continue his study              
              of pseudodifferential operator calculi adapted to the study of                 
              degenerate operators similiar to the Bergman-Laplace operator.  A              
              goal will be to obtain index formulae relating the renormalized                
              Chern numbers to "analytic" indices for degenerate elliptic                    
              complexes.  And he will continue an investigation of the problem               
              of embedding three dimensional CR-manifolds.                                   
                  For many years mathematicians have studied the behavior of                 
              certain differential operators on hypersurfaces which extend off               
              to infinity.  This study has its origins in the calculus of                    
              Newton.  In this project the principal investigator will analyze               
              operators which have large variations over very large domains                  
              "near" infinity.  In the past, only progress on operators which                
              have small local variations was made.
