Abstract    :
              This investigation, by one of the leaders in the field of cosmo-               
              logical modeling, combines two approaches to the basic problem of              
              understanding the origin of large-scale structure in our uni-                  
              verse.  The first approach is to work out the consequences of                  
              theoretical models using N-body simulations with far greater                   
              dynamic range than any previously performed, spanning at least                 
              7.5 orders of magnitude in mass and 3 in distance.  With more                  
              than 100 times as many particles as nearly all previous cosmolog-              
              ical simulations, this project is expected to yield much improved              
              tests of the inflationary universe paradigm with dark matter and               
              biased galaxy formation.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The second approach will investigate the theoretical implications              
              of large-scale deviations from uniform Hubble expansion.  A newly              
              developed technique will be applied to galaxy redshift-distance                
              samples to reconstruct the three-dimensional potential, velocity,              
              and mass density fields.  Possible systematic errors will be                   
              closely investigated with the goal of deriving more accurate                   
              relative galaxy distances.
