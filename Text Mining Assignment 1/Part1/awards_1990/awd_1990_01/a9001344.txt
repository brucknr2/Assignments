Abstract    :
                   Professor Casazza will conduct research on several problems               
              in the theory of Banach spaces.  They involve (i) uniqueness of                
              unconditional and symmetric structures in finite dimensional                   
              spaces, (ii) various forms of the Approximation Property, and                  
              (iii) the existence of prime Banach spaces.                                    
                   This award will support research in the geometry of Banach                
              spaces.  In finite dimensions, all vector spaces are essentially               
              the same.  But in the infinite dimensional situation primarily of              
              interest here, this is far from the case.  Banach spaces are                   
              infinite dimensional spaces with the additional structure                      
              introduced by varying notions of distance between points in the                
              space.  Such spaces have wide application in mathematics, both                 
              pure and applied.
