Abstract    :
                   Professor Gordon will continue to investigate problems in                 
              the topology of low-dimensional manifolds, especially those                    
              related to knot theory.  A particular topic that will receive                  
              attention is Dehn surgery on knots and links, a construction that              
              is relevant to many fundamental questions concerning the                       
              structure of 3-dimensional manifolds.                                          
                   The structure of three-dimensional manifolds, very natural                
              geometric objects of the same dimension as the space in which we               
              live, remains an important and surprisingly mysterious subject                 
              for mathematical investigation.
