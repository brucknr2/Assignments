Abstract    :
              This research program is being supported by the Organic                        
              Synthesis Program.  Aspects of the chemistry of compounds                      
              containing sulphur, selenium and tellurium will be pursued                     
              which have the potential to impact on a diverse number of areas                
              such as organic metals and optical sensors.                                    
                                                                                             
              The investigation in organochalcogen chemistry will emphasize                  
              the following areas:                                                           
                                                                                             
              l.  Organosulfur Chemistry                                                     
                                                                                             
              The chemistry of little explored types of thiocarbonyl                         
              compounds will be studied (e.g., thioquinones,                                 
              thionoanhydrides).  Other sulfur heterocycles which are                        
              potential pi donors (e.g., tetrathiafulvalene derivatives,                     
              polythiophenes, etc.) or LB film candidates will also be                       
              objects of investigation.                                                      
                                                                                             
              2.  Organoselenium Chemistry                                                   
                                                                                             
              Attention will be focussed on new organoselenium reagents, new                 
              selenium-containing pi donors, and selenocarbonyl derivatives.                 
                                                                                             
              3.  Organotellurium Chemistry                                                  
                                                                                             
              New tellurium-containing TTF and vinylogous TTF derivatives                    
              will be synthesized.  Attempts will be made to synthesize                      
              tellurium analogs of the well known 1,2,3-thiadiazoles.  The                   
              chemistry of new tellurium-containing functional groups will be                
              investigated.
