Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Paul               
              Fons of the University of Illinois to conduct collaborative                    
              research for 12 months with Dr. Teruaki Motooka of the University              
              of Tsukuba, Japan.  They will investigate the basic mechanisms of              
              solid-phase epitaxy of amorphous silicon on crystalline silicon                
              and the physics of silica/silicon interfaces.                                  
                                                                                             
              Semiconductor processing technologies are becoming increasing                  
              dependent on a detailed understanding of non-equilibrium solid-                
              phase interfaces and growth mechanisms.  This study will attempt               
              to characterize interfacial properties using Raman spectroscopy,               
              time-resolved ellipsometry, and electrical measurements.                       
              Interfacial structure will be modeled using both Molecular-Orbital             
              and Molecular Dynamics calculations.  Dr. Motooka's extensive                  
              experience with the theoretical analysis of interface structure                
              and proficiency in the interpretation of related experimental data             
              should complement and focus Dr. Fon's broad background in                      
              metallurgy, solid-state physics, solid-state devices, and computer             
              simulations.
