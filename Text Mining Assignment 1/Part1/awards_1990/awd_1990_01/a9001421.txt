Abstract    :
                   The research in mathematical statistics is divided into                   
              three parts: testing for overdispersion in discrete                            
              distributions, testing that a sample comes from a normal                       
              distribution rather than a finite mixture of normal                            
              distributions, and semi-parametric estimation of a mixed normal                
              density. A new test will be constructed for the presence of a                  
              mixture.  Also a new test and diagnostic for the number of                     
              components in a mixture will be derived. This will be achieved by              
              exploiting the geometry of ratios of mixed and unmixed densities.              
              A further goal is to estimate the mixed normal density using an                
              approach in which a smoothing parameter is selected via cross-                 
              validation.
