Abstract    :
                   Professor Radin will continue his research on the question                
              of why certain types of matter are in an ordered state at low                  
              temperature.  Recent results have shown that generically,                      
              perfect (crystalline) order at zero temperature is not to be                   
              expected.  Radin's research will involve nonperiodic tilings and               
              uniquely ergodic symbolic dynamical systems to determine the                   
              range of disorder that can be produced at zero and low                         
              temperature.
