Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This is a project to support attendance by approximately twenty                
              five graduate students at the Fifth Distributed Memory Computing               
              Conference in Charleston, South Carolina on April 9.12, 1990.                  
              Priority is given to students presenting papers in the student                 
              paper competition and to women and minority students.  The                     
              conference provides a forum for researchers in the field of                    
              distributed memory computing to present results and exchange                   
              ideas and information.  It is a continuation of the Hypercube                  
              Concurrent Computers and Applications conference series.//
