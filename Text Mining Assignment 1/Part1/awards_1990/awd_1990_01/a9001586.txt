Abstract    :
              In this study, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is used in                 
              conjunction with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to monitor                   
              the surfaces of platinum single crystals and model graphite-                   
              supported platinum catalysts following a variety of                            
              treatments, including use of the samples as catalysts for                      
              cyclohexene aromatization.  Several crystal planes are                         
              studied, including some with low and some with high Miller                     
              indices.  Single-crystal studies are compared with model                       
              catalyst studies to ascertain which features of the STM scans                  
              are relevant to catalytic performance.                                         
                                                                                             
              This is essentially a baseline study to establish reliability                  
              guidelines for application of STM in catalysis research.  In                   
              principle, this relatively new technique has great potential                   
              to reveal surface features in reacting systems heretofore                      
              impossible to detect.
