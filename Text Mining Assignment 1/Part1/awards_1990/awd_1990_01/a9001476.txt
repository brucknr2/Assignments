              will focus on three research areas that involve                                
              theoretical interpretation and guidance of the                                 
              experimental programs.  The three research areas                               
              are:  (1) nuclear shapes, (2) the source of nuclear                            
              collectivity, and (3) dynamic properties.  The                                 
              first area relates to the influence that specific                              
              nucleon orbitals have on the shape of the nucleus,                             
              the second to the role of the neutron. proton                                  
              interaction in the onset of collective motion in                               
              the nucleus, and the third to transitions from a                               
              specific region of stability involving rotational                              
              motion to another region.  The key to this program                             
              is the effective interaction between the experimental                          
              and the theoretical approaches to the understanding                            
              of these research areas.
