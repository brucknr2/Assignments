Abstract    :
              Dr. Daryl R. Sauer has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                    
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Sauer's doctoral degree was from                 
              the University of South Florida under the supervision of                       
              Professor Stewart Schneller.  Dr. Sauer intends to continue                    
              research at Ohio State University under the sponsorship of                     
              Professor Leo Paquette.  Dr. Sauer's area of postdoctoral                      
              training and research will be the design and synthesis of                      
              architecturally novel compounds of theoretical interest,                       
              development of new synthetic methodology, and the synthesis of                 
              natural and unnatural molecules which possess biological                       
              activity.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.Ds and attract them into                    
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
