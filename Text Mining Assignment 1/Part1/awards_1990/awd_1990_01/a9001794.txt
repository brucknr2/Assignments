Abstract    :
                   This research involves the quantum field theory of fermions               
              on the Poincare disk and the hard hexagon model - a lattice gas                
              model in statistical mechanics.  The research on the quantum                   
              theory of fermions will involve expressing the Schwinger                       
              functions in terms of certain nonlinear deformation equations.                 
              These equations will then be analyzed both in the Euclidean limit              
              and in the conformal field theory limit.  An important aspect of               
              this work is the extension of the existing theory to the                       
              noneuclidean setting which may lay the groundwork for extensions               
              to Riemann surfaces of a more general type.  The research on the               
              hard hexagon model will involve derivations of differential                    
              equations for the partition function and density functions.  An                
              attempt will be made to extend these equations to the hard square              
              lattice gas, a model that is 'not solvable' by present                         
              techniques.                                                                    
                   This research is in the general area of theoretical physics               
              and deals with isomonodromy deformations and applications to                   
              conformal field theory, statistical mechanics, and scattering                  
              theory.
