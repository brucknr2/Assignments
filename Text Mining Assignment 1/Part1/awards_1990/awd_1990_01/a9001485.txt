Abstract    :
              The Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr.                 
              Peter A. Jacobi of the Department of Chemistry at Wesleyan                     
              University by means of an Accomplishment Based Renewal award.                  
              He will continue to develop methodology that leads to the                      
              preparation of ring-containing organic molecules.  The specific                
              process, known as bis-heteroannulation, affords fused-ring                     
              furans, prepared with complete regiochemical control.                          
                                                                                             
              The key element in Dr. Jacobi's approach involves the                          
              intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction between an oxazole and an                  
              acetylene.  In addition to the bis-heteroannulation work,                      
              tandem sigmatropic rearrangements will be used for the                         
              tranformation of acetylenic alcohols or enones into                            
              methylenecyclopentanones or phenols.  Syntheses of a number of                 
              naturally occuring phenols and sesquiterpenes will illustrate                  
              the usefulness of the methodology.
