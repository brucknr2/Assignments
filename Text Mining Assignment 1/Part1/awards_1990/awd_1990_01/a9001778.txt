Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Columbia University hosts two Theory Days annually, one in the spring          
              and one in the fall.  Each theory day consists of four one-hour                
              invited talks on current research results.  In addition, there is              
              ample time for questions and informal discussions on a range of                
              theoretical topics.  Typically 100-150 people attend.  This project            
              supports four theory days, beginning with the Spring 1990 theory day.
