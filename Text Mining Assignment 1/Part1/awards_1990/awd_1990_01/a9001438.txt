Abstract    :
              A detailed study of intra- and intermolecular interactions in                  
              more complicated structures -- DNA, polypetides and small                      
              proteins, complex natureal products, polymetallic species and                  
              enzyme mimics requires less routine 1D NMR experiments, pulse                  
              sequences for various 2D NMR experiemtns, solvent supression,                  
              and variable temperature experiments.  Multinuclear high field                 
              NMRs are ideally suited for use in these more complicated                      
              structures.  The results from these NMR studies are useful in                  
              areas, such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.                            
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                   
              will help the Department of Chemsitry at the University of                     
              Illinois acquire 400 MHz NMR spectrometer.  The 400 MHz NMR                    
              spectrometer will be used in research investigations in the
