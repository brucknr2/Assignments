Abstract    :
                   This proposal provides funds for a three year program                     
              leading to the implementation of an enhanced incoherent scatter                
              data acquisition system at the Millstone Hill I.S. Radar                       
              Facility.  Some funding has been previously provided by the NSF                
              for the construction of a state-of-the-art data acquisition                    
              system known as MIDAS (Millstone Ionospheric Data Acquisition                  
              System).  Hardware for a second such system has been provided by               
              the Office of Naval Research (ONR).  This proposal calls for                   
              constructing a second MIDAS systems.***//
