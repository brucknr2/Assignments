Abstract    :
                   Work to be done on this project falls into two related                    
              classes.  The first, infinite dimensional nonlinear programming                
              problems, concerns the modeling of optimal control problems for                
              partial differential equations, functional differential equations              
              and other equations as infinite dimensional nonlinear programming              
              problems.  Goals include developing necessary conditions for the               
              existence of minima and for the convergence of sequences of                    
              suboptimal elements.                                                           
                   The second theme, optimal control theory of partial                       
              differential and functional differential equations concerns                    
              application of results from the first part to problems such as                 
              optimal deformation problems - especially in the presence of                   
              obstacles.  The results are likely to include versions of                      
              Pontryagin's maximum principle, constancy and vanishing of the                 
              Hamiltonian and convergence estimates.                                         
                   Attention will also be given to boundary control questions,               
              where results (compared to distributed parameter systems) are                  
              sparse.  Application to specific equations will be made.
