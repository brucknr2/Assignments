Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study rods, shells and solid              
              bodies composed of various elastic, plastic and viscous materials              
              using geometrically exact theories for nonlinear constitutive                  
              equations, in order to treat new nonlinear effects, thresholds                 
              and instabilities.  He will study also dissipative mechanisms in               
              solid materials such as shock waves and contact discontinuities.               
                   Two-and three-dimensional solid bodies are complicated                    
              objects to study when they are composed of elastic or plastic                  
              material.  The reason is that such objects often behave counter-               
              intuitively when subjected to loading or stress.  In order to                  
              help understand these materials and predict their responses to                 
              applied forces it is important to have mathematical models that                
              are realistic and at the same time amenable to solution.  This                 
              proposal will formulate several such models and attempt to find                
              meaningful solutions.
