Abstract    :
              This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                 
              Chemistry Program will enable twenty U.S. graduate students to                 
              attend the XIV International Conference on Organometallic                      
              Chemistry in Detroit, Michigan, August 19-24, 1990. The                        
              conference is expected to attract more than 500 scientists with                
              demonstrated research interests in organometallic chemistry and                
              particularly its applications in new materials. The primary                    
              goals of the 1990 meeeting are to provide opportunities for                    
              full participation both to young researchers in the United                     
              States and to scientists from less-developed nations, to                       
              stimulate interaction between academic and industrial chemists                 
              in the U.S., and to provide a forum for the latest developments                
              in the broad field of organometallic chemistry.
