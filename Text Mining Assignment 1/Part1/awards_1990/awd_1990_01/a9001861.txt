Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study the existence of                    
              compact leaves in contact foliations of compact contact                        
              manifolds.  The existence of these foliations was conjectured by               
              Weinstein.  Several special cases have been solved by this                     
              investigator and by other mathematicians.  Lickorish surgical                  
              techniques will be used to investigate the three-dimensional                   
              version of the problem.  Okumura's theory will be applied to the               
              problem in the case of hypersurfaces with contact types in                     
              Kaehler manifolds.  Diffeomorphism groups will also be studied.                
                  "Manifolds" are generalized surfaces.  These may be filled                 
              with collections of lower dimensional "leaves."  Such collections              
              of leaves are called "foliations."  The principal investigator                 
              will study leaves which do not wrap on continuously but actually               
              close up.  These are called in the literature, "compact leaves."               
              Such are particularly important in applications to other sciences              
              in that they represent, in a general sense, behavior which                     
              repeats indefinitely.
