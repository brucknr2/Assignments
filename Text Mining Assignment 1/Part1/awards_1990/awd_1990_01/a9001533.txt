Abstract    :
                   The phylogenetic relationships among the orders of otophysan               
                                                                                            
              fishes and the families of catfishes will be investigated using                
              nucleotide sequence variation of ribosomal RNA.  Ribosomal RNA                 
              sequences will be obtained using a primer-extension sequencing                 
              method applied directly to RNA samples isolated from tissue                    
              samples.  Statistical tests will be applied to these data to                   
              resolve alternative hypotheses previously generated from                       
              morphological data.  The evolutionary events underlying the                    
              multiple derivations of complex morphological systems such as the              
                                                                                             
              elastic spring apparatus and palatine-maxillary mechanism will be              
                                                                                             
              evaluated in the context of a molecular phylogeny.  The                        
              resulting molecular phylogenies will also be used to test                      
              predictions of the vicariance and dispersalist models of                       
              vertebrate radiation and to reevaluate major trends of                         
              morphological evolution among otophysan fishes.  The phylogenetic              
                                                                                             
              information contained in different parts of the ribosome will be               
                                                                                             
              examined to identify a general range of divergence times over                  
                                                                                             
              which ribosomal sequence variation is likely to be informative                 
                                                                                             
              for teleost fishes.
