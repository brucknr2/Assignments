Abstract    :
              Acquiring a transmission electron microscope would greatly                     
              strengthen research opportunities in cell, molecular, and                      
              developmental biology at Wright State University.  Students                    
              taking our research-oriented course in electron microscopy or                  
              doing a research project using electron microscopy will have the               
                                                                                             
              opportunity to use modern equipment that is flexible, reliable,                
              and comparable to facilities available in commercial laboratories              
                                                                                             
              or major research institutions nationwide.  Specific research                  
              opportunities for undergraduates include the projects outlined in              
                                                                                             
              this proposal:  (1) the influence of gravity on plant growth and               
                                                                                             
              development, (2) cuticular and gut ultrastructure of Sarcoptes                 
              scabiei from susceptible and resistant hosts, (3) growth and                   
              differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes, (4) morphological                  
              adaptation of avian osmoregulatory organs to changing                          
              physiological demands, and (5) secretion of gonadotropin                       
              releasing hormone in the central nervous system.
