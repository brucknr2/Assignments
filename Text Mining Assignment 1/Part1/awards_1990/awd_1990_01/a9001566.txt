Abstract    :
              Dr. Vincent Rotello has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                   
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Rotello's doctoral degree was                    
              from Yale University under the supervision of Professor Harry                  
              Wasserman.  Dr. Rotello intends to continue research at the                    
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of                 
              Professor Julius Rebek.  Dr. Rotello's area of postdoctoral                    
              research and training will be molecular recognition and                        
              macromolecular catalysis.  He will design molecular cleft hosts                
              bound to flexible peptide fragments to maximize host-guest                     
              binding.  These systems will serve as models for                               
              enzyme-substrate and antibody-hapten recognition.                              
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of recent Ph.D's and attract them into                
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
