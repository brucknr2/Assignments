Abstract    :
                   Research focuses on development of models for performance                 
              evaluation of the following types of queueing systems:  (i)                    
              polling systems, where a central computer polls terminals that                 
              share a single transmission channel (such as a token ring LAN) and             
              (ii)  database systems, where records are inserted into and deleted            
              from file structures called buckets.  The study will include both              
              the development of the underlying mathematical theory of queues                
              (such as the fundamental M/G/1 model, vacation models, cyclic-                 
              service models and multiserver systems with ordered hunt) and the              
              practical application to the performance analysis for real systems.
