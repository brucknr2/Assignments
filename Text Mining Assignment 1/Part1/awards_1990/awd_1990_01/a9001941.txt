Abstract    :
                   (1) The trace formula of J. Arthur and A. Selberg (for the                
              trace of the action of a Hecke correspondence on the L2                        
              cohomology of a Hermitian locally symmetric space) will be                     
              reproved and interpreted in terms of the Lefschetz fixed point                 
              theorem.  This will involve a new evaluation of the local                      
              contribution to the Lefschetz number at a fixed point and the                  
              construction of a new cohomology theory ("weighted cohomology")                
              on the reductive Borel-Serre compactification of X.  Applications              
              will be made to the computation of characters of discrete series               
              representations, the cohomology of discrete groups, and the Hodge              
              (p,q) decomposition of the L2 cohomology.  (2) Chern numbers of                
              singular complex algebraic varieties will be defined by lifting                
              Chern classes to intersection cohomology.  The invariance                      
              properties of these new Chern numbers will be investigated.
