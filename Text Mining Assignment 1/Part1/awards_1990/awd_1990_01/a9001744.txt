Abstract    :
              Research on a wide variety of phenomenological and theoretical                 
              topics in particle physics will be carried out. Two theoretical                
              projects evaluating the cross-sections fortriple weak gauge                    
              boson and S- and P-state (and even D-state)quarkonium                          
              production are planned.  Several more phenomenological                         
              calculations involving psi and chi production invarious                        
              collider settings are envisaged.  Further work on tests of the                 
              hadronic (especially the gluonic) structure functions of the                   
              photon in ep collisions will also be undertaken, as will                       
              projects at the interface of particle physics with astrophysics                
              and cosmic ray physics.  Much of the work to be carried out is                 
              meant to further the extremely crucial contact between                         
              theoretical and experimental elementary particle physics.
