Abstract    :
              Experimental studies at the organ and single vessel level                      
              suggest that hemodynamic factors play a role in                                
              angiogenesis; however, the proposed factors have not been                      
              proven to work in microvascular networks.  This proposal                       
              focuses on the hypothesis that the development of mature                       
              microvascular network from the primitive neonatal vascular                     
              plexus (the process of network remodeling) is the result                       
              of gradual adaptation of vessels to local mechanical                           
              forces, such as, shear stress exerted by blood flow on the                     
              vessel wall and intravascular pressure.  To test the                           
              hypothesis in cerebral tissue, experiments will be                             
              performed to study changes in intracortical and pial                           
              microvascular architecture and vascular dimensions in two                      
              to five week old rats, and to correlate some of these                          
              changes with wall shear stress, intravascular pressure and                     
              other hemodynamic variables.  Subsequently, a mathematical                     
              model will be developed to test whether the architecture                       
              of intracortical microvascular networks can be predicted                       
              from the microvascular architecture of the neonate and                         
              certain properties of vascular adaptation learned from the                     
              experiments.  These studies will provide important new                         
              information on the role of hemodynamic factors in the                          
              development of the cerebral microvascular bed which may                        
              influence growth and repair of cerebral tissue.
