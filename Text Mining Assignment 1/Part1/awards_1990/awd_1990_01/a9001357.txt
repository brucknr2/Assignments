Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic                  
              geometry of Professor Alice Silverberg of The Ohio State                       
              University. Dr. Silverberg's project is to study arithmetic                    
              quotients of bounded symmetric domains and their points, and                   
              especially certain special group representations associated to                 
              such points.                                                                   
                   This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic                     
              geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic                  
              geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,                       
              algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the                
              plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number                    
              theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as                    
              divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects,               
              seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from                
              the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual                 
              influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic                       
              algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern                      
              mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own              
              borders.
