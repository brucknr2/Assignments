Abstract    :
              This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis                         
              Chemistry Program.  Dr. Hendrickson is developing a computer                   
              based system to aid in the complicated process of synthesizing                 
              the variety of structures that are found in nature or the new                  
              molecules needed to meet the demands of our society.  The                      
              computer provides an important tool in making choices among the                
              myriad possible routes to synthesize new structures in an                      
              efficient and economic manner.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The first version of a computer program (SYNGEN) was developed                 
              which creates the shortest synthesis routes of construction                    
              reactions only by a protocol based on convergent assembly of                   
              the target molecule from real starting materials in a catalog.                 
              The program proceeds without resort to a database library of                   
              reactions and without operator intervention.  The program will                 
              be developed into a fully practical tool for organic chemists,                 
              refining the presentation to present the best routes foremost                  
              and to offer literature precedents on command.  Ancillary                      
              developments will include several new strategies for synthesis                 
              design and expanded capabilities into special chemistry.  The                  
              reaction and starting material bases available for synthesis                   
              will be organized and used to assess the nature of existing                    
              syntheses in the literature to gain more insight into the logic                
              of design strategies in actual use.
