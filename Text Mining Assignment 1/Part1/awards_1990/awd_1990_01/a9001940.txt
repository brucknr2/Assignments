Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This phase 2 SBIR proposal is concerned with a new device which                
              utilizes a technique developed for an ink-jet writing machine.                 
              This device should allow the delivery of very small amounts of                 
              fluid in the close proximity of a cell.  Cells communicate with                
              each other by secreting chemical messengers, such as hormones and              
              neurotransmitters and it would be important, both for theoretical              
              and practical purposes, to be able to replicate this process.                  
              This device promises to do precisely that.  If the design is                   
              successfully implemented it will be possible to deliver minute                 
              amounts of chemicals known or suspected to be cellular                         
              messengers, directly onto the surface of cells.  Also, it will be              
              possible to deliver drugs suspected to interfere with cellular                 
              communications.  For this reason the device could become an                    
              important tool in the pharmaceutical industry.
