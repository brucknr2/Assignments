Abstract    :
              This proposal describes a possible method for transforming                     
              Drosophila embryos by injecting them with defined oligonucleotides.            
              If the nucleotide sequences substitute for the normal gene,                    
              mutation will be produced. Putative mutations will be confirmed by             
              breeding tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnoses. This             
              is a high risk effort with a large payoff if successful. If it                 
              works at a reasonable rate, the transformation of Drosophila will              
              be greatly simplified if not become routine.
