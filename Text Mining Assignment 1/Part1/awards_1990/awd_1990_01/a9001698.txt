Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research consists of an experimental and theoretical                      
              investigation of grain growth in polycrystalline films on single               
              crystal substrates.  Reflected high energy and transmission                    
              electron diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and thin               
              film X-ray texture analysis are employed to characterize the film              
              grain size and orientation.  Metal-on-metal, metal-on-mica, and                
              metal-on-alkali halide model systems are the principal materials               
              under study.  Experimental results on grain growth are compared                
              to predictions from computer simulations and analytical theories.              
              A primary goal is to determine the film/substrate interface                    
              energy as a function of relative film/substrate orientation by                 
              experimental methods and compare these results with atomistic                  
              computer simulations.
