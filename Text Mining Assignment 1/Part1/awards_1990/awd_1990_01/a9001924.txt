Abstract    :
                   The Fourteenth Symposium on Real Analysis will be                         
              held from June 20 to June 23, 1990 at California State                         
              University, San Bernardino.  This is the fourteenth in a series                
              of symposia that have provided real analysts from North America,               
              Europe, Africa, Australia, and Asia the opportunity to meet, to                
              hear, and to discuss mathematics.  A list of the invited speakers              
              will include Jack Brown, Andrew Bruckner, Jack Ceder, Alexander                
              Kechris, and David Preiss.  Written versions of all the                        
              presentations will appear in the Conference Proceedings Section                
              of the following volume of the Real Analysis Exchange.
