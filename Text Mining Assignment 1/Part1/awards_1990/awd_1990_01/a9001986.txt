Abstract    :
                   The source of ore fluids and their interactions with host                 
              rocks are of considerable concern in the understanding of the                  
              Mississippi Valley-type of Lead-Zinc deposits.  In southeast                   
              Missouri there is a strong possibility that multiple basinal                   
              fluids were involved and indicate a more complex origin for                    
              sulfide orebodies in the region than previously modeled.  This                 
              project will utilize sulfur isotope variations throughout the                  
              paragenetic sequence of sulfide deposition for a number of mines               
              in the Viburnum Trend of the Southeast Missouri Lead-Zinc                      
              district.  Results should clarify the role of successive pulses                
              of ore-forming fluids and their interaction with host rocks.
