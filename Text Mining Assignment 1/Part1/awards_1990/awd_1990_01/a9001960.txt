Abstract    :
                   This study examines the following problems, (1) cumulus-                  
              stratocumulus transition in the oceanic boundary layer for FIRE                
              and ASTEX, (2) land surface interaction for FIFE, and (3)                      
              radiative-convective coupling in the boundary layer.                           
                   This study is important because it will help us to improve                
              our conceptual framework for future experiments such as                        
              TOGA/COARE; and to develop better parametric models for the                    
              convective boundary layer in climate and forecast models.
