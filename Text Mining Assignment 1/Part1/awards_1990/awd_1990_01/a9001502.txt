Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                 The research will be in three area: 1) density functional                  
              theory, 2) surface physics, 3) quantum diffusion.  The main                    
              emphasis in the first area will be density functional theory for               
              high-temperature superconductors.  Work in surface physics                     
              includes atom-surface scattering, recoilless scattering for very               
              heavy atoms, inelastic scattering involving soft phonon                        
              production, and plasmons in small structures.  The research in                 
              quantum diffusion includes studying hydrogen in or on vibrating                
              solids and the analysis of quantum diffusion in a static                       
              disordered potential.
