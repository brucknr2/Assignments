Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with research on the valuation                  
              theory of division algebras finite-dimensional over their                      
              centers. A particular focus is the further study of Dubrovin                   
              valuation rings.                                                               
                   A ring is an algebraic object having an addition and a                    
              multiplication defined on it. Rings occur naturally in many                    
              different settings in mathematics. This project is concerned with              
              an important class of rings called division algebras.
