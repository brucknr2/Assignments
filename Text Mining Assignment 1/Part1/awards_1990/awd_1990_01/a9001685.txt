Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves a study of recovery,                                     
              reconstruction and mitigation activities in                                    
              Charleston, South Carolina in the aftermath of                                 
              Hurricane Hugo.  The research will have three                                  
              primary goals. First, to examine                                               
              reconstruction policies in relationship to                                     
              their impact upon mitigation.  Second, to                                      
              analyze the influence of hazard reduction                                      
              activities in one area (seismic hazards) upon                                  
              the impact and recovery from a related, though                                 
              different, hazard.  Third, to study the effect                                 
              of place specific sense of community upon the                                  
              reconstruction and mitigation processes.  Data                                 
              sources will include interviews with                                           
              officials, a survey of households, and                                         
              relevant documents and reports.
