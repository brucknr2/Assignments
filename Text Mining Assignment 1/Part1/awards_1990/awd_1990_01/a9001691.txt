Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project examines transient liquid phase bonding with the aim              
              of modeling this joining process and determining the effects of                
              processing variables.  The approach is aimed at predicting those               
              alloy systems that respond to transient liquid phase bonding and               
              quantifying important features of the process, such as the                     
              solidification kinetics, effects of solid solubility and phase                 
              equilibria, influence of surface tensions, generic design of                   
              interlayers, etc.  Out of this research a clear rationale for                  
              design of interlayers based on thermodynamic and transport                     
              properties of the materials' systems should evolve.  Potential                 
              future applications include transient liquid phase bonding of                  
              electronic packaging, advanced metal matrix composites, ceramic-               
              to-metal bonding, and reactive metal joining.
