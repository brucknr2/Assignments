Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Using the method of induced hyperbolicity developed earlier               
              by the principal investigator, families of nonlinear dynamical                 
              systems will be studied.  Of particular interest will be their                 
              stochastic behavior.  One-parameter families of diffeomorphisms                
              close to the unstable manifold of the Feigenbaum fixed point will              
              be inspected.  And Sullivan's approach will be used to                         
              investigate when topological conjugacy implies quasiconformal                  
              conjugacy for maps with absolutely continuous invariant measures.              
                   An invariant measure of a dynamical system is positive on                 
              invariant sets of the system which attract or repel.  The                      
              principal investigator will study such systems which are close in              
              some parameter space to the Feigenbaum limit.  This limit of                   
              period-doubling bifurcations has raised intense interest from                  
              investigators in a wide variety of physical and biological                     
              sciences.  Just past this limit lies the onset of chaos.
