Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project provides one year of partial subsidy for the Mid-                 
              America Drosophila Stock Center.  Drosophila, or "fruit flies,"                
              are essential experimental animals which are used extensively in               
              genetics research.  The Mid-America Center maintains 4,061 genetic             
              strains of the most important fruit-fly species, Drosophila                    
              melanogaster, which are distributed to institutions around the                 
              world for research and teaching purposes.  From 1985 to 1989, over             
              12,000 requests for flies were received and nearly 59,000 stocks               
              were mailed to all 50 states and over 50 foreign countries.  These             
              stocks include basic mutants as well as complex mutant combinations            
              and chromosome rearrangements.  It is essential that such stocks               
              be maintained because they represent many man-years of genetic                 
              research and are difficult, and in some cases impossible, to re-               
              isolate or re-synthesize.  In addition, it is much too expensive               
              for each researcher utilizing Drosophila to maintain the full range            
              of stocks it envisions it will need.  It is certain that                       
              curtailment of the activities of the Mid-America Center would                  
              seriously affect genetics research worldwide.
