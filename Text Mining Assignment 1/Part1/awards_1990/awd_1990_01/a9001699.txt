Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for renovation of the                           
              cineradiographic instrumentation in the Museum of Comparative                  
              Zoology.  Established in 1974 with funds from the National Science             
              Foundation and with construction provided by Harvard University,               
              the cineradiographic facility is a unique research resource that               
              is extensively used in experimental investigations of biomechanics,            
              locomotion, feeding and respiration in representatives of every                
              vertebrate class.  The apparatus, which simultaneously provides                
              cinefluorographic imagery and permanent (16 mm) film records at                
              speed of 50 - 200 frames/second, is in urgent need of engineering              
              overhaul and replacement of parts. Current and anticipated future              
              use of this facility, which is essential to the future development             
              of organismal biology, depends upon upgrading the equipment.
