Abstract    :
              Dr. Silvia Lopez has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Lopez's doctoral degree was from                  
              Cornell University under the supervision of Professor Hector                   
              Abruna.  Dr. Lopez intends to continue research at the                         
              University of Minnesota under the sponsorship of Professor                     
              Henry S. White.  Dr. Lopez's area of postdoctoral research will                
              be studies of the dynamics of electrocrystallization of low                    
              dimensional solids.  By carefully controlling electrode                        
              potentials, Dr. Lopez will be able to monitor crystallization                  
              of specific phases by scanning tunneling microscopy.                           
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
