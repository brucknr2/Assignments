Abstract    :
                  This research will apply asymptotic approximation techniques               
              in the study of the dynamics of molecular systems in the so-                   
              called Born-Oppenheimer limit.  In particular, the principal                   
              investigator will consider scattering problems, the effects of                 
              electron energy level crossing, avoided crossings and the effects              
              of oscillating electromagnetic fields.  This will be accomplished              
              using analytical and numerical methods.                                        
                   Most molecules consist of complicated systems of electrons                
              whose behavior determines the macroscopic (or bulk) properties of              
              materials.  It is especially important to have mathematical                    
              models of these electron systems, since understanding the                      
              behavior of the electrons enables us to understand the                         
              conductivity of a material, for example.  In this proposal the                 
              principal investigator will use analytical and numerical methods               
              to study how electrons behave in crossing from one energy level                
              to another.
