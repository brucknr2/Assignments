Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplemental support to enable                         
              Dr. Frederick Bingham of Scripps Institute of Oceanography to                  
              conduct collaborative research for 12 months with                              
              Dr. Yoshiaki Toba of Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.  They                 
              will investigate interannual changes in the heat content of                    
              the western North Pacific Ocean, and the relationship of                       
              those changes to variability in the Kuroshio Current system.                   
                                                                                             
              The oceans store heat from and release heat to the atmosphere                  
              depending on the season.  With increasing concern about                        
              changes in the Earth's climate, it is critical to understand                   
              the mechanisms of heat transfer between the ocean and                          
              atmosphere.  Professor Toba's research group has been studying                 
              the dynamics of air-sea interactions in the western North                      
              Pacific for many years and their extensive, long-term data                     
              sets will enable Dr. Bingham to quantitatively assess                          
              interannual variability in the heat content within that                        
              complex oceanographic region.
