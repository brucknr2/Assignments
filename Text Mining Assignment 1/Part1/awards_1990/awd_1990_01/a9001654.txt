Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for research on the                        
              development of an instrument that can be used to measure                       
              the velocity of water flowing in subsurface aquifers.  The                     
              basis of instrument operation is the generation and                            
              observation of a migrating thermal plume in the vicinity                       
              of the heated probe.  The proposed instrument will be                          
              equipped to sense the motion of groundwater by monitoring                      
              the discharge of heat from the isothermally heated                             
              cylinder to the surrounding soil as a function of location                     
              on the probe surface.  Unlike presently available devices,                     
              groundwater flow is directed around rather than through                        
              the probe.  This provides the instrument with the                              
              advantage of component isolation from the groundwater                          
              environment.  Hence, the probe is expected to maintain                         
              excellent long term stability (years).                                         
                                                                                             
              An accurate knowledge of groundwater movement is needed as                     
              greater pressures are exerted on our available groundwater                     
              resources.  The depletion and recharge of groundwater                          
              supplies as well as the migration of contaminant "plumes"                      
              through groundwater can only be predicted given a                              
              knowledge of groundwater flow characteristics.  This                           
              primarily entails a complete knowledge of groundwater flow                     
              speed and direction for the zone of interest.  This award                      
              was made in accord with criteria outlined in NSF 89-85,
