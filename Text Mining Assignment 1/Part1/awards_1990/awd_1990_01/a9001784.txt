Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with probabilistic and                         
              generational properties of finite groups. In particular the                    
              structure of a random permutation group will be investigated.                  
              These results will be applied to algorithmic questions                         
              concerning permutation groups. The principal investigator will                 
              also consider properties of finite quotients of affine                         
              buildings associated with p-adic simple groups. In addition,                   
              the relationships among certain generalized quadrangles and                    
              certain translation planes will be considered.                                 
                   A group is an algebraic object having a single operation.                 
              This work is concerned with determining the generators of a                    
              finite group from a probabilistic standpoint. These questions                  
              arise directly from desired applications in contemporary                       
              computer science.
