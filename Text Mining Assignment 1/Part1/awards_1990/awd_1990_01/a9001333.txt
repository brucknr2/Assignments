Abstract    :
              This REU site involves a twelve-week summer research program for               
              senior undergraduates.  Nine faculty will participate in the program,          
              with research interests in biotechnology electrochemistry, interfacial         
              phenomena, statistical thermodynamics, polymer characterization and            
              materials science.  The program will include a tutorial series on              
              statistics, computer programming and experimental methods for                  
              analysis.  A seminar series will use the resources in other                    
              departments  on campus and neighboring institutions as well as                 
              researchers from local industrial and public laboratories.  In this            
              manner, the collaborative possibilities in cross-disciplinary research         
              open to chemical engineers and the research opportunities which exist          
              outside the university will be made known to the student.  The program         
              will conclude with a day of public seminars, where the students will           
              present their research activity and accomplishments.
