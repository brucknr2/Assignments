Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research                            
              project between Dr. Leon Chua of the University of                             
              California, Berkeley, and Dr. Tamas Roska of the Hungarian                     
              Academy of Sciences' Computer and Automation Research                          
              Institute is to investigate mixed-mode nonlinear computing                     
              structures.  Efforts will include three areas of emphasis:                     
              1) determining the qualitative relationships between analog                    
              and digital realizations of canonical nonlinear information                    
              processing architectures; 2) simulating the quantitative                       
              problems of nonlinear programming circuits and cellular                        
              neural networks; and 3) furthering functional design of a                      
              mixed-mode nonlinear processing element to exploit analog                      
              dynamics and logical decisions.  Results are expected to                       
              extend nonlinear circuit theory and may lead to a better                       
              undertanding of the operational limits of existing                             
              digitally-realized networks and new nonlinear analog and                       
              mixed-mode computing.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This project in computer science fulfills the program                          
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                     
              combine complementary talents and pool research resources                      
              in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
