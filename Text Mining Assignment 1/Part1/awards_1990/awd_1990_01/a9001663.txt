Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will continue his important work on                 
              the partial differential equations that arise in various areas of              
              continuum mechanics.  In particular, he will apply advanced                    
              mathematical tools to study the general theory of multiphase                   
              thermomechanics as it relates to interfacial dynamics and                      
              phenomena involving melting and freezing.  He will also                        
              investigate some unusual partial differential equations that are               
              found in flows through porous media and in biological dispersal.               
              The work of the principal investigator concerns the development                
              and study of mathematical models that attempt to describe such                 
              complicated physical phenomena as the growth of crystals with                  
              facets and corners, the evolution of a melting-freezing wave, and              
              more generally the creation of ordered structures in media                     
              through the action of curved fronts that move through the media.               
              As an example, think of trying to describe quantitatively what                 
              happens if you draw a hot wire through a block of ice.  It is a                
              complicated process involving melting and re-freezing,  which is               
              difficult to study because the boundary between the melted and                 
              unmelted ice is so sensitive to the temperature of the wire and                
              other factors.
