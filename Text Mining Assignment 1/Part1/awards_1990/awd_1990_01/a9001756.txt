Abstract    :
              Appoaches to acquiring problem-solving knowledge have focused on               
              achieving general results with simple problem domains.  These                  
              domains have had small search spaces, few subgoal interactions,                
              and only Boolean constraints.  Real-world application domains                  
              have many subgoal interactions, large search spaces, and real-                 
              valued performance constraints as well as Boolean constraints.                 
              SteppingStone is a new general learning problem solver for                     
              solving difficult real-world problems.  SteppingStone solves                   
              these problems by decomposing them into simpler subproblems, and               
              then learning to deal with the interactions that arise between                 
              them.  An initial version of our approach demonstrates this in                 
              the classical tile-sliding domain.  This work will extend the                  
              system and demonstrate its capability in real-world problem-                   
              solving situations such as VLSI design and job-shop scheduling.                
              By experimenting with both classical problem-solving domains and               
              real-world aplications it will demonstrate that the problem                    
              solver is both powerful and general.
