Abstract    :
              This project submitted by the American Society of Human                        
              Genetics, provides partial support for the scientific program                  
              of the 8th International Congress of Human Genetics to be held                 
              in Washington, DC, October 6-11, 1991.  These Congresses,                      
              convened every five years since 1956, provide an excellent                     
              forum for the presentation of fundamental research results in                  
              human genetics to the international community of scholars in                   
              this rapidly advancing field.  The primary purpose of the                      
              Congress is to enhance the body of knowledge in human genetics                 
              through the exchange of information that will take place.  This                
              Congress comes at a most propitious time when important                        
              advances in basic molecular genetics are being incorporated                    
              into the practice of human genetics.  The obvious potential                    
              generated by such powerful analytical techniques as those                      
              employing recombinant DNA, DNA- and chromosome-mediated gene                   
              transfer, flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction, and                       
              homologous recombination indicate this to be a particularly                    
              opportune time for such as international meeting.  It should                   
              be noted that the extensive international collaboration in                     
              human genetics which presently exists will continue to develop                 
              as dictated by complementary expertise in different areas for                  
              the most economical and efficient use of limited scientific                    
              resources.
