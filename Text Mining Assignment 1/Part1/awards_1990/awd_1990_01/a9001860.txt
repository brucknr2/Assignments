Abstract    :
                   Research will be conducted to produce a coherent system for               
              the robust analysis of designed experiments.  Hypothesis tests                 
              and confidence intervals as well as estimators will be studied.                
              Mixed effects and random effects models are to be studied as well              
              as fixed effects models. Specifically, a new analysis of variance              
              table with three additional "mean squares" per line will be given              
              based on high-breakdown, high-efficientcy estimates of effects                 
              and of scale.  The new mean squares will provide information on                
              unusual aspects of the data. Also the robust scale problem will                
              be studied and robust methods for variance components will be                  
              given. Tests for significant effects in two to the power k                     
              designs without replication will be given.  Proposed interactive               
              dynamic graphics for designed experiments will be evaluated.
