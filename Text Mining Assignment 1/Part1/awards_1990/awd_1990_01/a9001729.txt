Abstract    :
                   The project of F. Connolly covers a variety of topics                     
              related to topological rigidity properties of crystallographic,                
              arithmetic, and negatively curved groups.  His investigations                  
              also include related questions about Nil-K-theory of such groups               
              as well as the study of groups which act freely and cocompactly                
              on the product of real n-space and an m-sphere.  This work is                  
              related to a number of famous open problems, e.g., the Borel                   
              conjecture, the Novikov conjecture, and it draws upon a broad                  
              range of techniques.
