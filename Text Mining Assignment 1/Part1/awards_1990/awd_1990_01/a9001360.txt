Abstract    :
              This award will allow the Principal Investigator to upgrade the                
              positioning and guidance system of the Southwest Missouri State                
              University (SMSU) Baker Observatory 0.4-m Cassegrain reflecting                
              telescope.  This telescope was one of the first instruments used               
              at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) and Cerro Tololo                      
              Interamerican Observatory (CTIO).  It was obtained from CTIO by                
              SMSU in 1983 on a long-term, renewable loan basis.  The telescope              
              was installed at Baker Observatory in 1984, and although the                   
              optical system is still quite satisfactory, the positioning and                
              guidance system is in need of modernization.  This award provides              
              funds to purchase a computer-controlled closed-loop stepping                   
              motor positioning system and a remote guiding system.  These will              
              allow rapid and accurate positioning and precise guiding of the                
              telescope.  This will permit efficient use with existing                       
              instrumentation, which consists of an automated-filter photometer              
              and a CCD imaging system.  The scientific programs to be carried               
              out with these instruments include high precision photoelectric                
              and CCD  camera photometry of variable stars, standard stars, and              
              bright galaxies.
