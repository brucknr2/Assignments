Abstract    :
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics" can              
              be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                          
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.                                                            
                   Professor Ratner is a world leader in ergodic theory.  She                
              will continue her work on the "rigidity" of unipotent subgroups                
              of connected Lie groups.  In particular, she will attempt to                   
              prove a conjecture of Raghunathan which states that every such                 
              subgroup is "algebraic".  Such a result would have important                   
              implications for the diverse fields of ergodic theory, geometry,               
              and number theory.
