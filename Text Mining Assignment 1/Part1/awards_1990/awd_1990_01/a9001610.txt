Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research program is part of the                                           
              initiative to collect perishable data                                          
              resulting from the 17 October 1989 Northern                                    
              California (Loma Prieta) earthquake.                                           
                                                                                             
              The objective is to obtain data on the                                         
              performance of five soil nailed walls in the                                   
              San Francisco Bay area during the Loma Prieta                                  
              earthquake.  This perishable data will be                                      
              compared at a later time with the pre-                                         
              earthquake measurements on the same walls, in                                  
              order to evaluate the performance of soil                                      
              nailed walls under seismic conditions.                                         
                                                                                             
              Soil nailing is a construction procedure used                                  
              to shore vertical soil cuts for temporary or                                   
              permanent purposes.  Related procedures                                        
              included conventional soldier pile and tie-                                    
              back systems.  Because of the uncertainties                                    
              involved with the design of soil nailed                                        
              walls, building officials have expressed                                       
              concern regarding soil nailing (Engineering
