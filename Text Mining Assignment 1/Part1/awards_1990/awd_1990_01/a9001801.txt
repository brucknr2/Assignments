Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator is currently addressing two areas              
              of research.  The first is the application of Casson-Gordon type               
              invariants to problems in link concordance, and, in particular,                
              to questions relating to boundary linking.  A second area of                   
              research is the study of periodic knots and symmetries of                      
              manifolds.  Both areas require the development of algebraic tools              
              for describing knots and links and for distinguishing truly                    
              distinct knots and links from ones which are merely differently                
              presented.  Application of such tools to classify knots and links              
              to within some natural equivalence is a major goal.
