Abstract    :
                   The ability of anthropologists to determine aspects of an                 
              animal's diet from morphological characteristics of its dentition              
              has greatly increased in recent years, especially through the use              
              of new techniques such as SEM (scanning electron microscope)                   
              examination of minute wear characteristics of the teeth.  The                  
              Principal Investigators will utilize this technique to determine               
              food categories of a diverse group mammals, including primates,                
              and use this information to make inferences about the diet of an               
              important group of Early Cenozoic primates, the Omomyidae.  This               
              study will be the first to assess quantitatively hypotheses about              
              dietary reconstruction of early fossil primates.  The potential                
              application of this study for understanding dietary aspects of                 
              other fossil taxa is great.
