Abstract    :
                   With this proposal Dr. Foster of MIT/Haystack Observatory                 
              seeks funds for a modest permanent CEDAR optical observatory on                
              MIT property near the Millstone Hill radar facility.  At present,              
              CEDAR optical instruments and visitors are housed at several                   
              separate locations on space available basis.  The new site would               
              provide a better optical horizon than any of the existing                      
              locations and consolidate instrumentation and facilitate access                
              to CEDAR investigators.*** //
