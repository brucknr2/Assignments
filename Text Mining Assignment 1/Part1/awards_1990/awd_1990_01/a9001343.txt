Abstract    :
                   Recent studies have been undertaken at sites scattered throughout         
              the world to analyze pollen and sediments in cores from bogs, lakes,           
              and other appropriate settings.  These analyses have shed considerable         
              light on changing patterns of vegetation and climate over the last             
              10,000 and more years.  One area that has not been intensively studied,        
              however, is the humid, subtropical region of southeastern China.  This         
              doctoral dissertation project will extract and analyze cores from bogs         
              in the Wuyi and Daiyun mountains of Fujian Province.  Radiocarbon              
              dating will help establish the ages of pollen and sediments within the         
              cores, and related analyses will help reconstruct vegetational and             
              climatic patterns in the region.                                               
                   This project will provide valuable information for reconstructing         
              the natural environmental history of southeastern China.  This                 
              reconstruction will be especially useful because it will help assess           
              the impacts of changing conditions on monsoon circulation, which is            
              such an important facet of the region's climate.   This project also           
              will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to         
              continue to develop independent research skills.
