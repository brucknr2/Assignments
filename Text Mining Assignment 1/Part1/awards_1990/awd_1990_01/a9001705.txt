Abstract    :
                   This is a program of research on several topics in                        
              combinatorial optimization with the objective of enhancing                     
              understanding of the underlying mathematics of some combinatorial              
              problems.  The importance of the research lies in the fact that a              
              better understanding of the mathematics associated with these                  
              problems (most of them belonging to the class of nonpolynomial-                
              complete or hard problems) can be used in the design of algorithms             
              that solve and prove optimality of medium to large instances that              
              typically arise in real world applications.  The research includes             
              investigation of the properties of 0, 1 matrices, whose                        
              associated set packing polytope has integer extreme points, and the            
              facial structure of some combinatorial polytopes associated with               
              connectivity and partitioning problems on graphs.  The algorithmic             
              issues associated with the detection of violated constraints for               
              such problems will be investigated.                                            
                   The problem area of combinatorial optimization is very                    
              important, a breakthrough in this area would be highly leveraged.
