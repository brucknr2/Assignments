Abstract    :
                   This project is an investigation into the representation                  
              theory and cohomology of finite groups over fields of prime                    
              characteristic. Of particular interest is the structure of                     
              modules and the homological properties of modules. The                         
              p+incipal investigator will work on the complexes associated to                
              polynomial subrings of the cohomology ring of a group. He will                 
              also study topological applications of the theory of varieties                 
              and cohomology rings.                                                          
                   The research supported concerns the representation of                     
              finite groups over fields. The structure of the groups is                      
              realized through the action of the groups as transformations on                
              spaces. This is currently one of the most active areas of pure                 
              algebra.
