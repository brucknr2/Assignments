Abstract    :
                   This research in theoretical nuclear physics will obtain                  
              an accurate assessment of the nuclear spectral function in                     
              terms of the nucleons structure function.  Recent lepton-                      
              nucleus scattering data will be analyzed to set limits on the                  
              magnitude of pure quark effects inside the nuclear medium.
