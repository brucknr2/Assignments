Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Between 10% and 40% of the Vanadium and Uranium entering                       
              the modern ocean as dissolved river input is eventually buried                 
              in sediments overlain by anoxic bottom water. Previous work by                 
              Dr. Mix and his colleague Dr. Emeron from the University                       
              of Washington has found that concentrations of V and U in                      
              foram tests have varied over the last 150 Kyrs. Provided                       
              the assumption is true tht formas incorporated these metals                    
              in equilibrium with seawater, this preliminary data suggests                   
              that bottom, water during the last glacial period was                          
              more oxygenated that at present, and that between Atlantic                     
              and Pacific bottom water was substantially different from that                 
              of today. In this renewal award the PIs will to continue                       
              their research in several directins: 1) they will perform                      
              culturing experiments with collaborator Dr. Erez in Israel to                  
              determine the uptake patterns of V and U in live forams; 2) they               
              will improve solid source mass spectometry techniques for                      
              measuring V and U in single species of forams; and 3) they will                
              apply these techniques to refine the history of anoxia in the                  
              world's oceans since the last interglacial
