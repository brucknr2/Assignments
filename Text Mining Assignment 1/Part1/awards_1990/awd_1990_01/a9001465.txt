Abstract    :
                   This research includes studies of:  nuclear structure                     
              primarily oriented toward exploration of collective multi-                     
              photon level-multiplets, such as quadrupole-quadrupole,                        
              quadrupole-octupole, and octupole-octupole multiplets; mixed                   
              symmetry states called into notice by the Interacting Boson                    
              Model in which protons and neutrons are in different boson                     
              bases, with different energies and different residual                          
              interaction strengths, neutron scattering as a probe of the                    
              strong, specific differences in electric quadrupole excitations                
              seen by neutrons as opposed to other hadrons or leptons; and                   
              astrophysics-related reactions important to an eventual Bromine                
              solar neutrino detector, and the Iodine reactions leading to                   
              Xenon, relevant to another and potentially more powerful                       
              neutrino detector.
