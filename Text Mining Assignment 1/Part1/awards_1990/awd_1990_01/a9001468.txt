Abstract    :
              This award supports a program of research to study sediment                    
              accumulation rates in five transects of sediment cores that                    
              cross today's primary flow path of Arctic bound Atlantic                       
              water (e.g., the West Spitsbergen Current).  Because the                       
              Wets Spitsbergen Current).  Because the West Spitsbergen                       
              Current is the primary importer of ocean heat to the High                      
              Arctic, and is responsible for maintaining the sea-ice free                    
              conditions in the Norwegian Sea, detailed knowledge of the                     
              history of this current is critical to a complete                              
              understanding of the transition form the last glaciation to                    
              the present warm, interglacial climate state.  Thermohaline                    
              processes on the broad Arctic margin shelves play an                           
              important role in the thermohaline circulation of the Arctic                   
              Seas.  This project will examine whether the West                              
              Spitsbergen Continental Shelf was glaciated during the Last                    
              Glacial Maximum (approximately 18 thousand years ago).  Ship                   
              time is provided at no charge to this proposal by the
