Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this workshop is to provide an assessment of               
              current research in the People's Republic of China in the areas                
              of computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), production               
              engineering, precision engineering, and production systems and                 
              process planning.  It will also afford the opportunity for                     
              interaction between Chinese and United States researchers on                   
              these subjects.  Through this interaction, the workshop will                   
              calibrate the research of our Chinese counterparts against that                
              of the United States research community.  To accomplish this a                 
              select group of Chinese researchers in the above-mentioned fields              
              will be invited to the United States to attend the National                    
              Science Foundation-sponsored Conference on Production Research                 
              and Technology-Advances in Manufacturing Systems Integration and               
              Processes, to be held January 8-12, 1990 at Arizona State                      
              University in Tempe, AZ.  After the meeting, visits would be                   
              arranged for the Chinese researchers to National Science                       
              Foundation-funded Engineering Research Centers in these fields as              
              well as to other University and industry research laboratories                 
              conducting similar work.  At the end of the workshop activity,                 
              the attendees of the workshop will be asked to submit a report                 
              detailing their observations and findings, summarizing their own               
              work, and comparing it to similar work they saw in the                         
              United States.
