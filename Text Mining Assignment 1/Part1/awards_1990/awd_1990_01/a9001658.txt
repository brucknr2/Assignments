Abstract    :
              This research is on theory and implementation of VLSI chips for a neural       
              type cell in the nodes of a neural network.  The design is based on the        
              model of transmission of information from the human eye to the visual          
              cortex.  The technique for implementing the model is pulse coded neural        
              type circuits.  A theory is being developed to explain the relationship        
              between the frequency generated by neural type circuits and the input          
              voltage level.  Neural type cells are being designed, fabricated, and          
              measured to test the theory and verify designs.
