Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the algebraic theory of                    
              quadratic forms over fields of characteristic different from                   
              two.  The principal investigator will investigate torsion-free                 
              properties in the Witt ring using Galois cohomology with                       
              coefficients in various Galois modules.  He will also study                    
              quadratic forms over elliptic curves defined over an arbitrary                 
              field.  In particular, he will use etale cohomology to                         
              investigate the Witt ring of such forms, especially when defined               
              over a local field.                                                            
                   This project is concerned with the theory of quadratic                    
              forms.  A quadratic form is a polynomial function of several                   
              variables which is homogeneous of degree two.  Quadratic forms                 
              over fields of characteristic other than two arise naturally from              
              the symmetric inner products on vector spaces over these fields.               
              Thus the forms are intimately connected to the geometry of the                 
              space.
