Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will develop inferential                       
              techniques for problems where it is thought the spatial locations              
              of the data are an important component of the assumed stochastic               
              model.  Three specific problems are considered:  (1) spatial                   
              prediction and regional mapping, (2) modeling and inference for                
              (marked) point processes, and (3) tumor-growth modeling based on               
              random sets.  Both theoretical and applied statistical issues are              
              addressed:  new spatial stochastic models will be built,                       
              parameter estimators will be developed, inference results for                  
              those estimators will be proved, and scientific applications on                
              real data will be featured.  This work will have impact on                     
              various fields such as earth sciences, geography, oceanography,                
              hydrology, and environmetrics.
