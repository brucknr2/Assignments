Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Data on natural populations and biological field station's                     
              habitat are a valuable resource, if properly managed and cared                 
              for.  Successful data management requires field stations to take               
              advantage of advances in technology, and to support staff at                   
              field stations.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This project will support a workshop to be held April 22-26,                   
              1990, at the Kellogg Biological Station, as a sucessor to a                    
              similar workshop held in 1982.  The purpose will be to assess the              
              progress that has been made since the earlier workshop, to share               
              and disseminate information, to recommend standards and protocols              
              to aid collaborative research and to propose new directions for                
              which pilot programs might lead the way.                                       
                                                                                             
              The workshop will be co-sponsored by the Organization of                       
              Biological Field Stations (OBFS) and the Southern Association of               
              Marine Labs (SAML), and will represent the diversity of sites and              
              the various stages of development of data management systems in                
              these two groups.  Approximately 40 representatives from field                 
              station and marine laboratories will be invited to participate in              
              one of three working groups:  1) Data Administration,  2)Database              
              Standards to Facilitate Collaborative Research, and  3)Computers               
              and Software for Data Management.  A report of the workshops                   
              conclusions and recommendation will be made to the National                    
              Science Foundation, and distributed to the institutions                        
              constitution OBFS and SAML, as well as to other interested                     
              scientists.
