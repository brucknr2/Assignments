Abstract    :
                   This proposal is to continue research in several areas of                 
              nonlinear applied dynamics.  Excitable systems---systems which                 
              can be triggered by a small stimulus---arise as models of several              
              physiological and chemical phenomena.  It is proposed to study                 
              such systems, with an emphasis on understanding the periodic and               
              aperiodic behavior that is seen.  Another project is studying                  
              models of polymerization reactors with multiple initiators, in                 
              collaboration with some chemical engineers.  The emphasis is to                
              model industrial processes as completely as possible and                       
              understand behaviors of reactors under different operating                     
              conditions so as to effect control, and in particular, prevent                 
              catastrophic runaway of reactors.  It is also proposed to                      
              continue work on understanding the stability of standing-and                   
              travelling-wave solutions of parabolic differential equations.
