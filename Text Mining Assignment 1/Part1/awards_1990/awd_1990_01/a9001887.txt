Abstract    :
                   This award will provide support to a group from Johns                     
              Hopkins University for a research program on the physics of                    
              elementary particles.  The research will be conducted at the                   
              Tevatron proton antiproton collider at Fermilab, CDF.  The                     
              primary responsibility of the group will be to work on the                     
              upgrade of the vertex detector at CDF using silicon strips for                 
              high precision tracking of the particles.  The aim is to be                    
              able to tag B mesons and study their properties and to pursue                  
              the search for the existence of the top quark.  The use of                     
              silicon strip detectors will also serve as test for their                      
              future use at very high energy and high luminosity colliders                   
              like the SSC.
