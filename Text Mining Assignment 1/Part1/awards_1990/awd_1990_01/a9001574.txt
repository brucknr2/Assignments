Abstract    :
                   Work on this project focuses on two areas related to the                  
              study of solutions of elliptic partial differential equations.                 
              These are the analysis of the biharmonic and polyharmonic                      
              equations on non-smooth domains and boundary value problems for                
              second order elliptic divergence form operators with non-smooth                
              coefficients.                                                                  
                   In past work it was discovered that the range of solvability              
              of higher order elliptic operators on non-smooth domains depended              
              on the dimension of the underlying domain.  There remains a gap                
              in the range in which the solution will have a finite norm (above              
              the quadratic).  If the domain has dimension four or greater then              
              solutions exist with unbounded p-norms for some value of p                     
              greater than two.  But the first value of p is not known, nor is               
              it known whether this gap reduces to zero as the dimension                     
              increases.  Work will be done in an effort to obtain sharp                     
              estimates on this range.                                                       
                   There is a close connection between the study of                          
              differential operators on non-smooth domains and those with                    
              non-smooth coefficients.  Research will concentrate on                         
              establishing representations of solutions through integrals of                 
              boundary values.  This is a particularly delicate matter.  In the              
              case of smooth coefficient operators, the integrals are Lebesgue               
              integrals (the harmonic measure is absolutely continuous with                  
              respect to surface measure).  This is not necessarily the case in              
              general.  Work will be done in establishing criteria which will                
              still guarantee the integral representation through approximation              
              procedures.  Once these are established, one can then begin to                 
              study the behavior of solutions as the variable is made to                     
              approach the domain boundary.
