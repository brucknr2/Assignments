Abstract    :
                   With this award the principal investigator will continue his              
              modelling of elliptical galactic systems and the analytical                    
              solution of the model problems.  In particular, he will construct              
              self-consistent models of elliptical galaxies by means of                      
              Staeckel potentials.  The main reasons for using Staeckel                      
              potentials are that they allow the same major orbit families as                
              those found from numerical simulations of realistic galactic                   
              models and they lead to mathematically tractable problems.                     
                   The aspect of astronomy that most of us are familiar with                 
              involves the use of telescopes to make observations of stars and               
              galaxies.  Another aspect that is less well known involves the                 
              construction of mathematical models of celestial objects in order              
              to gain a greater understanding of the physics of stellar                      
              systems.  This research involves the construction and analysis of              
              a model for elliptical galaxies by means of a potential that                   
              describes an interacting system of many bodies.
