Abstract    :
              Dr. Erwin D. Poliakoff is supported by a grant from the                        
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study synchrotron                   
              radiation induced fluorescence from molecular ions. These                      
              measurements give valuable insight into how electronic and                     
              nuclear motions are correlated in excited molecules; moreover,                 
              these results will also tell us about the origins of various                   
              light sources in the galaxy.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This work focuses on the correlation of electronic and nuclear                 
              motion (Franck-Condon breakdown), as well as related electron                  
              correlation effects (continuum coupling). Dispersed                            
              fluorescence has been used in previous work to demonstrate that                
              resolution is not limited by the excitation band width. This                   
              capability will permit studies that would not otherwise be                     
              feasible, including work on the photoionization of van der                     
              Waals species, transfer of shape resonant character between                    
              ionization continua and fluorescence from doubly-charged                       
              diatomic ions.
