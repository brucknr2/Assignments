Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study pseudodifferential                  
              techniques in the study of degenerate elliptic equations with                  
              applications to geometry.  He will extend techniques to determine              
              a spectral analysis of the Hodge-Laplace operator acting on                    
              differential forms on complete asymptotic hyperbolic manifolds of              
              infinite volume and on geometrically finite quotients of                       
              hyperbolic space.  Related projects involve the study of the                   
              relationship between unique continuation theorems for the                      
              Laplacian at infinity and the presence of negative curvature.                  
                   For many years mathematicians have studied the behavior of                
              certain differential operators on hypersurfaces which extend off               
              to infinity.  This study has its origins in the calculus of                    
              Newton.  In this project the principal investigator will analyze               
              operators which have large variations over very large domains                  
              "near" infinity.  In the past, only progress on operators which                
              have small local variations was made.
