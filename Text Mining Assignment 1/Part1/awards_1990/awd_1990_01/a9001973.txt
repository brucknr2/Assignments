Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Three investigators will study problems in the areas of                   
              geometric partial differential equations, mathematical physics,                
              and dynamical systems.  One will continue his investigation of                 
              geometric aspects of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem and the                   
              relationship between quantum field theory and low-dimensional                  
              topology.  A second will continue an ongoing investigation of the              
              harmonic map equation and its connections with Poisson-Lie                     
              structures and quantum groups.  She will also investigate the                  
              Yang-Mills functional in dimensions larger than four.  A third                 
              investigator will study the knot types of periodic orbits in the               
              Lorenz attractor.                                                              
                   Three investigators will continue ongoing projects involved               
              in differential equations, topology, and mathematical physics.                 
              Differential equations relate the rate of change of one or more                
              variables with respect to each other, or with respect to time.                 
              Topology is the mathematical study of shape.  Both of these areas              
              have a long history of use in mathematical physics.
