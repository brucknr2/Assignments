Abstract    :
              The University of Vermont will connect their campus network to                 
              the New England Academic and Research Network (NEARnet), a                     
              regional network which is part of the NSFNET.  Direct connection               
              to NEARnet will provide researchers with improved access to the                
              Internet and other national networks such as CSNET/Bitnet and                  
              USENET.  The proposed 1.5 million bit per second, dedicated,                   
              communication link will improve reliability, speed, turn-around,               
              and flexibility for data communication functions such as file                  
              transfer, remote login, and teleconferencing.  NEARnet will                    
              provide for equipment, maintenance, and information services.                  
                                                                                             
              The University of Vermont will be able to integrate                            
              supercomputing and collaborative research into graduate and                    
              udergraduate curricula.  In addition the State Library Services                
              and Middlebury College will be connected to the main campus and                
              provided connectivity to the rest of the Internet through                      
              already existing local networks.  This project thus provides                   
              sharing of resources among the state institutions, greatly                     
              facilitates research by students and faculty, and provides a                   
              valuable resource to supplement course work.***
