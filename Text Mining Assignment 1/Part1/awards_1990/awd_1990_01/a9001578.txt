Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study problems concerning                 
              manifolds with positive Ricci curvature, harmonic maps between                 
              spheres, and geometry and topology of manifolds with boundary.                 
              Obstructions to the existence of metrics on Riemannian manifolds               
              with prescribed curvature conditions will be investigated.  Dirac              
              bundles and Dirac operators on manifolds with boundary of                      
              dimension 4 and 5 will be analyzed.                                            
                   The mathematical object known as a torus has the shape of an              
              inner tube and is positively curved on the outer parts, while                  
              negatively curved around the hole.  As a fact, its total                       
              curvature is zero.  A long time ago mathematicians learned that                
              this meant, with a different concept of distance, the torus can                
              appear flat.  The principal investigator will continue his                     
              research into analogous problems concerning such prescribed                    
              curvature on higher-dimensional manifolds.
