Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in automorphic forms of                  
              Professor Don Blasius of the University of California at Los                   
              Angeles. Dr. Blasius's project is to complete the construction of              
              Galois representations for Maass forms of Galois type by                       
              extending to coherent cohomology certain methods of interpre-                  
              tation that have been established for holomorphic forms; to                    
              stabilize the Trace Formula for GSp(4), beginning with the                     
              Fundamental Lemma; and to study certain lifting problems                       
              involving Abelian varieties, in the setting of Shimura varieties,              
              applying his work on p-adic properties of Hodge classes.                       
                   Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                
              century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                    
              century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                      
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                 
              rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                   
              study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.              
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                     
              retains connection to its historical roots.
