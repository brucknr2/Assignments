Abstract    :
                   Bonahon will study limit sets of Kleinian groups and of                   
              hyperbolic groups.  A Kleinian group is a discrete group of                    
              isometries of hyperbolic 3-space.  Bonahon intends to study the                
              topological type of the limit set of a Kleinian group and show                 
              that it is determined by the algebraic structure of the group                  
              together with certain geometric invariants of the associated                   
              quotient space.  He also wants to study the asymptotic behavior                
              of the leaves of foliations of hyperbolic 3-space which are                    
              invariant under a Kleinian group (namely lifts of foliations of                
              hyperbolic 3-manifolds) and to analyze how fast these leaves                   
              approach the limit set of the group.                                           
                   Following Gromov's terminology, a hyperbolic group is a                   
              finitely generated group which has certain growth properties                   
              similar to those of a cocompact Kleinian group.  Such a                        
              hyperbolic group has a well defined limit set, also called its                 
              boundary.  Bonahon wants to analyze how certain topological                    
              properties of the limit set of a hyperbolic group are related to               
              algebraic properties of the group, involving in particular its                 
              outer automorphism group and decompositions into amalgamated                   
              products.                                                                      
                   Advances in the study of 3-dimensional manifolds in recent                
              years, following work of Thurston, has rather surprisingly shown               
              the extreme relevance of hyperbolic geometry to the understanding              
              of the structure of 3-manifolds.
