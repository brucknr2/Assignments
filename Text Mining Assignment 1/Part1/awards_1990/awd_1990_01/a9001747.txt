Abstract    :
                   The quality of forecasts made with numerical prediction                   
              models degrades during the numerical integration due to                        
              systematic errors, that is, errors that are related to the                     
              model's formulation.  Preliminary studies done with the Community              
              Climate Model (CCM) of the National Center for Atmospheric                     
              Research (NCAR) indicate that horizontal resolution may be a                   
              critical factor in the evolution and structure of planetary scale              
              waves which are simulated by the CCM.  The goal of this research               
              project is to determine the role of model resolution in                        
              systematic error.  It will be accomplished through simulations                 
              of five winter periods and several forecast experiments.  The                  
              results will have important implications for improving both                    
              extended range weather forecasts (up to 30 days) and climate                   
              models.                                                                        
                   This project represents a collaboration between Dr. T.-C.                 
              Chen, the principal investigator, and Dr. Joseph Tribbia, an NCAR              
              scientist.
