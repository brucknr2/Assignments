Abstract    :
              Dr. Catherine Murphy has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                  
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Murphy's doctoral degree was from                
              the University of Wisconsin under the supervision of Professor                 
              Arthur Ellis.  Dr. Murphy intends to continue research at the                  
              California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of                    
              Professor Jacqueline Barton.  Dr. Murphy's area of postdoctoral                
              training and research will be the application of solid state                   
              inorganic chemistry to problems of biological interest.  As a                  
              specific example, she will investigate photoluminesence of                     
              adsorbed semiconductor colloids onto biological surfaces as a                  
              probe of molecular conformation.                                               
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
