Abstract    :
                   Field experiments will be employed to investigate                         
              differences in the reproductive biology and population traits of               
                                                                                             
              a species of salamander.  Different populations of this amphibian              
                                                                                             
              exhibit very different growth rates, reproductive rates, and body              
                                                                                             
              sizes which appear to be related to differences in environmental               
                                                                                             
              quality.  This possibility and the alternative that the                        
              populations are genetically differentiated will be explored,                   
              using a series of experiments in which animals are raised in                   
              different environments in the field.  Other experiments involve                
              supplementally feeding animals in natural populations to                       
              ascertain the specific role of food abundance in determining                   
              these traits.  Patterns of response to the different conditions                
              will reveal how important the environment is in determining these              
                                                                                             
              traits.
