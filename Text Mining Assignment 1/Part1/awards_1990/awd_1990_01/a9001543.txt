Abstract    :
                   In recent years, genetic evidence has revealed that extra-                
              pair mating is more widespread in apparently monogamous bird                   
              species than previously thought.  The costs and benefits of                    
              extra-pair mating are poorly understood for males and females                  
              because of a paucity of data and because, until recently, the                  
              genetic techniques available were inadequate for determining                   
              paternity in natural populations.  In this study, parentage of                 
              young in nests of western bluebird (Sialia mexicana) pairs in                  
              central coastal California will be determined, and behavioral,                 
              demographic and genetic data will be used to address the                       
              functional consequences of extra-pair mating.  Parentage of young              
              in nests where more than one male cares for young will be                      
              determined, as well as whether supernumerary males are                         
              nonbreeding helpers or actually father offspring in the nests at               
              which they feed.   This study will clarify the mating system of                
              the western bluebired and will help to shed light on the extent                
              and success of extra-pair mating as a reproductive alternative to              
              strict monogamy.
