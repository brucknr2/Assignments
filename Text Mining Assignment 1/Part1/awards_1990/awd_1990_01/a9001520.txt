Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports the                  
              research to assess the feasibility of recovering ancient                       
              microorganisms entrapped in deep glacial ice cores.  A major goal              
              will be to establish the reliability of obtaining ancient                      
              organisms for comparative studies with contemporary ogranisms.                 
              The reseach will establish valid techniques for the recovery of                
              microorganisms from ice cores stored at the Ice Core Storage                   
              Facility in Buffalo, N.Y., and then attempt in recover viable,                 
              ancient organisms from ice cores drilled in Greenland and                      
              Antarctica.  By studying successively older strata in ice cores,               
              the longevity of different taxa entrapped in ice can be                        
              estimated.  Organisms that are successfully recovered can also be              
              used as model organisms for research on rates of biological                    
              evolution, mechanisms of dormancy, their ecological relevance and              
              processes of natural preservation.
