Abstract    :
              Professor Luther Erickson and other members of the Chemistry                   
              Department of Grinnell College are being supported to conduct a                
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in                          
              Chemistry.  For the period 1990-92, ten (10) undergraduate                     
              students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively engaged                
              in a variety of research projects.  Projects range from                        
              molecular orbital calculations on transition metal hydrides to                 
              investigation of the diffusion of analytes in solid polymers.                  
              Students will be expected to write a project proposal, carry                   
              out supervised experimental work, present a seminar on the                     
              proposal and a second seminar on the results, and write a                      
              detailed final report.
