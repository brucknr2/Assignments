Abstract    :
                   Professor Johnson will study linear differential operators                
              with bounded but non-decaying coefficients (which might be almost              
              periodic or paths of an ergodic process).  Using techniques from               
              dynamical systems theory, he will study spectral properties and                
              generalized Floquet exponents for such operators.  He will apply               
              his results in the following areas: bifurcation from invariant                 
              tori in non-linear dynamical systems; spectral properties of the               
              one-dimensional almost periodic Schroedinger operator; linear                  
              optimal control theory; the topological index theory of non-                   
              periodic ordinary and partial differential equations, and its                  
              relation with cohomology theory of certain C* algebras; the                    
              Korteweg-deVries equation with bounded initial data.                           
                   Johnson's research in differential equations is very broadly              
              based and has implications for a variety of fields ranging from                
              pure mathematics to physics and engineering.
