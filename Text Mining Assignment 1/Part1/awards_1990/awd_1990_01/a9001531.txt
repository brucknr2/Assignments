Abstract    :
                This research is to develop further the theoretical basis for                
              determining 3-D earth structure from long-period seismic data.                 
              The next major advance will be to invert a dataset that is an                  
              order of magnitude larger, of the order of 50,000 source-receiver              
              pairs which will be developed elsewhere.  Attention here will be               
              focused on the accuracy and possible biases of the various                     
              approximations and techniques that will have to be employed in                 
              such a large-scale study.  Specific topics to be addressed are                 
              the accurate computation of synthetic long-period seismograms,                 
              evaluation of approximate methods and inversion techniques, and                
              theoretical studies of geometrical optics, anisotropy, and the                 
              Born approximation.
