Abstract    :
              This research will continue a project to study climatically                    
              induced changes in biogenic sedimentation in the oceans.  The                  
              type of biogenic material found in core samples varies with the                
              paleoclimate and, therefore, appears to be temperature                         
              controlled.  This research project will develop more rapid                     
              methods for doing the analysis of the biogenic material, an                    
              extend the earlier studies  to both older sediment and other                   
              cores where independent estimates of paliotemperature have been                
              made.  The results of this research will lead to the                           
              understanding of causes for changes in primary productivity in                 
              the oceans during climatic changes.
