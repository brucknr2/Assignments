Abstract    :
              This study involves an historical-comparative analysis of Hindu-               
              Muslim enmity in four villages in rural West Bengal, India and                 
              Bangladesh.  The objective is to gain an understanding of the                  
              processes by which people think about disputes, pursue conflict,               
              and choose their enemies.  With this kind of information, it may               
              be possible to negotiate resolution of conflicts that occur in                 
              communally based ethnic, nationalist, and language-based                       
              conflicts.
