Abstract    :
                   The CEDAR ( Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric              
              Regions ) program has as part of its major goals the                           
              understanding of the mesosphere/lower thermosphere region of the               
              atmosphere.  One of the most powerful techniques used to study                 
              this region is optical lidar  and the CEDAR program has led in                 
              the development of sensitive state of the art rayleigh and                     
              resonance lidar systems.  This project is another step forward in              
              this area with the installation of a temperature measurement                   
              lidar system for that region of the atmosphere.  This will be                  
              only the second such system capable of routine temperature                     
              measurements in the world and will be the most advanced system.                
              This coupled with the simultaneous measurements with other lidar               
              systems and radar systems at the Urbana,Illinois field station                 
              will provide significant new incite into the dynamics of the                   
              mesosphere and lower thermosphere.
