Abstract    :
              Experimental investigations of the properties of amorphous                     
              semiconductors, especially metal-chalcogenide glasses, with the                
              intention of understanding the defects which occur in these                    
              materials.  Also to be addressed are questions regarding the                   
              microscopic origins of optically-induced paramagnetism and                     
              photodarkening in semiconducting chalcogenide glasses.  A                      
              broadly-based experimental program will be applied, including                  
              methods such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, optical                       
              spectroscopies, combinations of optical and magnetic resonance                 
              techniques, and electrical measurements.
