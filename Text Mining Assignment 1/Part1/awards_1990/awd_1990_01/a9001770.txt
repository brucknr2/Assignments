Abstract    :
              The subject of this research is to investigate the basic physics               
              of polymer gels, in particular their moleculer and microscopic                 
              structure, the kinetics of gelation, and the diffusion of                      
              particles and polymers in gels.  The problem of probe diffusion                
              in gels has a direct bearing on the practical problems of                      
              electrophoresis, and on the fundamental problem of polymer                     
              diffusion in random media.  The primary experimental tools that                
              will be used are static and dynamic laser light scattering.  An                
              investigation of the vibrational dynamics of gels using inelastic              
              neutron scattering and Raman spectroscopy is also proposed.  The               
              experimental work will be complemented by computer simulations of              
              gels.  This effort should lead to a better understanding of the                
              properties gels as materials.
