Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator works in the area of infinite                  
              particle systems.  Interacting particle systems are stochastic                 
              models for large systems of interacting components, and can be                 
              used to model the spread of disease through a population or the                
              consensus of voters in a population.  One topic the investigator               
              will study concerns the nonlinear voter models.  This class of                 
              models contains the "voter model", and initial indications                     
              (computer simulations) indicate that these models behave                       
              differently from the voter model.
