Abstract    :
                   Work on two kinds of nonclassical states is proposed. The                 
              first are states whose phase is correlated with their ampli-                   
              tude.  States of this kind can be detected by measuring their                  
              noise after they have passed through a Kerr medium. The                        
              objective is to develop a formalism for describing the                         
              phase/amplitude correlations for such states. The second set of                
              states to be studied are the so called squeezed states. In                     
              particular, those states which are squeezed in the mode ampli-                 
              tudes (quadratic squeezing). Three basic forms of quadratic                    
              squeezing have already been examined and it is proposed to                     
              study the nature of mixed forms of these states. Here,                         
              non-linear interactions can transform different types of                       
              quadratically squeezed states among themselves. These trans-                   
              formations will be studied in some detail in the proposal.
