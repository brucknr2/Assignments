Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide supplementary support for a long-term                  
              research stay by Dr. Barry Goodell of the University of Maine to               
              conduct collaborative research with Drs. Koichi Yamamoto and                   
              Hitoshi Karasawa of the Forestry and Forest Products Research                  
              Institute in Tsukuba, Japan.  They will study the biochemistry and             
              molecular biology of enzymatic wood degradation.                               
                                                                                             
              The mechanisms by which fungi penetrate and degrade wood cell                  
              walls are still incompletely understood.  Dr. Goodell's laboratory             
              has been investigating the action of degradative enzymes and                   
              metabolites using immunological probes and transmission electron               
              microscopy.  Dr. Yamamoto and Dr. Karasawa  have been using the                
              techniques of UV microspectrophotometry and scanning electron                  
              microscope-based X-ray analysis to localize and quantify lignin in             
              the wood cell.  It is hoped that collaboration will enable these               
              researchers to establish links between enzyme/metabolite function              
              and selective delignification.
