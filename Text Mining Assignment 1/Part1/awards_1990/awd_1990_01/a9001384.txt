Abstract    :
              This dissertation will research state effects on union demands                 
              and the climate of nonparticipation in Britain, France, and                    
              Germany between 1871 and 1975.  The student will collect and                   
              quantify qualitative data on state strategies and union power.                 
              The longitudinal data analysis will employ interrupted time-                   
              series and two-stage least squares models.
