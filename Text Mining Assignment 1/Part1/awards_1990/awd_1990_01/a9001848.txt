Abstract    :
              The Antarctic is now experiencing large springtime losses of                   
              stratospheric ozone, resulting in an increase in ultraviolet B (UVB,           
              280-320nm) radiation.  The magnitude of ultraviolet radiation reaching         
              the surface now approaches that measured in tropical latitudes. Perhaps        
              more importantly, UVB radiation has increased in the Antarctic while           
              both UVA (320-400nm) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR,          
              400-700nm) have remained unchanged.  Recent improvements in atmospheric        
              modeling and technology in oceanographic instrumentation will be used in       
              a six week field study during the austral spring 1990.  The prime              
              objective will be to document the impact of UV radiation on the                
              phytoplankton community during the ice-edge spring bloom.  During this         
              time, oceanographic processes create favorable conditions for increased        
              UVB susceptibility.  Biological and bio-optical information will be used       
              to define and quantify linkages between ozone-dependent oscillations in        
              UV to PAR ratios and phytoplankton productivity.  Special emphasis will        
              be placed on defining biological restraints imposed by enhanced UVB and        
              altered UVB:UVA:PAR ratios on the balance of UVB photodamage to                
              photorepair, photoprotective and photosynthetic mechanisms operating in        
              the Southern Ocean.  The overall aim is to test the hypothesis that            
              phytoplankton in Antarctic waters are adversely influenced by ozone            
              depletion.
