Abstract    :
              The goals of this dissertation research project to be performed                
              by Steven O. Shattuck and Professor Philip S. Ward of the                      
              University of California at Davis are to define genera within the              
              ant sub-family Dolichoderinae (about 1000 species worldwide, in                
              31 genera) and attempt to demonstrate their monophyly (having one              
              ancestral origin) based on morphological traits of workers,                    
              queens, males, and larvae.  Other goals are to analyze cladistic               
              relationships among these groups using rigorous methods of                     
              phylogenetic inference, develop a key to all known genera based                
              on the above-mentioned character analysis, and compile a species-              
              level catalog of all taxa (including information on current                    
              generic status, type locality, and if available, location and                  
              number of type specimens).  Preserved material at existing museum              
              collections in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom               
              will be examined for characters suitable for cladistic analysis.               
              Hypotheses about relationships among genera will be evaluated by               
              examining congruence between worker, queen, and male ant data                  
              sets and by statistical estimation of cladogram confidence                     
              limits.  Results will identify natural units for alpha-taxonomic               
              studies, provide a foundation for species-level phylogenetic                   
              investigations by elucidating sister-group relationships among                 
              genera, and assist in access to the taxonomic literature on the                
              Dolichoderinae.
