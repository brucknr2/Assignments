Abstract    :
                   Professors Culler and Shalen will continue their program for              
              estimating Margulis constants, injectivity radii, and volumes of               
              hyperbolic manifolds by using Sullivan-Patterson measures                      
              associated to 2-generator Kleinian groups.  They will investigate              
              group actions on generalized trees, extending research of Culler-              
              Vogtmann and Gillet-Shalen.  They will also apply the theory of                
              character varieties to the study of Heegaard splittings of non-                
              Haken 3-manifolds.                                                             
                   Culler will continue his work on cohomological properties of              
              the outer automorphism group of the free group.  Shalen will                   
              study questions about amalgamated free product decompositions and              
              deficiencies of subgroups, both in 3-manifold groups and in more               
              general finitely presented groups.  He will also investigate                   
              possible generalizations of Casson's invariant and connections                 
              with SL(2,C) representations of 3-manifold groups.                             
                   These are all very active topics in the topology of 3-                    
              dimensional manifolds, i.e. very natural geometric objects of the              
              same dimension as the space in which we live.
