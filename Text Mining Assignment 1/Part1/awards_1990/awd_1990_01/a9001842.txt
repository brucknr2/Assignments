Abstract    :
                   Professor Wogen will investigate several questions in the                 
              theory of Hilbert space operators.  These questions involve                    
              various notions of reflexivity for such operators.  In addition                
              the structure of the algebra of all operators which commute with               
              a given operator will be investigated and finally Professor Wogen              
              will examine the structure of certain types of composition                     
              operators.                                                                     
                   Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite matrices of              
              complex numbers.  These operators have applications in every area              
              of applied science as well as in pure mathematics.  This type of               
              research is an attempt to classify certain important classes of                
              such objects.
