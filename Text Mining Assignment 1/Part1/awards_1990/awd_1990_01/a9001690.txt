Abstract    :
              The research objective is to improve the fabrication of                        
              optical fibers (waveguides), by using aerosol doping.  The                     
              proposed method involves the transport and evaporation of an                   
              aerosol of solution droplets in the MCVD (Modified Chemical                    
              Vapor Deposition) and OVD (Outside Vapor Deposition)                           
              techniques.  The focus of this research is on the modelling                    
              fluid mechanics and heat transfer aspects.  The results will                   
              be included in previously developed computer codes for the                     
              MCVD process.  This work will be done in collaboration with                    
              the experimental effort carried out at Brown University.                       
                                                                                             
              The novelty of the proposal consists in the way in which the                   
              mist is created by an ultrasonic nebulizer and transported to                  
              the deposition surface.  The new techniques for the doping of                  
              non- volatile dopants into optical fibers have particular                      
              relevance to the fabrication of fiber laser amplifiers for                     
              telecommunications purposes.
