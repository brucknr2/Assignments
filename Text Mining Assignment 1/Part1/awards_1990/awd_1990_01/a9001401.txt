Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his work relating                
              various measures of dimension (e.g. Hausdorff and packing                      
              measures) to fractal objects of probabilistic origin (specific                 
              stochastic processes).  The investigator wishes to extend the                  
              theory in two directions:  firstly, to subsets of the d                        
              dimensional lattice and random walks on this lattice; and                      
              secondly, to the study of the sample paths of measure valued                   
              diffusions.  Since recent developments in physics in which ideas               
              involving fractals and their dimension play a prominent role,                  
              the work could have important implications for physicists.
