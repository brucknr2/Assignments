Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with characterizing geometries                 
              related to the Lie incidence geometries and other geometries                   
              related to simple groups. One part concerns geometries whose                   
              basic planar unit is an affine plane. A critical side issue of                 
              that study has been the determination of the geometric                         
              hyperplanes of the Lie incidence geometries. In this connection                
              a geometric characterization of alternating k-linear forms                     
              seems imminent. This would show that all hyperplanes of                        
              Grassman spaces arise from such forms. A second part concerns a                
              more long-range effort to generalize the characterizations of                  
              Lie incidence systems into a systematic whole. The third                       
              concerns some new directions into "non-parabolic" geometries                   
              related to simple groups. The fourth concerns substructures of                 
              polar spaces.                                                                  
                   The research in this project involves the interplay                       
              between finite dimensional geometry and the actions of groups                  
              of transformations on these geometries. This work has                          
              implications for the structure of finite groups, for algebraic                 
              coding theory, and for finite geometry.
