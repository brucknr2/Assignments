Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              include work at the interface between  particle physics and                    
              cosmology and work motivated by the superstring models of the                  
              basic forces and particles.  The cosmology - related research                  
              will deal with the role of quantum mechanics in the inflation                  
              of the universe and with the generation of galaxy - sized                      
              structure in the universe.  This research addresses very                       
              important issues relating to the evolution of the universe.
