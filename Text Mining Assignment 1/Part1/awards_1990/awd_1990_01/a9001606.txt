Abstract    :
                   With this proposal the principal investigator will continue               
              his analytical and numerical studies of discontinuous solutions                
              of mathematical models of viscous, compressible flows in two and               
              three space dimensions.  In particular, he will investigate the                
              well-posedness of the boundary value problems for the systems of               
              nonlinear hyperbolic equations resulting from the models, and he               
              will design improved numerical schemes for resolving the                       
              discontinuities present in the solutions.                                      
                   Very often mathematicians and fluid dynamicists study one-                
              dimensional models of complicated flow phenomena in order to gain              
              insights into the behavior of real flows in two and three space                
              dimensions.  In the present grant the principal investigator will              
              extend some of his results for one-dimensional models of the                   
              gasdynamic equations to more realistic models in higher                        
              dimensions.  Problems in more than one dimension are difficult,                
              and so the investigator will employ a combined analytical-                     
              numerical approach to study discontinuous solutions called                     
              "shocks".
