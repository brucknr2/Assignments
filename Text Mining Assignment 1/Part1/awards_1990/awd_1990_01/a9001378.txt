Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new Materials Research Group will investigate microstructure in              
              polycrystalline materials.  The objective is to study, in real                 
              time, the evolution of thermo-mechanical processing events, and                
              their impact on the mechanical, electrical, and elastic                        
              properties of engineering materials.  The work will exploit                    
              recent advances in electron diffraction techniques (backscatter                
              Kikuchi diffraction) which will enable automated measurements of               
              a new class of microstructural measures of texture in                          
              polycrystalline materials.  These microtextures are believed to                
              affect a wide range of material properties and performance.  The               
              scope of activity will involve an inter-disciplinary, multi-                   
              collaborator group, centered at Yale University, with additional               
              group members at Drexel University, The University of Bristol                  
              (England), and NIST (Boulder).  The research involves both                     
              theoretical and experimental aspects of texture analysis.  The                 
              project should result in development of a timely and necessary                 
              new generation of tools required to address fundamental topics                 
              which have great potential for application in materials                        
              processing occurring in both the primary and advanced metals                   
              industries.
