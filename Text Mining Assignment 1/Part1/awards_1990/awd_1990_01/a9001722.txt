Abstract    :
                   Let L be a local or global number field which is a finite                 
              extension of the field K. When L/K is Galois, classical Galois                 
              module theory seeks to understand the ring of integers in a                    
              number field as a module over its Galois group ring. This                      
              research will examine several questions in this vein. The                      
              principal investigator will determine suitable criteria for the                
              ring of integers in a number field to be locally free over its                 
              Galois group ring. He will also work on the classification of                  
              commutative, cocommutative prime-power rank Hopf algebras.                     
                   Number theory, which is the study of the properties of the                
              whole numbers, is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. In                
              modern days, problems in number theory have furnished the                      
              driving force for the creation of new mathematics in the fields                
              of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry. Some of the most                      
              recent applications of number theory have appeared in                          
              theoretical computer science and coding theory.
