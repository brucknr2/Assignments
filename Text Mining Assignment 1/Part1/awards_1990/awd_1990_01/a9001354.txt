Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the                           
              feasibility of modifying Bacillus expression systems which                     
              will allow vegetative cells to continuously produce and                        
              secrete proteins.  Very little is known about the                              
              capabilities of vegetative cells to synthesize and secrete                     
              proteins.  The modified expression systems could serve as a                    
              basis for new recombinant DNA technology for efficient                         
              production of commercially important Bacillus exoenzymes and                   
              heterologous foreign proteins.
