Abstract    :
              This renewal of Dr. Davis' previous grant, IRI-8801529, will                   
              support further development of his logic-based representation for              
              commonsense spatial and perceptual reasoning.  Past efforts have               
              developed a theory of qualitative spatial and physical reasoning               
              for predicting interactions of moving objects and behaviors of                 
              kinematic chains.  New work will focus on a strategic planner for              
              simulated and real robots, with emphasis on the use of knowledge               
              in planning of perceptual actions.
