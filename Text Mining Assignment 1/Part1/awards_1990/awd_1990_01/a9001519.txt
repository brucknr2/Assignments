Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research proposed here is a continuation of the previous                   
              grant, aimed at understanding the statistical mechanics and                    
              dynamics of a variety of surfaces and interfaces.  There are                   
              various interesting and fundamental issues, relevant to many                   
              different fields that remain to be probed.  Most of these                      
              questions fall into the following broad categories:  (1)  Random               
              Manifolds, such as polymers and membranes, obtained from                       
              embeddings in a higher dimensional space.  (2)  Evolving                       
              interfaces, such as a growing crystal facet, swelling gel, or a                
              flowing sandpile.  (3)  Interfaces and Paths in Random Media are               
              relevant to studies as diverse as the trapping of flux lines in a              
              dirty superconductor, to the interference of Feynman paths in a                
              doped semiconductor.
