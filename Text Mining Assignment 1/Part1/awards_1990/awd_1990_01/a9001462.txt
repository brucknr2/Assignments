Abstract    :
              In this project ("Cyclic and Polycyclic Organostannanes") in                   
              the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division,                        
              Professor Lawrence R. Sita in the Chemistry Department at                      
              Carneige Mellon University will study the bonding, physical,                   
              and structural properties of cyclic and polycyclic compounds of                
              tin. Some of the results from this study will lead to new                      
              insights concerning the design of new materials for solid state                
              applications.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This study of "Cyclic and Polycyclic Organostannanes" will                     
              bridge the curent gap in knowledge concerning the structure,                   
              bonding, and physical properties of cyclic and polycyclic                      
              compounds of tin.  The nature of bonding available to Group 14                 
              elements within ring-strained systems, the development of new                  
              synthetic methodology which will facilitate the construction of                
              a desired cyclic or polycyclic organostannane framework, the                   
              refinement of structure/bonding/physical property relationships                
              for tin, and the development of new spectroscopic techniques                   
              such as Sn-119 NMR, electrochemistry, and electron spin                        
              resonance (ESR) for investigating the molecular and electronic                 
              structure of cyclic and polycyclic organostannanes are being                   
              studied
