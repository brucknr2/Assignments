Abstract    :
              Dr. Stephen E. Johnson has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Johnson's doctoral degree was                    
              from the University of Massachusetts under the supervision of                  
              Professor Robert Holmes.  Dr. Johnson intends to continue                      
              research at UCLA under the sponsorship of Professor M.                         
              Frederick Hawthorne.  Dr. Johnson's area of training and                       
              research will be structural, spectroscopic and theoretical                     
              studies of main-group rings, clusters and hypervalent species.                 
              Specific research targets will be the synthesis, catalytic and                 
              materials properties, and bioinorganic applications of                         
              multiply-bonded boron systems.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
