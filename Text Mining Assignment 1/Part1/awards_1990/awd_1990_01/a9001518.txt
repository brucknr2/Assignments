Abstract    :
              Block copolymers are of great technological importance and                     
              simultaneously provide interesting opportunities to study basic                
              statistical effects in physical science.  Although some aspects                
              of the science of these copolymers are reasonably well                         
              understood, very little is known about their behavior when                     
              dissolved in binary liquid solvents or when they occupy the                    
              interface between two immiscible liquids, each of which is a good              
              solvent for one block of the copolymer.  A series of experiments               
              will be carried out on diblock and alternating copolymers                      
              dissolved in liquid mixtures to determine the effect of the                    
              polymer on:  1) the thermodynamics and capillary wave spectrum of              
              the liquid-liquid interface, 2) interfacial development under                  
              mechanically driven interfacial instabilities, and 3) composition              
              fluctuations in miscible liquid mixtures.  In all three cases,                 
              the liquid behavior is expected to affect the polymer                          
              conformation at the same time as the polymeric degrees of freedom              
              are affecting the interface(s), and the measurements will be                   
              directed toward understanding this behavior.
