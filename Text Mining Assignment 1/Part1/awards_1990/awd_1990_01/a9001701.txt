Abstract    :
                   Research in Plio-Pleistocene hominid paleontology over the                
              past four decades has focused largely on exploration and recovery              
              of fossils and artifacts from sites in East Africa.  All five                  
              known australopithecine sites in southern Africa were discovered               
              between 1924 and 1948; no new locality has been found in over                  
              forty years.  In order to appreciate the course of early hominid               
              development beyond that represented in East Africa, and in order               
              to gain a more precise picture of chronological relationships, it              
              is critical that additional fossiliferous localities be                        
              discovered in southern Africa.  Plio-Pleistocene sediments in                  
              southern Africa are represented by breccia-filled caves within                 
              the limestones of the Transvaal System.  The purpose of this                   
              project is to undertake a systematic, exploratory survey of the                
              outcrops along the eastern escarpment of the Transvaal System for              
              fossiliferous breccia caves, and to identify sites for future,                 
              long-term excavation.  The chances of finding such a rewarding                 
              site may not be high, but the extreme value to anthropology if                 
              such a site is found makes this exploration a most worthwhile                  
              risk.
