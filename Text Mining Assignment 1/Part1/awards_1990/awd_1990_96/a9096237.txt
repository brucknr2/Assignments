Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin are members of a family of                   
              neural-gastrointestinal peptides.  CCK is one of the most                      
              abundant vertebrate brain peptides.  The function(s) of CCK in                 
              nervous tissue is unknown.  This proposal outlines studies of a                
              CCK/gastrin homologue in the invertebrate, Drosophila.  Genomic                
              and cDNA clones have been isolated which contain two tandem DNA                
              sequences, each with strong homology to CCK.  Chromosomal                      
              localization maps the gene to the third chromosome.  Preliminary               
              in situ tissue localization indicates the presence of the                      
              transcript in the adult Drosophila head.  The immediate goals of               
              the proposal include:  1) complete genomic and cDNA sequence                   
              analyses, 2) isolation of naturally-occurring peptides and                     
              subsequent structural characterization, 3) identification of                   
              specific cells that express the gene by in situ hybridization, 4)              
              generation of antibodies to synthetic peptides whose structures                
              have been deduced from the DNA sequences and 5) construction of                
              an anatomical map for the peptides by immunohistochemistry.  DNA               
              sequence analysis will provide information on possible control                 
              elements within the gene.  Isolation of the naturally-occurring                
              peptides will confirm processing sites, identify structure and                 
              demonstrate peptide existence.  Structural data will be used to                
              design synthetic peptides for future physiological studies.                    
              Localization data will suggest a function.  This will provide                  
              information on regulation, processing and sites of action in                   
              Drosophila neural and gastrointestinal tissue.
