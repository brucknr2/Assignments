Abstract    :
                   This project aims to determine the role of magmatic                       
              processes in the development of large or high-grade tungsten (W)               
              skarn deposits associated with granitoid plutonism in western                  
              North America.  Previous work on this subject will be augmented                
              by further studies of (1) determination of contents of ore                     
              metals (W, Mo. Sn) in whole-rock and mineral samples of the                    
              plutonic rocks, (2) analyses for F, Cl, Li, and ferric/ferrous                 
              ratios in granitoid micas, and (3) stable isotope analyses of                  
              the plutonic rocks and associated alteration and ore minerals in               
              selected intrusions.  Goals of this work arc to establish                      
              whether or not the ore metals are intrinsically associated with                
              the intrusive  granitoid magmas, to infer compositions of                      
              associated fluids from analyses of the hydrous mineral phases,                 
              and to determine the extent to which mineralization and                        
              hydrothermal alteration are correlated.  End results will be an                
              improved concept of how the W ore deposits form.
