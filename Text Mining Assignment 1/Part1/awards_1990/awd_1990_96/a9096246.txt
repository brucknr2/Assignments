Abstract    :
              A set of experiments will be carried out to study natural                      
              convection heat transfer over horizontal and vertical heated                   
              surfaces using neutrally buoyant suspensions of                                
              microencapsulated phase change slurries.  The objectives are                   
              (1) to verify theoretical predictions of an order-of-magnitude                 
              enhancement of heat transfer effectiveness over single phase                   
              systems; (2) to develop correlations to predict heat transfer                  
              for different slurry concentrations; and (3) to define the                     
              flow and temperature fields in various enclosures for                          
              validation of future detailed theoretical models.                              
                                                                                             
              Thermal management of electronic devices becomes more                          
              important as miniaturization technology advances.  Passive                     
              cooling through natural convection has the advantage of                        
              simplicity and reliability, but the heat transfer coefficients                 
              resulting from traditional working fluids are insufficient to                  
              handle the very high heat fluxes.  This research aims to                       
              significantly extend the upper limit on natural convection by                  
              adding neutrally buoyant microspheres containing a phase                       
              change material to the fluid, greatly increasing the capacity                  
              to store heat.
