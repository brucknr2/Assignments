Abstract    :
                   This project is designed to reconstruct the history of                    
              climate in the northwestern United States during the last                      
              deglaciation.  It includes a field program in Montana and Oregon               
              to collect cores in lakes and bogs, and laboratory analysis of                 
              the samples for pollen fossils.  These new data will be combined               
              with some existing pollen data in this region to produce maps of               
              the distribution of vegetation throughout this period of rapid                 
              climate change.  The project will test two hypotheses: 1) that                 
              the atmospheric circulation changes induced by the melting of the              
              ice sheet resulted in a time-transgressive sequence of climate                 
              change from west to east and from north to south in this region;               
              and 2) that the effects of the summer insolation maximum produced              
              a differential climate response from west to east.  The results                
              of this research will provide important climatic boundary                      
              conditions in a region where present sample coverage is poor.
