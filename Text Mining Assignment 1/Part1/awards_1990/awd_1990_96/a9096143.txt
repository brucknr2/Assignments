Abstract    :
                   Alec Norton will work on problems related to the dynamical                
              behaviour of differentiable mappings in two dimensions. These in               
              turn are closely related to questions about the nature of the                  
              critical sets of differentiable functions. For example,                        
              information about the size of the image of a critical set can be               
              obtained from the degree of differentiability of the function                  
              concerned. Results such as these are closely related to the                    
              Morse-Sard theorem. These investigations are in many ways                      
              complementary to the more established works on conformal                       
              dynamics.                                                                      
                   Although the Morse-Sard has been used extensively as an                   
              analytic tool, Norton will be investigating its geometric                      
              ramifications. In particular he will use it to study the                       
              loxodromic mapping problem. This asks for diffeomorphisms of the               
              two dimensional sphere for which the poles satisfy certain                     
              properties. Previous work has shown that the degree of                         
              differentiability of the function plays an important role in                   
              these questions. In a slightly different direction he will try to              
              extend known results about Denjoy dynamics on the circle to the                
              torus.
