Abstract    :
              For several years the PI has operated one of the major                         
              geochemical laboratories in the US, and he has concentrated on                 
              problems dealing with the origin and evolution of the Earth's                  
              mantle.  During the previous funding period he and his associates              
              have: a) determined Sm/Nd ages for sub-continental mantle by                   
              analysis of silicate inclusions in diamonds: b) delineated a                   
              golbal isotopic anomaly belt (DUPAL anomaly) lying between the                 
              equator and 50 degrees S. latitude; cf) delimited the range of                 
              isotopic signatures for the subcontinental lithosphere by                      
              analysis of xenoliths and xenolith-bearing baslats from southern               
              Africa, Turkey, Hungary, Arizona, Poland, Spitzbergen and                      
              Nunivak; d) refined a model for the refractory incompatible                    
              element contents of the bulk silicate Earth; e) completed a                    
              variety of leaching experiments on clinopyroxenes from 2.7 by                  
              volcanic rocks to demonstrate the trustworthiness of this mineral              
              for recording initial Sr and Nd isotopic  mantle ratios; f)                    
              showed that while significant isotopic avriations exist on mantle              
              scale lengths of 10-50 meters, intra-mineral disequilibria is                  
              only demonstratabel in mantle xenoliths carrying a metasomatic                 
              imprint; and g) provided access to state-of-the-art isotopic                   
              facilities to over 400 scientists from MIT and elsewhere.  During              
              the five-year tenure of this award, it is proposed to continue                 
              these same general themes.  Particular effort will be placed on                
              the Pb and Os isotopic variations in mantle rocks by direct                    
              measurement of both ultramafic xenoliths and of smaples from the               
              Ronda ultramafic massif.
