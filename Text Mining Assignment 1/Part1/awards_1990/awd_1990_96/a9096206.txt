Abstract    :
                   The tidal motions in the atmosphere, which originate at                   
              stratospheric levels with the absorption of solar radiation by                 
              water vapor and by ozone, propagate upward through the                         
              mesosphere and dissipate in the thermosphere.  They transfer heat              
              and momentum (acceleration of the mean flow) into the region.                  
              the tidal motions are detected at mesospheric and thermospheric                
              levels (50 to 120km in altitude) by the doppler shift of the                   
              airglow emission lines, by meteor scatter radars, and by                       
              incoherent scatter radars.  This award is for a theoretical                    
              modelling effort to include the tides in a numerical general                   
              circulation model of the atmosphere running on the Cray computer               
              at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO.                
              The results of several coordinated observational campaigns on the              
              Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR)              
              will be interpreted in comparison with the model.
