Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to study theoretically stable crack          
              growth in thin structures.  Such structures have been observed                 
              experimentally to tolerate large increments of load after the onset            
              of crack growth.  The final results will be presented in the form of           
              material resistance curves, which will eventually provide the design           
              basis for more efficient and yet safe thin structures.
