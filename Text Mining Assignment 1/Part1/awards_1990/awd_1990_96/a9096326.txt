Abstract    :
                   A transect of rainforest on Costa Rica's eastern slope                    
              extends from near sea level on the Atlantic coastal plain to                   
              2,600 m in the volcanic peaks of the Central Cordillera.  This                 
              land corridor constitutes the last intact tract of primary                     
              rainforest spanning such elevational extremes left on Central                  
              America's Atlantic Slope, providing an unparalleled site for the               
              investigation of pristine tropical streams.  Previous studies                  
              suggest that phosphorus-rich streams draining swamp forest at the              
              lower end of this continuum are important sites of nitrogen                    
              transformation via microbial denitrification.  Micronutrient                   
              limitation of algal growth has also been demonstrated.                         
                      This study focuses on factors controlling algal production             
              and nitrogen transformations in a lowland swamp forest stream.                 
              It will advance our understanding of biogeochemical cycles in the              
              Central American tropics and the numerous factors affecting algal              
              primary production.  Major objectives are:  (1) to measure                     
              seasonal variation in nutrient levels and diurnal variations in                
              nutrient flux in selected stream reaches located within, above                 
              and below swamp forest; (2) to examine effects of nutrient                     
              additions, light and fish grazing on algal growth and primary                  
              production under different nutrient regimes above and below swamp              
              forest; and (3) to measure seasonal fluctuations in denitrifying               
              potentials of stream sediments under endogenous and nutrient-                  
              enriched conditions, within, above, and below swamp forest.
