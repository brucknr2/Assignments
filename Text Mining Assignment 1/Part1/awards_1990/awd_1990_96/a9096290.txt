Abstract    :
              This study will demonstrate the usefulness of strontium, carbon, and           
              oxygen isotopic ratios of biogenic carbonate for dating sediments from         
              glaciomarine environments and interpreting paleoclimatic conditions in         
              Antarctic continental shelves.  The award will support an isotopic             
              (strontium, oxygen and carbon) study of foraminifera and bivalves from         
              sediments of Oligocene to Recent age recovered from several drillholes         
              and outcrops on Antarctica.  Age estimates based on Sr isotope analyses        
              will provide useful information about sedimentary and glacial processes        
              in Antarctica, as well as permit correlation of glaciomarine sequences         
              and assist in their correlation to lower latitude sedimentary                  
              successions.  It is the goal of this study to provide direct                   
              information about the Cenozoic climate of Antarctic marginal seas,             
              which is presently lacking.  Paleoceanography will be inferred from            
              oxygen and carbon isotope ratios.  Isotopic data from Antarctic                
              bivalves and foraminifera will be compared with published records for          
              Cenozoic surface and deep waters at low and high latitudes.  This will         
              clarify the sources of bottom water formation in the world in the world        
              ocean and the relation between high and low latitude climates.
