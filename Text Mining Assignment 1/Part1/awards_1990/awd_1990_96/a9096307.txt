Abstract    :
                   The research involved is in two distinct but related areas                
              of local commutative algebra. One area is the study of systems                 
              of parameters in local rings whose smaller local cohomology                    
              modules have finite length and the effect of blowing-up an                     
              ideal generated by a system of parameters on such. The second                  
              area is the study of minimal birational regular local rings and                
              connections with the regular closure of ideals.                                
                   This project involves research on the interface of                        
              commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Given a curve, a                   
              commutative algebra can be associated with it. Information                     
              derived from studying the commutative algebra supplies                         
              information about the curve. This is a rapidly developing area                 
              which impacts many areas of mathematics.
