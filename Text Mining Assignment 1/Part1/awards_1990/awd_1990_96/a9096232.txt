Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study the geometry,                       
              topology, and moduli spaces of compact Kahler manifolds with                   
              semi-definite first Chern class.  Fundamental questions                        
              concerning these manifolds will be solved using tools from the                 
              theory of Kahler-Einstein metrics.  Specifically, the                          
              investigator will study a difficult problem posed by E. Calabi.                
              The first task will be to investigate certain associated complex               
              Monge-Ampere equations.  The involved methods will include                     
              Gromov's compactness theorem, Uhlenbeck's curvature estimates for              
              Yang-Mills connections, and some of Cheeger's work on injectivity              
              radiuses of Riemannian manifolds.                                              
                   In recent years the ties between geometric partial                        
              differential equations and the gauge field theories of modern                  
              physics have grown strong.  Inspired in part by physical                       
              problems, the principal investigator will study a variety of                   
              difficult questions related to differential geometry.  Solution                
              of these will have a profound effect on our deep understanding of              
              the universe.
