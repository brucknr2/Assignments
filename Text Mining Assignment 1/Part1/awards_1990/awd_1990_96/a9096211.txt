Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The investigator will spend 24 months examining the                       
              acquisition of grammatical tone by young children learning                     
              Sesotho, an African language which makes different use of tone                 
              than languages for which there have been previous tone-                        
              acquisition studies (Thai, Chinese, Japanese).  Analysis will be               
              within the theoretical framework of autosegmental phonology.                   
              Preliminary investigation indicates that some Sesotho grammatical              
              tone constructions are only mastered after several years,                      
              contrary to expectations that acquisition of tone patterns should              
              precede full mastery of a language's segmental phonology.                      
                                                                                             
                   Demuth has the advantage of excellent command of the                      
              language under investigation.  The methodology of the project has              
              been meticulously devised.  The results of the research will                   
              provide excellent comparative material to be used with the                     
              earlier studies of far better-known languages.
