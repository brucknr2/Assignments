Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in Elementary Particle                       
              Physics by Dr. Marjorie Shapiro, a Presidential Young                          
              Investigator.  Dr. Shapiro is working with the Collider                        
              Detector Facility (CDF), one of the foremost US experiment in                  
              High Energy in progress at Fermilab's Tevatron.  She is a major                
              contributor to the data analysis programs for the experiment.                  
              Her research will focus on the study of high invariant-mass                    
              quark and gluon scattering, with the hope of being able to use                 
              jets as a tool in the search for new particles.
