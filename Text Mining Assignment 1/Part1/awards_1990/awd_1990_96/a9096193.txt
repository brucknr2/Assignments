Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is concerned with the thermal aspects of material                
              cutting using abrasive water jets.  This cutting technique                     
              holds high promise of becoming a viable alternative to oxyfuel                 
              and plasma torches, lasers, saws, and diamond wires.  The                      
              proposed work will identify the temperature field induced in                   
              the workpiece by the cutting operation.  Another objective of                  
              the work is to examine the response of the cutting efficiency                  
              to external heating or cooling of the workpiece.
