Abstract    :
                   This project involves the study of computational techniques               
              for the approximation and control of systems governed by                       
              functional integro-differential equations of neutral type.  Such               
              systems arise in the modeling of certain aeroelastic control                   
              problems and include many singular integro-differential                        
              equations.  The approach here is based upon a state-space                      
              formulation and makes use of approximation results in functional               
              analytic semigroup theory to analyze the convergence of                        
              particular numerical schemes.  The main objectives of this                     
              project are:  (1) Select an "appropriate" state-space for                      
              singular neutral functional differential equations (SNFDE) and                 
              study the properties of the infinitesimal generator of the                     
              solution semigroup associated with the homogeneous SNFDE;  (2)                 
              Develop a general approximation framework for SNFDEs on the                    
              state-space and analyze the convergence properties of semi-                    
              discretized (i.e., averaging projections and various spline                    
              schemes) and fully-discretized numerical schemes for the                       
              approximate solutions to the SNFDE;  (3) Develop the duality                   
              theory for SNFDEs and discuss control and observation problems.
