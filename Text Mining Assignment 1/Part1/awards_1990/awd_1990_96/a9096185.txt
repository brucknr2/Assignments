Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Magnetic fields of sufficient strength are known to suppress                   
              mixing in fluidized beds of magnetically polarizable particles.                
              This research concerns the fluid mechanical behavior of                        
              magnetically stablilized liquid fluidized beds using various                   
              mixtures of particles, some magnetically polarizable for bed                   
              stabilization, and some having specific adsorptive properties                  
              suitable for an efficient biochemical separation process.                      
              Stability of the bed will be investigated as a function of the                 
              particle sizes, densities and composition, liquid velocity, and                
              magnetic field strength and orientation.  The research will also               
              examine protein separation in such beds.                                       
                                                                                             
              If successful stable operation of mixed particle fluidized beds                
              can be achieved, it would permit greater flexibility in fluidized              
              bed operations for biochemical separations and immediate adoption              
              by the industry through the use of already existing non-magnetic               
              particles having specialized adsorptive properties.  The study                 
              should also yield interesting information on stabilization of                  
              liquid fluidized beds in magnetic fields.
