Abstract    :
              Concentrated effort is directed toward research in positron emission           
              tomography (PET) and toward the technical aspects of beginning a new           
              PET center.  Current research includes attenuation correction for PET          
              using reprojection, maximum likelihood reconstruction, a detailed              
              quality assurance program for PET using advanced statistical                   
              techniques, and noise correlation and specification for tomographic            
              imaging.  Attention is focused on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)             
              imaging, including the development of physiological contrast agents and        
              optimization of pulse sequences for different imaging requirements.
