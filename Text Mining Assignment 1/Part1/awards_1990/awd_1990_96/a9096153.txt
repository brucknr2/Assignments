Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to better understand the                     
              nonlinear dynamics and evolution of atmospheric disturbances                   
              embedded in a zonally varying basic flow.  The research will be                
              done using a two-layer baroclinic model on the beta-plane and a                
              spherical coordinate barotropic model.  The two-layer model                    
              will allow the PIs to examine baroclinic, barotropic and                       
              topographic processes and to assess their combined role in                     
              determining the regional character and time variability of the                 
              zonal flow and wave disturbances.  The research with the                       
              barotropic model will assess the impact of using spherical                     
              geometry in simulating these types of flows.  In cases of weak                 
              nonlinearity, model solutions will be obtained analytically                    
              using asymptotic expansions and multiple space and time scales.                
                                                                                             
              Outside this limit, spectral transform methods will be used to                 
              obtain solutions numerically.  These investigations may provide                
              further insight into such observed atmospheric features as                     
              regional cyclogenesis, blocking, and low frequency variability.                
                   This project is being carried out in collaboration with                   
              Dr. Arthur Loesch, SUNY-Albany, under NSF grant ATM-8813621.
