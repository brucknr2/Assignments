Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Project studies the variations in spatial, temporal and size                   
              distribution of earthquakes that exist between different faults.               
              Examines whether or not strength properties (as interpreted by                 
              the seismic parameters) are related to the temporal, etc.,                     
              characteristics of the faults.  Studies the relationship between               
              the frequency of occurrence of step-like discontinuities, the                  
              size of earthquakes, and the total geological offset registered                
              along the trace of active strike slip faults.
