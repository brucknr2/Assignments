Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is now firmly established that heterotrophic microbes,                      
              bacteria and phagotrophic protozoa are responsible for a                       
              largepart of carbon/energy flow in marine food webs. Using                     
              fluorescently labeled bacteria prepared from                                   
              naturalbacterioplankton assemblages, it has been demonstrated                  
              that <20um ciliates, from waters in a salt marsh estuary and                   
              fromcoastal waters in the NWMediterranean Sea, could                           
              grazebacteria at high clearance rates. And these                               
              ciliatespreferentially ingest freely suspended, rather                         
              that particle-attached, bacteria. Previous studies have provided               
              indirectevidence for a positive feedback effect of                             
              bacterivorousprotozoa on bacterial growth. Continued                           
              investigations will beconducted on protozoa-bacteria trophic                   
              interactions in coastal pelagic food webs emphasizing the: 1)                  
              evaluation of short-termand fine spatial scale variations in both              
              bacterioplanktonproductivity and protozoan bacterivory within                  
              discrete watermasses; 2) examination of the extent of resource                 
              partitioningamong bacterivorous protozoa, especially with respect              
              to the size spectra of bacteria grazed by flagellates and                      
              ciliates; 3)determination of the efficiency of conversion of                   
              ingestedbacteria into protozoan biomass; and 4) testing the                    
              hypothesisthat decoupling estuarine bacteria from their protozoan              
              grazersresults in a change in bacterial metabolism.
