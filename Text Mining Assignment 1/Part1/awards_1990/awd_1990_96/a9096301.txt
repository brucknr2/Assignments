Abstract    :
                   Joshua Leslie will continue his research in the theory of                 
              infinite dimensional Lie groups. This is an area of growing                    
              importance because of its physical applications. The major                     
              objective is to investigate the extent to which the well known                 
              finite dimensional theory can be adapted to this more difficult                
              setting.                                                                       
                   Leslie will use his recently established techniques to try                
              to associate Lie groups to certain completions of Kac-Moody Lie                
              algebras. This is a difficult problem but his functional analytic              
              methods have already proved to be successful when applied to                   
              numerous significant classes of examples.
