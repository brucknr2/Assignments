Abstract    :
              The elastic and inelastic mechanical behavior of rubberlike and                
              soft biological materials subjected to large deformation will be               
              studies analytically and experimentally.  The role of the molecular            
              structure and effects due to prestress, preconditioning, and                   
              internal viscous damping will be investigated in technical and                 
              biomechanical applications.  Equations that include the molecular              
              chain number and predict the effect of preconditioning observed in             
              tests on elastomers and soft tissues will be derived.  The theory              
              will be confirmed by experiments and applied to study the effect               
              of preconditioning of arterial balloons used in various surgical               
              procedures will be studied theoretically and in laboratory                     
              experiments.
