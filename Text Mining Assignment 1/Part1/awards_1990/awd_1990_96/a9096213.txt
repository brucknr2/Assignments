Abstract    :
              A separator of a graph is a set of vertices whose removal breaks the           
              graph into small pieces.  A cycle separator is a simple cycle whose            
              vertices form a separator.  Finding separators is an essential part of         
              divide-and-conquer strategies for many graph-theoretic applications.           
              The PI has recently discovered that, surprisingly, every graph has a           
              cycle separator and such a cycle separator can be efficiently computed         
              by depth-first search in sequential and parallel computations.                 
              Consequently, depth-first search now assumes a new role as a divide-           
              and-conquer tool.  This linkage between cycle separators and depth-            
              first search has never been available before, and promises to bring            
              about unconventional applications of depth-first search.  This project         
              is intended to explore new possibilities opened up by the search-              
              separator linkage.
