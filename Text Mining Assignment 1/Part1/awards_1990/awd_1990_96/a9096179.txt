Abstract    :
              A novel parallel computer architecture for speeding up large-scale             
              discrete event simulation problems is investigated.  In contrast to            
              existing machines that require the programmer or compiler to perform           
              data dependence analysis at compile time, the VIRTUAL TIME MACHINE             
              (VTM) performs this task at runtime.  In particular, the VTM hardware          
              automatically detects and recovers from violations of data independence        
              constraints as they occur.  A sophisticated memory system that is              
              addressed using both a spatial and a temporal coordinate is used to            
              efficiently implement this mechanism.  Dynamic load                            
              balancing/scheduling policies are used to minimize the frequency of            
              dependency errors.
