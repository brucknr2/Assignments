Abstract    :
              The principal investigator proposes to develop a workstation,                  
              operating software, and methods that will allow researchers to                 
              analyze both the structure and dynamics of disordered helical                  
              polymers.  The facility will enable electron micrographs to be                 
              rapidly digitized and stored in a computer so that the images may              
              be processed at near real-time speeds, with all processing                     
              interactive via a raster graphic display.  The software being                  
              developed will allow for rapid analysis of hundreds of images.                 
              Assemblage of large statistical data bases of images, and their                
              associated parameters will allow for the averaging of subsets of               
              images.  Dynamical models of these protein polymers can then be                
              generated from the different conformations.  The disorder, which               
              is presently an obstacle to structure determination, will be                   
              exploited to reveal how these molecules flucturate both randomly               
              and as part of enzymatic cycles.  The study of biological                      
              structures should be one of the major beneficiaries of this                    
              technology.
