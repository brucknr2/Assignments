Abstract    :
              The Sixth U.S. National Conference on Wind Engineering will be                 
              held at the University of Houston, March 8-10, 1989.  The                      
              objectives of this meeting are:  1) to promote and expedite early              
              communication of research activities and findings; 2) to exchange              
              interdisciplinary information and knowledge; 3) to stimulate                   
              cooperative research activities, especially for integrated                     
              communication among academics, practitioners and the industries                
              related to wind engineering.  The conference proceedings will be               
              published and distributed at the meeting.
