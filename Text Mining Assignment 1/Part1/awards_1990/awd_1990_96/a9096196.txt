Abstract    :
                   This research continues an investigation of multi-agent                   
              planning. The theoretical basis of this work, the Group Element                
              Model (GEM), is implemented in a computer system (GEMPLAN). The                
              approach taken is to explicitly subdivide the planning problem into            
              regions of activity.  Research is targeted to discovering how                  
              planning constraints and properties can be localized within these              
              regions, and how coordination and synchronization can be maintained            
              between regions.  The technical approach is through first-order                
              temporal logic for constraint descriptions, and algorithms for                 
              local search and constraint satisfaction are developed.                        
                   The importance of this research is that multi-agent                       
              planning systems are useful in a wide variety of applications,                 
              such as factory scheduling and assembly by co-ordinated groups                 
              of robots.  This work develops both the theoretical basis and                  
              engineering experience required to expand multi-agent planning                 
              technology.
