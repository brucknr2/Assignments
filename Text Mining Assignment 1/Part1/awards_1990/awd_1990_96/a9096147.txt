Abstract    :
              This project is a two-year effort to develop a physically                      
              realistic ice-flow model of the flow band passing through ice                  
              stream B, West Antarctica.  The model will explicitly treat water              
              and till as well as ice.  Earlier models do not consider the                   
              unconsolidated bed that exists beneath ice stream B or water                   
              balance.  The proposed model will represent a significant advance              
              in the field.  Seismic data to be collected by investigators from              
              the University of Wisconsin during 1987-88 will be used to test                
              the model.  The model then will be used to assess the stability of             
              the West Antarctic ice sheet in light of possible anthropogenic                
              climatic changes, and to test possible scenarios for deposition of             
              sediments in the Ross Embayment.
