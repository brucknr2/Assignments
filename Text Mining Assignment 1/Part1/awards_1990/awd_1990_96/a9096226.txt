Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is designed to determine the structure of the                    
              enzyme proline endopeptidase, an ubiquitous cell constituent.                  
              The enzyme plays a unique role in the breakdown of proteins due                
              to the special feature of the propyl residues which have the                   
              properties of breaking alpha helices.  One form of this enzyme is              
              membrane bound and accumulates in synaptosomes isolated from                   
              vertebrate brain.  It is possible, therefore, that the enzyme has              
              a particular role in protein breakdown in the nervous tissue.                  
              The goals of this project are as follows: 1) to determine the                  
              structure of the enzyme through isolation and sequence analysis;               
              2) to identify the specific residues which are critical for                    
              enzymatic activity and 3) determine which factors are involved in              
              the heath-mediated conversion of the enzyme in an inactive form.
