Abstract    :
                   A hierarchy of numerical models will be used to investigate               
              the interactions between radiation, dynamics and chemistry of the              
              atmosphere, especially in regard to climatic effects of increases              
              in atmospheric trace gases.  The three year project will utilize               
              2-D models of the stratosphere and the troposphere to study                    
              effects of trace gas increases on global and regional ozone                    
              production, as well as the combined effects of changes in ozone                
              and other radiatively active trace gases on the tropospheric                   
              climate.  There are significant differences in initial radiative               
              forcing between increases in CO2 versus other radiatively-                     
              active trace gases.  General circulation model simulations using               
              the Community Climate Model of the National Center for                         
              Atmospheric Research will be carried out to investigate any                    
              differences in subsequent climatic feedbacks caused by increased               
              CO2 and other trace gases.                                                     
                                                                                             
                   This project should enhance our capability to model                       
              important physical and chemical processes that affect the climate              
              system and may lead to improved understanding of the extent to                 
              which C02 greenhouse warming will be augmented by other                        
              atmospheric trace gases.
