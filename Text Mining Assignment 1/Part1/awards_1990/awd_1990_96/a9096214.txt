Abstract    :
                   The problem of second order continuity of blending and                    
              fairing surfaces has received only approximate or very                         
              restricted solutions, although, it is a major challenge in                     
              Computer Aided Design of Naval and Aerospace surfaces, where it                
              is dictated by fluid dynamics.  Based upon the result of                       
              previous research in Variable Sweep Geometric Modeling, this                   
              research will develop a blending strategy that is                              
              mathematically exact and insures second order continuity of the                
              blend.                                                                         
                   The specific research objectives are summarized as                        
              follows: (1) Formulate the Variable Sweep representation of the                
              second order continuous blend of two second order continuous                   
              surfaces.  (2) Define trimming of the second order continuous                  
              blend near the ends of the blended edge.  (3) Formulate the                    
              (possibly recursive) definition of the blend of previously                     
              blended surfaces.
