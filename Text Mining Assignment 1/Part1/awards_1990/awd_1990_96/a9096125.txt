Abstract    :
                   This research program investigates the viscous flow of                    
              immiscible fluids in a Hele-Shaw cell.  The effects of transverse              
              variation of interface curvature, finite viscosity ratio,                      
              gravity, small tilt of cell wall and variable surface tension                  
              will be analyzed.                                                              
                   The results of this investigation are expected to resolve                 
              the known diagreemants between theoretical results and                         
              observations, both in nature and in experiments, on steady state               
              behavior and stability features of this type of fluid flows.
