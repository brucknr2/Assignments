Abstract    :
              Recognition of the microbial loop in marine and freshwater ecosystems is       
              changing the view of trophic dynamics and energy flow in these                 
              environments.  This project will focus on the structure and grazing            
              impact of microbial food webs in arctic aquatic systems of the Toolik          
              Lake region and its response to nutrient and predator manipulations.           
              During the first year, samples will be taken for determination of              
              seasonal microplankton abundance in both control and experimental lakes.       
              Fluorescently labelled algae will be used to assess trophic links within       
              the microbial loop.  During the second year of the study, grazing rates        
              of microplankton will be assessed by uptake of algae in control and            
              experimental lakes.  During both years, epilithic protozoan communities        
              in control and experimental reaches of an arctic river will also be            
              monitored.  All research will be coordinated with the Toolik Lake Long         
              Term Ecological Research (LTER) group for synoptic sampling.  This study       
              will provide insight for a tropic component which is fundamental for an        
              understanding of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems but is not              
              currently being addressed in the Toolik Lake LTER study.
