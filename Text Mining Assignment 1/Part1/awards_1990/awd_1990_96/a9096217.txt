Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the extent to which discursive                   
              practices are structured by region-specific native gender and                  
              class categories.  The investigator, a linguistic anthropologist,              
              will test three sets of hypotheses on gender and discursive                    
              practices which have been developed within the Durkheimian,                    
              rational-choice, and neo-Marxist theoretical frameworks.  These                
              hypotheses will be tested in six communities in North and South                
              Vietnam, which offers a valuable test case because the socio-                  
              cultural differences between North and South allow a controlled                
              comparison.  The methods will include extensive formal                         
              interviewing and the extensive tape-recording and transcription                
              of speech interactions.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it will create a very valuable              
              data-set of naturally occurring speech from a developing country,              
              collected under controlled conditions.  The knowledge gained                   
              about language changes with respect to gender relations in a                   
              country undergoing rapid socio-economic change will be valuable                
              as a comparison with gender relations in the developing world.                 
              The increased awareness of the theoretical importance of subtle                
              markers of inequality such as speech patterns that can result                  
              from this research can help us understand how to deal with                     
              inequality.
