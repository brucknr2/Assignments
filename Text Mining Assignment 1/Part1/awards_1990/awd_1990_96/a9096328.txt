Abstract    :
              This is an applied engineering research project which will determine           
              how the deformation of soft tissues in the neck may cause severe pain.         
              This study is based on the hypothesis that neck pain, not involving            
              nerve root compression due to bone deformation, is caused by the               
              mechanical deformation of spinal soft tissues.  Quasi-static                   
              mechanical testing of appropriate tissue will be performed under a             
              variety of loading conditions: flexion, extension, twisting etc.  From         
              these data, the strains in the tissues will be calculated in an                
              attempt to identify the cause of neck pain and injury not related to           
              disc-related nerve root compression.
