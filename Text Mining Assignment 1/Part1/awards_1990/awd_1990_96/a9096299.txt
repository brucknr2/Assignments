Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The adult mammalian cochlea contains at least two morphological                
              types of spiral ganglion neurons.  Type-I spiral ganglion cells                
              contact inner hair cells via thick radial fibers while type-II                 
              spiral ganglion cells contact outer hair cells via thinner outer               
              spiral fibers.  However, in newborn cochlea spiral ganglion cells              
              appear as a homogeneous population, and some spiral ganglion                   
              cells appear to contact both inner and outer hair cells.                       
                                                                                             
              This research on guinea pigs and hamsters will focus on the                    
              spiral ganglion cell innervation of outer hair cells at a single-              
              cell level.  The overall objective of this research is to gain                 
              additional insights into the role of type-II neurons in hearing                
              by extensively studying their anatomical development.  Such a                  
              systematic study will help to further resolve how adult                        
              innervation patterns arise.
