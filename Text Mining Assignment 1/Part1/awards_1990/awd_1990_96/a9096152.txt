Abstract    :
                   The research proposed in this application is to develop new               
              and improved old methods for obtaining evolutionary information                
              from the multitude of protein and nucleic acid sequences that                  
              result from the revolutionary new techniques in molecular                      
              biology.  These include the construction of phylogenetic trees,                
              the formulation of ancestral genes and gene products, the                      
              detecting and formulating of unequal crossover events, gene                    
              conversions and hybridization, the examination of mutagenic                    
              events and frequencies during evolution, the study of                          
              restrictions imposed upon evolutionary development by structure-               
              function relationships, and the application of the principles                  
              derived therefrom to the study of population genetics.
