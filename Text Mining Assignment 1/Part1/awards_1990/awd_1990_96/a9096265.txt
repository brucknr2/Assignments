Abstract    :
                   In the past several years, the mathematical objects known as              
              feature structures have been employed by numerous research                     
              traditions in theoretical and computational linguistics                        
              (collectively referred to as "unification-based grammar") for                  
              modeling a wide range of phenomena in the domain of natural                    
              language.  The principal investigator will explore the thesis that             
              the formalism of feature structures, appropriately extended, is                
              capable of serving as the foundation for mathematically precise and            
              computationally tractable theories of natural language structure               
              that have determinate empirical consequences.  The researcher would            
              then apply such extensions to the formalization of explicit                    
              "principle-based" linguistic theories and to the construction of               
              practical NLP programs, focussing upon such centrally important                
              linguistic phenomena as word order, binding, long-distance                     
              dependencies ("A-bar movement"), and discourse structure.                      
                   Extensions to be investigated include, inter alia, the                    
              following:  (1) different varieties of negative constraints                    
              (classical negation, intuitionistic negation, and apartness);                  
              (2) different varieties of type regiments (via the logic, via                  
              structural constraints on graphs, via sorting of algebraic models)             
              and associated inheritance schemes (inclusion polymorphism);                   
              (3) realization of such notions as list value and set value                    
              (parametric polymorphism); (4) predicates other than equality (e.g.            
              inequality, append, subset, union) and "building-in" of equational             
              theories (generalized unification); (5) methods for introducing                
              recursion; (6) infinitary methods (e.g. "functional uncertainty);              
              and (7) dynamic interpretation.
