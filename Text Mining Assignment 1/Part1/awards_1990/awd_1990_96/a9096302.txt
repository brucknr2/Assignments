Abstract    :
                This research will do a systematic, global study of seismic                  
              deformation at convergent plate boundaries within the framework                
              of plate tectonics.  The patterns of seismic deformation observed              
              at convergent plate boundaries are often not in accord with plate              
              tectonic theory in its simplest form.  The work will make use of               
              catalogs and compilations of earthquake focal mechanisms as well               
              as geological data regarding rates of late Quaternary fault                    
              offsets.  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a global                 
              survey or map of seismic (instantaneous) deformation at and in                 
              the vicinity of plate margins, which can be compared with plate                
              tectonic model predictions and, hopefully, in the near future,                 
              large numbers of geodetic measurements that will become available              
              as space-based geodetic (GPS and VLBI) surveys progress.  This                 
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                      
              Reduction Program.
