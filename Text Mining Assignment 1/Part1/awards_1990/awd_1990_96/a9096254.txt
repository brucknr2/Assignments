Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Stephen Milne.              
              His work will concentrate on the interrelationships among the                  
              fields of Combinatorics, Lie Algebras, and Hypergeometric Series.              
              His principal goal will be to develop the theory and applications              
              of his recent U(n) generalization of the Bailey Transform and the              
              Bailey Lemma. This program has already led to the discovery and                
              proof of many new theorems for multiple q-series and summations,               
              connection coefficient theory, orthogonal polynomials, and                     
              related combinatorial applications.                                            
                   This research falls in the broad category of Combinatorics,               
              which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                 
              Fundamentally, Combinatorics represents a systematization of the               
              very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                    
              modern development, however, Combinatorics has gone beyond just                
              counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                
              techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the              
              field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                 
              because of its importance in communications and information                    
              technology.
