Abstract    :
                      This research will investigate the usefulness of applying              
              heuristic search algorithms, an important class of artificial                  
              intelligence problem solving techniques, to solve various types of             
              Markov decision processes.  The aim of the research is to enhance the          
              tractability of these models of sequential decision making under               
              uncertainty.  It is anticipated that the research will produce needed          
              extensions of a wide class of heuristic search algorithms as well as           
              suggesting potential areas for integrating concepts in heuristic               
              search with concepts associated with stochastic control and the                
              decision sciences.
