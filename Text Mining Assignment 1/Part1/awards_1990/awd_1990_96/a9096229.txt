Abstract    :
              The tubular pinch phenomenon will be investigated for                          
              potential application to harvesting of bioparticles.  A                        
              separation from a dilute suspension will be attempted using a                  
              branched flow path.  Variables such as branch length diameter,                 
              angle and number will by systematically investigated.  Systems                 
              where the bioparticle concentration exceeds 1% on a dry basis                  
              will also be examined.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Though the Segre-Silberberg tubular pinch effect has been                      
              known for 40 years it has yet to see significant industrial                    
              application, though it has seen some successful application in                 
              concentrating red blood cells.  Though successful application                  
              of the effect in biotechnology applications is uncertain, the                  
              potential for an alternative complement to membranes is well                   
              worth pursuing.
