Abstract    :
              One of the most striking properties of the pigmented bacterium                 
              Serratia marcescens is the phenomenon of color instability.                    
              Different strains differ greatly both in color and in the                      
              frequency with which they produce color variants.  Within a                    
              strain, the variations occur at constant rates and are                         
              reversible.  The high degree of genetic instability is                         
              reminiscent of DNA rearrangements such as transpositions,                      
              deletions or inversions which are found to occur during various                
              biological processes.                                                          
                                                                                             
              During an investigation of this phenomenon Dr. Harshey observed                
              that variation of a 39 kilodalton protein in S. marcescens strain              
              274, is closely associated with color variation.  Using                        
              antibodies to this protein she identified it as being the                      
              bacterial flagellin.  Neither color nor flagellin are produced at              
              temperatures above 37 oC.  Thus, pigment synthesis and flagellin               
              synthesis appear to be co-regulated.  We propose to isolate and                
              characterize the gene(s) for Serratia flagellin.
