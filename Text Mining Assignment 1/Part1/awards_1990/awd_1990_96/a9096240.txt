Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to identify new technologies in               
              image analysis and and computer graphics that may have applications            
              for observing and evaluating fluid transport in porous media.  This            
              is the initial increment of support for research to be undertaken by           
              this Presidential Young Investigator who has an interest in using              
              visual analytical techniques for analyzing the transport of immiscible         
              fluids through porous media as a step toward formulation of physical           
              models that can be used to predict the rate of diffusion and                   
              dispersion of groundwater pollutants.  The work involves use of                
              digital image analysis techniques for analysis of microscopic                  
              transport processes, observation and quantification of small-scale             
              variations in pore structure and fluid properties on macroscopic               
              transport processes as steps toward obtaining a better understanding           
              than now exists of the transport of immiscible fluids in porous                
              media.  This, in turn, is expected to have applicability in                    
              engineering design of systems for management of fluids that pose a             
              threat to the quality of groundwater used for industrial, commercial           
              and municipal purposes.
