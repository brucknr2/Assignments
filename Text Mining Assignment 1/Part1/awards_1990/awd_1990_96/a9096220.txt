Abstract    :
                   This project in scientific computation incorporates research              
              in numerical analysis, aspects of computer science, and solution               
              of model problems in mechanics.  The principal investigator will               
              focus on four research areas in the proposal: free boundary                    
              problems in fluid dynamics; high.order discretizations in three                
              dimensions for incompressible continua; automated programming of               
              scientific algorithms on parallel computers; and multi.grid                    
              methods on adaptively refined meshes.
