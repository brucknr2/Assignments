Abstract    :
              This proposal investigates the sources and dimensions of                       
              difficulty in decision making.  Just as risk management practices              
              were advanced by an understanding of the dimensions of risk, the               
              proposal argues, so should decision management practices be                    
              advanced by an understanding of the dimensions of perceived                    
              difficulty.  The proposed research effort seeks to understand the              
              sources of perceived difficulty by testing whether experts' and                
              non.experts' intuitions differ from analytic results in                        
              systematic ways, using physicians' analyses of medical dilemmas                
              as the primary data source.  Specific strategies for reducing the              
              difficulty of decisions, such as improving the presentation of                 
              information about temporal consequences and about differences in               
              option sets, will be tested in the context of real.world                       
              decisions typically faced by physicians and by non.physicians.                 
              The ultimate goal of the project, which is to learn new ways to                
              make decisions less difficult, was considered to be important                  
              from both a theoretical and applied perspective, and the                       
              principal investigators were believed to have both the experience              
              and the contacts necessary to design and to conduct the proposed               
              empirical research.
