Abstract    :
              Professor Christopher Henley has been given a Presidential Young               
              Investigator award to study dynamics in disordered systems.  He                
              will be investigating the connections between various kinds of                 
              disorder and work toward bridging the gap between macroscopic,                 
              statistical physics, and microscopic interactions in various                   
              systems.
