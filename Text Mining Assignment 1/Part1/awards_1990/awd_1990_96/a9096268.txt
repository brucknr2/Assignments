Abstract    :
                   The principle investigator will study the inverse                         
              scattering problem by using two mathematical methods called                    
              the Wiener-Hopf factorization of operators and the generalized                 
              Muskhelishvili-Vekua method.  Besides being powerful tools to                  
              solve an important problem in physics, the methods of this                     
              proposal will also contribute to various pure and applied areas                
              of mathematics such as operator theory, functional analysis,                   
              partial differential equations, integral equations, and complex                
              analysis.
