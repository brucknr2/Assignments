Abstract    :
                      The plan is to develop a fuzzy controller with learning                
              capabilities.  The controller is to be able to upgrade its                     
              performance by using non-fuzzy techniques.                                     
                      The research is to develop a new control technology-fuzzy              
              logic control.  Fuzzy logic and learning theory are used in                    
              controlling complex dynamic processes.  The process in this                    
              research is a fluidized bed combustion system.  The plan of the                
              research follows:  l) develop simple computer model of fluidized               
              bed combustor (FBC), 2) formulate control policy by interviewing               
              FBC operator, 3) simulate fuzzy logic controller on digital                    
              computer, 4) implement fuzzy logic controller on existing small-               
              scale FBC, 5) compare implementation with simulation, 6) apply                 
              learning control algorithms and conduct tests with new                         
              controller, and 7) compare old controller with new controller.
