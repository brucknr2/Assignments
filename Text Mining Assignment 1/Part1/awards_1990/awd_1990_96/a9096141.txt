Abstract    :
              Dr. Vogel will conduct a research program with this Presidential               
              Young Investigator award which will focus on the application of                
              millimeter and centimeter wavelength astronomy techniques to the               
              study of the interstellar medium and star formation.  Three areas              
              will be emphasized: the protostellar collapse phase, the                       
              evolution of ultracompact HII regions, and star formation in                   
              nearby spiral galaxies.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Conclusive evidence for the collapse of an interstellar molecular              
              cloud to make a star has been extremely difficult to obtain.  One              
              problem has been that the characteristic signatures of collapse                
              become evident only on the smallest spatial scales, which makes                
              high angular resolution observations essential.  Another problem               
              is that other gas motions such as outflow occur as the collapse                
              continues.  Dr. Vogel will concentrate on a sample of objects                  
              which do not show evidence of masking gas motions, and he will                 
              use newly available observational facilities and techniques in an              
              attempt to obtain the elusive direct evidence of a cloud                       
              collapsing to form a star.
