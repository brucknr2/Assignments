Abstract    :
                   Previous work on shape extraction and description by slice-to-            
              slice contour matching will be extended to multiple objects with               
              branching structures.  Both surface fitting and volumetric modeling            
              will be explored, with emphasis on high-level operations and                   
              recognition of "obvious" correspondences.  Both spatial (or                    
              temporal) position and 2-D shape understanding will thus be used to            
              attack the 3-D correspondence problem in a biological domain                   
              (retinal microscopy) where shapes are complex and neither size nor             
              orientation is constant from one slice to the next.
