Abstract    :
              This research addresses several related topics of control theory.  The         
              first problem is concerned with issues of controllability of linear            
              systems with state and control constraints which is of interest to             
              control engineers when attempting to deal with system elements that            
              can overload or saturate.  The second problem of parameterization is           
              important in adaptive control applications when simultaneous control           
              and plant identification is important.  Finally, the idea of feedback          
              transformations (linearization) of nonlinear systems in a                      
              multivariable setting provides a possible means of controlling certain         
              complicated nonlinear systems.
