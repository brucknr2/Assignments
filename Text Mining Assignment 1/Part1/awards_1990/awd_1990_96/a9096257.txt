Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the collaboration of two cultural                        
              anthropologists who will interview a relatively small sample of                
              North American "persons-in-the-street" about their perceptions                 
              and moral evaluations of the environmental problems of global                  
              climate change.  A "folk model" will be constructed that                       
              represents these beliefs, which will be compared with a similar                
              set of interviews and model elicited from specialists whose jobs               
              affect the environment (utility analysts, environmental                        
              lobbyists, congressional staff, and others).  These data will                  
              contribute to an analysis of theoretical questions involving the               
              pattern and meaning of intracultural variation, such as how                    
              knowledge of the mechanisms and consequences of global warming                 
              are socially distributed, and whether this knowledge consists of               
              collections of unconnected facts or systems of propositions.                   
                                                                                             
              This research is important because concerns about the state of                 
              the environment are gaining more significance in society.                      
              Increased understanding of the structure of popular understanding              
              of these issues, and the moral evaluations that go along with                  
              opinions, will help policy makers understand public reactions.
