Abstract    :
                   This is a renewal of a study to examine trends in the number              
              and quality of technological innovations produced in U.S.                      
              industry.  Innovations in two specific fields, biotechnology and               
              light-wave engineering, will be studied in terms of both their                 
              number and their quality.  These innovation trends will be                     
              related if possible to productivity changes in the related                     
              industries.                                                                    
                   The project is intended to provide indicators of U.S.                     
              performance in these important new technologies and to add to the              
              understanding of productivity trends by focusing on the                        
              underlying technologies.
