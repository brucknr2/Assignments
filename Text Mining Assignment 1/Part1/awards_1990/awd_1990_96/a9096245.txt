Abstract    :
              A three-pronged research effort will be initiated.  Four projects in           
              three categories, genetic algorithms, classifier (rule-learning)               
              systems, and fluid pipeline simulation and control, will be undertaken.        
              The role of dominance operators in genetic algorithms will be studied          
              to demonstrate their importance in non-stationary environments;                
              extensions to classifier systems will be studied to enhance their              
              rule-learning capability when applied to dynamic system control;               
              stochastic interpolations in time will be studied as a new numerical           
              solution technique for hyperbolic partial differential equations with          
              possible efficiency and accuracy advantages; and a pipeline operations         
              laboratory will be established at the University of Alabama with its           
              first project targeted at advanced pipeline simulation.
