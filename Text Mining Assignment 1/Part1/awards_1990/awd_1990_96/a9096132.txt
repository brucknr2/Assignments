Abstract    :
                   This research involves the construction of a series of                    
              computational models of common-sense reasoning about emotion-related           
              phenomena.  Computer programs capable of making inferences,                    
              constructing explanations, and learning about cognitive causes of              
              emotions will be constructed.  These computer models will be based             
              on a theory of emotion that describes when emotions might arise,               
              why, and what their likely consequences are.  The principal                    
              investigator will develop an AI system that can reason about                   
              motivation and generate plausible explanations about emotion-                  
              relevant phenomena.  The system will be validated by comparing the             
              explanations it produces with explanations created by people and by            
              having people evaluate the plausibility and coherence of the                   
              automatically constructed explanations.
