Abstract    :
                   In general terms this project is devoted to simplifying and               
              making more usable several powerful, complicated, and subtle                   
              algebraic techniques of topology.  In the 1960's, Daniel Quillen               
              described how to define the homology of simplical objects over                 
              many different categories, including sets, algebras over a ring,               
              and unstable algebras over the Steenrod algebra.  Many of the                  
              calculations in homology theory can be cast in this light, among               
              them the computation of the E2-term of certain "unstable Adams                 
              spectral sequences" such as the Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence.               
              Past experience has indicated the strength of this approach; the               
              purpose of this project is to explore this idea in depth.  A                   
              particular ramification would be the exploration of the homology               
              of function complexes using tools of Jean Lannes and A.K.                      
              Bousfield.
