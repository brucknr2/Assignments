Abstract    :
                      This is a project to determine the sulfide petrology, sulfur           
              contents, and sulfur isotopic compositions of well documented                  
              fresh submarine glasses and rocks form the Mariana Arc and back                
              arc trough.  The goal is to evaluate the sources and sinks of                  
              sulfur in these rocks in order to investigate role of subducted                
              oceanic lithosphere and hydrothermally altered fore arc rocks in               
              the generation of back arc basin magmas. These data will also be               
              useful for understanding the sources of sulfur in massive sulfide              
              ore deposits  formed in back arc settings.                                     
              %%%                                                                            
                      A primary goal in petrogenesis is to understand the source             
              materials of magmas that are produced in various settings.  One                
              important setting in the ocean crust is the back arc basin.  Back              
              arc basin magmas are thought to be derived from mixing of two                  
              different mantle sources.  Because the suggested sources have                  
              different sulfur isotopic compositions, their analysis in the                  
              rocks from the Mariana Arc and back arc trough will provide                    
              fundamental new data to help sort out the sources of back arc                  
              basin magmas. A study of the sulfide petrology will help to                    
              determine the fate of sulfur in back arc basin magmas.
