Abstract    :
                   This project is mathematical research in the representation               
              theory of Lie groups.  A suitable example of the latter is the                 
              group of rotations of a sphere.  Groups like this are important                
              because they occur in many areas of mathematics ( e.g. geometry,               
              differential equations, algebraic number theory, mathematical                  
              physics ) as groups of symmetries.  Representation theory allows               
              one to take advantage of symmetries in solving problems.                       
                   The work of Professor Mirkovic will have a high degree of                 
              contact with algebra, number theory, and geometry.  Specifically,              
              he will investigate representations of reductive groups defined                
              over finite fields, or the real numbers, or global fields of                   
              positive characteristic, using techniques of D-modules and                     
              perverse sheaves.
