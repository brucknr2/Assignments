Abstract    :
                   The research plan for this project is to develop an                       
              object-oriented model of a building that represents the physical               
              components of the building; the functional and spatial systems of              
              which these physical objects are a part; the tasks performed to                
              construct these components, the timing of these tasks, and the                 
              relationships between these components and tasks (design intent).              
              Although the initial focus is on building modelling, many of the               
              concepts developed here will be equally applicable to other                    
              designed entities, such as railcars.  Such a modelling                         
              environment will provide an information-rich and flexible                      
              foundation on top of which intelligent tools for design, design                
              verification, and construction management can be built.
