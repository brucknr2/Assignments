Abstract    :
                   Professor Goss will work on a number of topics in the                     
              arithmetic of function fields in characteristic p, including:                  
              the cohomology of motives, L-series attached to motives, and                   
              the analogues in this setting of the classical gamma function                  
              and rings of divided power series.                                             
                   This research is work in the Algebraic Geometry of finite                 
              characteristic. Although the field originated with notions of                  
              continuously varying geometric structures like lines and                       
              planes, in this context the Discrete takes over, and methods                   
              akin to those from the theory of whole numbers are most useful.                
              Reciprocally, the algebraic geometry of finite characteristic                  
              is now having great influence on the Theory of Numbers, and is                 
              finding application in Computer Science and Coding Theory.
