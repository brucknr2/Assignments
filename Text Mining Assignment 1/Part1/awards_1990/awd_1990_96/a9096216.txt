Abstract    :
                   This research concerns character sum analogues for                        
              hypergeometric series over finite fields.  The principal                       
              investigator will systematically study an analogue of the Bailey               
              transform in an attempt to derive analogues for higher order                   
              hpergeometric series identities.  He will also study "pseudo"                  
              hypergeometric series, that is, functions which due to the nature              
              of the finite field can not be written as a character sum                      
              hypergeometric series but are closely related.  Also the                       
              principal investigator will investigate the relationship between               
              hypergeometric series and representation theory.                               
                   The purpose of the first two problems is to complete the                  
              theory of hypergeometric series over finite fields and to                      
              increase its computational power as a tool for character sum                   
              evaluation.  The goal of the last problem is to develop an                     
              interplay between the two areas of mathematics, to bring                       
              representation theoretic tools to bear on character sum problems               
              and to determine representation theoretic interpretations for                  
              known character sum identities.
