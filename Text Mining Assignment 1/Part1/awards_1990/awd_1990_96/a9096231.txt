Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Munck is continuing his state of the art Mossbauer and                     
              EPR studies on iron-sulfur proteins.  He is also developing a                  
              spin-coupling Hamiltonian for valence-delocalized systems.                     
              Work performed in the previous grant period has lead to the                    
              recognition that spin-coupling in valence-delocalized systems                  
              requires an additional mechanism, called double-exchange.  in                  
              attempting to buttress the new spin Hamiltonian by                             
              microscopic theory, Dr. Munck discovered a mechanism of                        
              exchange coupling (exchange-transfer).  He plans to now                        
              describe the various states of iron in as much detail as                       
              possible.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Mossbauer and EPR spectroscopy, used in conjunction, with                      
              each other are well suited to elucidate the active site                        
              properties of iron-sulfur clusters.  A variety of iron-sulfur                  
              proteins are being studied, including nitrogenase, an enzyme                   
              system capable of reducing atmospheric nitrogen to                             
              ammonia.***//
