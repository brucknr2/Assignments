Abstract    :
                   It is proposed to address fundamental theoretical questions               
              about the generation of nonclassical optical fields, their                     
              interactions with matter, and methods for conceptualizing and                  
              giving mathematical description to their nonclassical properties.              
              Here the electromagnetic field is viewed as an essentially                     
              statistical quantity.  The hope is to achieve a better                         
              understanding of the conceptual and theoretical interface between              
              the classical and quantum-mechanical worlds.  Areas of work will               
              include (1) intracavity atom-field interactions, (2) single-atom               
              optical bi stability, (3) atomic interactions with nonclassical                
              light, and (4) the theory of nonlinear quantum dissipative                     
              systems
