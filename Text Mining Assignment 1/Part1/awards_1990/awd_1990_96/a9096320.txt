Abstract    :
              This research aims to expand the utility of silanes in synthetic               
              transformations by explaining their use as chiral auxiliaries in a             
              variety of reactions.  The silyl functionality is a versatile one.             
              Not only is it simple to attach to a number of reactive centers but it         
              is quite stable to a variety of reagents and reaction conditions.  The         
              direction of this research can go several directions.  The PI wishes           
              to investigate three of these during the planning period to determine          
              the direction this research program will go and the nature of a MRI            
              competitive proposal.  The three areas are:                                    
                1) In depth study of conformational effects in both chelate and              
                   cyclic models.                                                            
                2) Synthesis of optically active silanes.                                    
                3) Application of silyl auxiliaries in organic reactions.
