Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Northern Illinois University will initiate a 3-week                            
              residential Young Scholars project for 32 students in grades                   
              7-9 in mathematics.  The development and use of mathematical                   
              models in integral to scientific research.  Recent                             
              technological developments have provided new tools for                         
              mathematical modeling including graphing calculators and                       
              microcomputers.  The focus of this project is to familiarize                   
              students with mathematical modeling and its role in many                       
              diverse areas of scientific endeavor.  By exposing students                    
              to a variety of scientists and mathematicians using                            
              mathematical modeling in their work, the project will                          
              stimulate interest in science disciplines as possible and                      
              realistic career choices and make the students aware of the                    
              academic preparation necessary for such careers.  This                         
              project, using the theme of mathematical modeling as an                        
              introduction to experiences in other disciplines, is designed                  
              to do precisely that.  Each cycle of the project, lasting                      
              one year, will consist of a three-week residential camp                        
              during July and August, follow-up activities during the                        
              academic year, and a culminating one-week residential camp                     
              during the following June.
