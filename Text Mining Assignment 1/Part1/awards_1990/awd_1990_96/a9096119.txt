Abstract    :
                   The project's main goal is to study relationships between                 
              the topology of real algebraic varieties and algebro-geometric                 
              properties of these varieties.  It is divided into the following               
              areas of research:  (1) regular mappings (i.e. real algebraic                  
              morphisms) and polynomial mappings, (2) algebraic homology and                 
              cohomology of real algebraic varieties, (3) comparison between                 
              algebraic and topological K-theory of real algebraic varieties.                
              Methods to be applied are the combinations of various techniques               
              of algebraic and differential topology, and algebraic geometry.                
                   As opposed to the more common investigations of algebraic                 
              varieties over the complex numbers or another algebraically                    
              closed field, real algebraic geometry has a more vivid visual                  
              appeal and a much less highly developed and satisfactory theory.               
              On the other hand, applications of real geometry may be more                   
              natural, for example, applications to the motion of robot arms,                
              where the appropriate interpretation of imaginary coordinate                   
              values is ordinarily that the corresponding positions cannot be                
              attained.
