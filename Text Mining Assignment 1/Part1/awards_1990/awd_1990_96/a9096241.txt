Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Presidential Young Investiator award is to support research               
              into protein trafficking of immunologically important molecules.               
              This award will support a promising young investigator/teacher at              
              the University of Texas, Austin.  Experimental approaches to be                
              employed include in vitro mutagenesis/gene transfer, biochemistry              
              and cytology.  Questions being asked include what constitutes a                
              signal for endocytosis of histocompatibility antigens.                         
                                                                                             
              This research has fundamental importance to our understanding of               
              the immune system, especially the role of endocytotic and                      
              exocytotic processes of the plasma membrane and its component                  
              parts on immune function.
