Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  In pelagic systems, the microbial foodweb represents the                  
              primary link for fixed carbon to metazoan food chains, while at                
              the same time a large fraction of phytoplankton production is                  
              respired by microbes.  Recent studies suggest that phagotrophic                
              flagellates less than 5 um are the dominant grazers of                         
              picoplankton, while slightly larger flagellates (5-10 um)                      
              consume both autotrophic and heterotrophic cells less than 5um,                
              and flagellates and ciliates larger than 10 um prey on smaller                 
              flagellates. There is also preliminary data that suggest that                  
              some phagotrophic flagellates may be capable of direct uptake                  
              of high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (DOM). This                  
              research is to examine the sources of nutrition, including DOM,                
              bacteria and cyanobacteria, phytoplankton and colorless                        
              flagellates, as well as the rates of growth, of phagotrophic                   
              flagellates in three size classes of nanoplankton (less than 5                 
              um, 5-10 um, and greater than 10 um) in the open waters of a                   
              salt marsh estuary.
