Abstract    :
              This fellowship award will support study of the Japanese language by           
              an American scientist or engineer by providing a stipend, tuition,             
              and other course-related expenses.  The objectives of the fellowships          
              are to enable active U.S. scientists and engineers to acquire                  
              sufficient familiarity with the language and customs of Japan to               
              allow them to function independently there; or to acquire sufficient           
              expertise in reading Japanese to be able to understand technical               
              abstracts in their field of interest.                                          
                                                                                             
              There is a critical need for more effective technical communication            
              between American and Japanese researchers.  This award is intended to          
              help remove language and cultural barriers to U.S.-Japanese                    
              cooperative research and to facilitate science and technology                  
              exchange.
