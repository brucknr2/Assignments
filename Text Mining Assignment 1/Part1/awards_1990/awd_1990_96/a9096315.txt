Abstract    :
              Chemical synthesis of sialosides, has proven problematic and                   
              the lack of chemical amounts of sialic acid containing                         
              carbohydrate groups has hampered investigations into their                     
              biological roles. This project will exploit the use of purified                
              mammalian sialyltransferases to develop efficient synthesis of                 
              sialosides at a scale not currently possible by chemical                       
              methods alone.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              There are numerous examples of sialosides involved in cellular                 
              recognition.  Sialosides serve as cellular attachment sites                    
              for viruses, mycoplasma, bacteria and bacterial toxins.                        
              Sialylated carbohydrate groups also appear to contain                          
              information important in cell recognition, aspects of cellular                 
              differentiation and development.  Investigation of the                         
              biological roles of sialic acids will be greatly aided by the                  
              availability of pure sialyloligosaccharides and by synthetic                   
              approaches to synthesize additional compounds as desired.
