Abstract    :
                   This project deals with a scientifically and technically                  
              important problem, namely the study on ductile fracture in metal               
              forming processes such as extrusion and forging.  The approach in              
              this project is to consider the shape change of voids and the                  
              progressive loss of strain hardening capability of the matrix                  
              material.  Following that argument, a theoretical framework is                 
              outlined to estimate the average internal void-matrix                          
              configuration of the ductile porous material subjected to                      
              arbitrary three-dimensional finite deformation.  The development               
              of the theory will be buttressed by an experimental program and                
              incorporating it into a finite element program.
