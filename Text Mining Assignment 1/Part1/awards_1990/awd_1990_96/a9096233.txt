Abstract    :
                   This project will examine the importance of ambient                       
              dissolved and intracellular cAMP concentrations, relative to                   
              other physical and chemical factors, in regulating in situ                     
              photosynthetic performance in epilimnetic planktonic assemblages.              
              Experiments conducted in eutrophic Sangre Isle lake will be used               
              to accomplish the following objectives: (1) Develop a                          
              comprehensive seasonal and diel model of in situ cAMP dynamics                 
              in epilimnetic lake water.  These experiments will use both                    
              previously published methods and novel HPLC and monoclonal                     
              antibody techniques to identify the key organisms driving cAMP                 
              dynamics; (2) Test the hypothesis that seasonal and diel                       
              phytoplanktonic PCA rates are influenced by naturally-occurring                
              dissolved or particulate cAMP concentrations; (3) Using the                    
              activated charcoal method for cAMP removal from lake water                     
              developed under previous funding, test the hypothesis that                     
              removal of naturally-occurring cAMP from lake water alter                      
              planktonic PCA rates, and that readdition of cAMP restores PCA                 
              rates to nominal levels; and, (4) Conduct membrane polarity and                
              proton translocation experiments, on planktonic isolates from                  
              Sangre Isle Lake to test the cAMP electrogenic regulation model                
              in natural planktonic assemblages.  These experiments should                   
              determine if cAMP is an important regulator of phytoplankton                   
              production in aquatic systems.
