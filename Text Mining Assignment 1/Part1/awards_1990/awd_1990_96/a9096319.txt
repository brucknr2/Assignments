Abstract    :
                   Many fundamental problems remain for the stable isotopic                  
              analysis of tree rings.  Although the analyses have great                      
              potential for paleoclimatic reconstructions, separating the                    
              various potential causes of isotopic change has been very                      
              difficult.  Stable-carbon isotopic compositions of tree rings may              
              be affected by many parameters, including temperature changes,                 
              growth rate, moisture availability.  The PI proposes to separate               
              these various effects by conducting a series of controlled-growth              
              experiments and by analyzing field samples at sites where                      
              meteorological parameters are continuously monitored.  This                    
              research is important because it will provide the fundamental                  
              relationships between climatic variables and tree-ring carbon                  
              isotopic composition, and it will help to develop this                         
              methodology into a new calibrated tool for paleoclimate                        
              reconstructions.  This proposal has been considered under the                  
              Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.
