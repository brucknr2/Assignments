Abstract    :
                This research is to use tomographic imaging techniques to                    
              determine the subsurface structure beneath Mt. St. Helens at a                 
              very high resolution (on the order of 100 meters).  By the use of              
              5000 previously unused earthquakes, a three dimensional velocity               
              model will be determined which can then be used to improve the                 
              spatial resolution of earthquake locations.  Gravity,                          
              aeromagnetic and attenuation data will be used to constrain the                
              structural solution.  A goal of the work will be to distinguish                
              between conflicting models of the plumbing system for the                      
              transport of magma to the surface.  Because this work has the                  
              potential for increasing the understanding of the interaction of               
              magma transport and seismicity for the major Cascade range                     
              strato-volcanos, it has application to the National Earthquake                 
              Hazard Reduction Program.
