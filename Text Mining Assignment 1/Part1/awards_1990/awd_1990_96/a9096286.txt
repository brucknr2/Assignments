Abstract    :
              This project involves an investigation of the nature and                       
              mechanisms of the diagenesis of carbonate sediment in cores                    
              recovered by the Deep Sea Drilling Project.  The goal is to use                
              petrographic, chemical, and isotopic techniques to determine the               
              degree of modification by diagenesis on the isotopic signature of              
              foraminifera from DSDP and ODP drill cores.  Those isotopic                    
              signatures are used to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental                      
              conditions at the time of deposition at the site and may also                  
              include an overprint from the subsequent diagenesis.  Recognition              
              of samples with this overprint will allow paleoceanographers to                
              reject samples which do not retain an environmental signal so                  
              that reconstructions of paleoclimates recorded in drill cores                  
              will not be in error.
