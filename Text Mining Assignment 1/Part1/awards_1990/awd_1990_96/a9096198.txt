Abstract    :
                      Research will be carried out in theoretical elementary                 
              particle physics.  The work will range from studies which are                  
              close to experiment to development of new theories which may not               
              be immediately testable.  It will include research on superstring              
              theories, which may provide a consistent, unified description of               
              gravity and the other forces.  In particular, the question of how              
              superstrings, which move in ten space-time dimensions, can                     
              properly describe the observed four-dimensional world, will be                 
              explored.  Other work will deal with the unification of the                    
              families of elementary particles, the unification of the forces                
              of nature, and varied topics in quantum field theory.                          
                      The research will be carried out by Jonathan Bagger, a very            
              promising young physicist who has been selected to be one of the               
              new Presidential Young Investigators for 1987.  The work is of                 
              great importance and interest in what is certainly a frontier                  
              area of physics research.
