Abstract    :
              This is a Presidential Young Investigator award which will be                  
              used to study the radiative properties of clouds over a high                   
              latitude snow/ice lower boundary, and to relate the radiative                  
              transfer processes to atmospheric dynamics.  A major objective is              
              to develop a technique for parameterizing clouds and their                     
              radiative properties for numerical weather and climate prediction              
              models, with applications to the seasonal variation in aerosol                 
              concentration in polar regions and to the resulting arctic haze                
              problem.
