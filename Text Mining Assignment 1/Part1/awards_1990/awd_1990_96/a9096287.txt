Abstract    :
                      The geological evolution of the Indian Ocean is the most               
              poorly understood of all the major ocean basins.  In part this                 
              has resulted form diversity of approaches and objectives of the                
              major research cruises in the Indian Ocean.  Both United States                
              and foreign scientists have concentrated on specific tectonic or               
              sedimentary problems, but no major cruises have concentrated on                
              an integrated understanding of its geologic history.  This has                 
              resulted in a wide distributed and non-uniform data base.  A                   
              second problem has been the logistical complexity of supporting                
              U.S. and foreign cruises in the Indian Ocean, resulting in an                  
              overall data base in any country that is insufficient to                       
              adequately address the total history of the ocean basin.                       
                      The objective of the present recommended award is to compile           
              topographic, magnetic and satellite derived gravity field from                 
              the Indian Ocean.  U.S. scientists will work closely with French               
              and Australian researchers to ensure that the data base includes               
              results from the most recent cruises.  These compilations will be              
              used to define (1) the early opening history of the Indian Ocean;              
              (2) the separation of Australia and Antarctica; and (3) the                    
              closing of the seaway between Indonesia and Australia. Paleodepth              
              charts will aid in determining the sedimentary history of the                  
              basins in the Indian Ocean.  The overall compilation will be                   
              important in integrating existing data with the results of                     
              drilling planned by the Ocean Drilling Program.                                
                      This is a coordinated study involving scientists from U.S.             
              and foreign institutions.  Dr. John Sclater of the University of               
              Texas has responsibility for overall coordination of the project.              
              He will be working with Drs. Robert Fisher (Scripps Institution)               
              and Dr. Steven Cande (Lamont-Doherty).  Drs. Roland Sclich                     
              (France), Michael Coffin (Australia) and Hugh Bergh (South                     
              Africa) will provide foreign data.  The principal investigators                
              are highly qualified and funding is strongly recommended at the                
              following levels:
