Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to complete a unified control                
              analysis and design methodology, encompassing both 1-d (one                    
              independent variable, usually time) and n-d (n independent variables)          
              systems, for reduced order controllers that achieve robust performance         
              for linear, uncertain plant models.  In order to derive synthesis              
              methods for n-d systems which are not overly conservative, we will             
              also develop improved analysis techniques (verifying stability,                
              computing norms, etc.) for n-d systems.                                        
                                                                                             
              This approach is significant, because it will tie together many                
              different areas of current control research with a unified theory.  It         
              will lead to algorithms that will increase the role that a control             
              engineer can have in initial system configuration, since the                   
              cost/benefit tradeoffs in component quality and in component modelling         
              can be analyzed apriori.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The entire methodology is based on linear fractional transformations           
              of matrices and a mathematical framework to study them called the              
              structured singular value.  The structured singular value is a                 
              mathematical tool useful in analyzing matrix perturbation problems.
