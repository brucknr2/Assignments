Abstract    :
                   This project is mathematical research sponsored by a                      
              Research at Undergraduate Institutions award.  The subject is                  
              linear operators on Banach spaces, the latter being (generally)                
              infinite-dimensional versions of the finite-dimensional space in               
              which we live.  In general, it is easy for a linear operator to                
              be discontinuous, that is, not to preserve limits; this is a                   
              feature of infinite dimensionality. It is therefore remarkable                 
              that under certain cirumstances, an operator that merely                       
              satisfies a particular algebraic identity turns out automatically              
              to be continuous.  The principal investigator will seek automatic              
              continuity results of this nature within a framework described by              
              the spectral theory of operators.                                              
                   His research will help him provide intellectual leadership                
              to the mathematics department of his institution, Southwest                    
              Missouri State University, thereby improving the environment for               
              undergraduate students seeking to learn mathematics.
