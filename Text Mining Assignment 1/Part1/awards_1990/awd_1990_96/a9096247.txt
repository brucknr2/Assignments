Abstract    :
                  The object of this research is a systematic evaluation of sources          
              and sinks of turbulent kinetic energy in the atmospheric surface               
              layer.  Effects of stability on the normalized terms of the turbulent          
              energy equation (the so-called "phi functions") are being                      
              investigated in a graduated series of comparatively small field                
              experiments.  The particular forms of and the empirical constants in           
              relations for these functions now commonly used to parameterize the            
              lower boundary layer remain uncertain because of contradictory                 
              results of subsequent experiments and incomplete investigation of the          
              effects of stability.                                                          
                  This experiment will measure wind profiles, turbulence spectra,            
              surface thermal energy balances, and Bowen ratios in order to                  
              evaluate the effects of moderate departures from neutrality upon (1)           
              the rates at which turbulence is produced by wind shear and buoyancy,          
              (2) the turbulence dissipation rate, (3) the net rate at which energy          
              is locally gained or lost by the sum of the divergence terms.  To              
              obtain this budget data, additional measurements will be added: the            
              depth of the mixed layer will be monitored acoustically and the                
              vertical turbulent flux of turbulent energy will be measured by two            
              levels by eddy correlation.  All field experiments will be conducted           
              over extensive cropped surfaces of uniform roughness.                          
                  Professor Frenzen is well qualified to make these measurements;            
              he has considerable experience in previous field measurements                  
              especially in the use of his unique low-inertia anemometers.
