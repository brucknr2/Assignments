Abstract    :
                      The Australian-Antarctic Discordance is a unique and                   
              enigmatic bathymetric and geologic  feature of the mid-oceanic                 
              ridge system whose origin is poorly understood. The present award              
              will support an integrated geophysical and geochemical project to              
              study the Discordance  zone. The combination of a comprehensive                
              geochemical investigation with a SeaMARC II side-scan sonar                    
              survey and detailed magnetic and gravity analyses will provide a               
              unique data set which will focus on two problems which are of                  
              fundamental significance, both on a global scale and with respect              
              to the nature of the Discordance itself: (1) the geophysical and               
              geochemical nature of the eastern boundary of the Discordance                  
              which is one of the most pronounced geochemical and bathymetric                
              discontinuities in the global mid-ocean ridge system and (2) the               
              interrelationships among axial depth, axial morphology, ridge                  
              segmentation, and along axis petrologic variations, all of which               
              are unusually variable within and outside the Discordance.                     
                      The study is a cooperative project between scientists at               
              Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, Massachusetts Institute of              
              Technology, and the University of Hawaii. Field work will be done              
              from the R.V. Moana Wave.
