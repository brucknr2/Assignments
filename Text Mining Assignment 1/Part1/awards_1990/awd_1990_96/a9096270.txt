Abstract    :
                   This research has two major components: design theory and                 
              human factors.  In design theory, work will be pursued in the                  
              investigation of formal mathematical structures such as graphs                 
              and lattices.  In human factors, the interface (e.g., task                     
              organization, information presentation and computer capabilities)              
              between the designer and the machine will be examined.                         
                   A computer system that will assist a designer with the                    
              conceptual stages of the design process should be the result of                
              this research.
