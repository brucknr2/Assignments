Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The objectives of this project are: to develop a random-field                  
              model which can represent both long- and short-correlation                     
              structures of an image; to investigate robust estimators in the                
              long- and short-memroy random-field models; and to develop                     
              segmentation and restoration algorithms using theoretical models               
              found in this project.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The long-memory model will be generalized by adding the short-                 
              memory structure of autoregressive moving-average (ARMA)-class                 
              models.  At least two approaches will be used: the input process               
              of the long-memory model will be represented by ARMA models; and               
              the fractional differencing term in the long-memory model will be              
              modified by a fractionally-differenced autoregressive process.                 
              Robust M-estimators will be derived for the estimation of                      
              parameters in generalized  long-memroy models; the objective                   
              function will be derived by metricaly Winsorizing either a                     
              likelihood function  or a least-squares criterion.  Issues                     
              involved with M-estimators, such as scale variance, efficiency at              
              assumed distribution, asymptotic properties, convergence, etc.,                
              will be investigated.  Two-dimensional robust Kalman filters for               
              image restoration, and maximum-likelihood decision rules for                   
              segmentation, will be developed.                                               
                                                                                             
              The performance of model-based vision algorithms is directly                   
              related to the modeling power of the algorithm, and will be                    
              greatly aided by these long- and short-memory models.
