Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Drilling observations in a simple, young igneous system soon                   
              after its emplacement would greatly improve our understanding of               
              magmatic and hydrothermal processes and of the rates at which                  
              such processes operate.  This project is a small piece of a large              
              multi-agency project (NSF, USGS, DOE) involving scientific                     
              drilling in just such a system; the 1912 eruption at Katmai,                   
              Alaska.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Important components of such a large multi-faceted project are                 
              planning, coordination, and synthesis of results.  The Principal               
              Investigator of this project will have a large part of this                    
              responsibility.  This award provides funds to begin these tasks;               
              specifically to visit the proposed drill sites to assess working               
              conditions and complete design of the operations and to collect                
              and analyze samples for characterization of the mineralogy.
