Abstract    :
              Professor Blakemore plans to continue his studies of deep level                
              flaws in semiconducting crystalline compounds.  These                          
              investigations will include both modelling of the properties of                
              the flaws arising from impurities, defects and complexes and                   
              electrical and optical characterization experiments.  He is an                 
              internationally recognized authority on deep-level flaws in                    
              crystalline semiconductors.  This work is very important for the               
              fundamental understanding of the properties of these materials                 
              and for the characterization of materials for device                           
              applications.
