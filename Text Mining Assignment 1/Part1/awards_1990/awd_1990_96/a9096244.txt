Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In his proposed experimental plan, Dr. Faull intends to use the                
              techniques of in vivo voltammetry and intracerebral microdialysis              
              to test three specific hypotheses concerning biogenic amine and                
              neuropetide release phenomena.  These hypotheses concern the                   
              proposed interactions between dopamine, cholecystokinin and                    
              neurotensin in mesocorticolimibic and basal ganglia brain                      
              regions, and the proposed interactions between dopamine and                    
              acetylcholine in the nigrostriatal pathway.  The in vivo                       
              techniques will be used in conjunction with microbore high-                    
              performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical                   
              detection and combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for                
              quantification of biogenic amines and their metabolites, and                   
              radioimmunoassay for quantification of the neuropeptides.  By                  
              using sophisticated analytical and radioimmunochemical                         
              techniques, the proposal of the newly developed in vivo                        
              techniques will be extended to important areas of the behavioral               
              and neural sciences and could have a significant impact on                     
              understanding of the integration of neurotransmitter release in                
              specific brain areas.
