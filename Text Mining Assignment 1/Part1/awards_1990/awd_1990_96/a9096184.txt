Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award partially supports acquisition of a microscope and image            
              processing system.  The instrument will be used in studies of cell and         
              cell fragment capture by fluidized particles within a magnetically             
              stabilized fluidized bed.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The research should help improve some separations processes relevant           
              to biochemical processes.
