Abstract    :
              A long range goal of this research is to identify the important                
              mechanisms that are involved in fat deposition and subsequent                  
              composition.  Hibernating mammals were selected for study because they         
              must deposit large amounts of fat to meet cellular energy requirements         
              during the winter months.  Since they eat little or nothing during             
              hibernation, they must store energy in the form of fat in their body.          
              It is hoped that these studies will lead to a better understanding of          
              the role of certain essential fatty acids in basic nutrition,                  
              reproduction, and hibernation.
