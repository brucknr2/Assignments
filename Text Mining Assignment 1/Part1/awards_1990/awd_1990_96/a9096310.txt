Abstract    :
              This proposal will continue a comparative study of the population              
              biology and ecology of Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins at               
              Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South shetland Islands, Antarctica          
              (62 10'S, 58 30'W).  The primary objective is to determine age-specific        
              demographic parameters for sympatric populations of Pygoscelis penguins,       
              and to compare these parameters between Adelie populations in different        
              environments.  Another objective is to compare the foraging                    
              behavior/ecology of the three species, and within each, to compare the         
              feeding proficiency of young, inexperienced, firts-time breeders with          
              older, established breeders.  Results from the latter effort should help       
              to explain patterns observed in the demographic data.  Pygoscelis              
              penguins are major predators of krill (Euphausia superba); these               
              predators and their prey are major components of the antarctic marine          
              food web.  To thoroughly understand the structure and function of the          
              Antarctic ecosystem, important information not yet available would be          
              the factors that drive age structure and regulate population size of key       
              trophic-level predators (penguins).  Such information will result from         
              the proposed study.
