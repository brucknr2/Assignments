Abstract    :
                   The region of the atmosphere known as the lower thermosphere              
              (80 to 130 km in altitude) is more difficult to study than the                 
              regions at higher altitudes accessible to satellites and regions               
              at lower altitudes accessible to balloons and aircraft.  The high              
              altitude energy inputs of the solar wind and solar ultraviolet                 
              propagate downward through it, and the lower altitude tidal and                
              gravity wave energy inputs propagate upward through it, both                   
              depositing some of their energy on the way.  To understand the                 
              coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere we must                        
              understand the structure and dynamics of the lower thermosphere                
              and how it affects the energy propagating through it.  High                    
              latitude studies are especially important in view of auroral                   
              energy sources.  Two incoherent scatter radars in Alaska and                   
              Sweden have made extensive measurements over the last solar cycle              
              that can be analyzed to yield the temperatures and winds and                   
              their variation with season, magnetic activity and solar cycle.
