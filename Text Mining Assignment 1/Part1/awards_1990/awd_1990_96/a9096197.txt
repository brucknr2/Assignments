Abstract    :
              This project is in the area of the Materials Chemistry                         
              Initiative.  The investigators will examine the chemical vapor                 
              deposition of thin films of metal nitrides of Al, Ga, In, Mo,                  
              and Nb using new organometallic precursors.  Unlike previous                   
              routes, which employed Nitrogen or Ammonia as the source of the                
              nitrogen, the precursors will make use of reactive nitrogen                    
              moieties such as azide.  For instance, preliminary results have                
              shown that diethylaluminum azide deposits an aluminum nitride                  
              thin film at 400 degrees C.  It is intended that such species                  
              will lead to the nitride films at lower temperatures with                      
              greater selectivity, and their plans include the use of                        
              laser-and plasma-induced depositions along with the thermally                  
              activated processes.  The relationship between the structure of                
              the precursor and the structure and properties of the film will                
              be explored in detail.  A specially designed reactor will be                   
              used to detect reactive intermediates in the gas phase by mass                 
              spectrometry.  These studies along with the evaluation of the                  
              overall rate of deposition will lead to a better understanding                 
              of the relationship between the mechanism of reaction and the                  
              properties of the thin film.
