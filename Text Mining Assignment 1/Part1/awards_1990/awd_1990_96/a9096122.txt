Abstract    :
              In his initial research, Dr. Pangrle found more powerful models                
              and new insights upon which to base a high-level synthesis                     
              system.  His goal is to develop a design automation system which               
              will synthesize optimized designs based on the user's behavioral               
              description and design level constraints.  This research concerns              
              two issues in high-level digital design synthesis:  behavioral                 
              description languages and design generation.  His component model              
              serves as a unifying thread that will influence the development                
              of the entire system from the bottom up.  Research on the                      
              behavioral description language and its compiler incorporates a                
              new flow-graph model based on the component model.  Research on                
              the design generator involves development of new algorithms for                
              allocation of operations in the flow-graph, and for a                          
              connectivity binder that binds components to the flow-graph.
