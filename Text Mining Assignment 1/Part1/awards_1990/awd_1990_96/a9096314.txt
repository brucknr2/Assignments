Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of low molecular weight carbonyl compounds                
              in sea water.  These compounds are important because they are                  
              involved in many biotic and abiotic processes in the ocean,                    
              including photochemical transformations in the surface water,                  
              air-sea exchange, condensation reactions, surface microlayer                   
              enrichment and microbial transformations.  The research will be                
              focused on laboratory investigations designed to facilitate                    
              interpretation of the project's past field work.  These                        
              investigations will include experiments on photochemical reaction              
              pathways, action spectra, reactants, and oxidants.  In these                   
              experiments low molecular weight carbonyl compounds will be used               
              as chemical probes.  In addition to this laboratory work, a model              
              of the carbonyl distribution in the upper mixed layer will be                  
              developed and tested.
