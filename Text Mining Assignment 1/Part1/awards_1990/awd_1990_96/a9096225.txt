Abstract    :
              The research is to determine the applicability of pH monitoring                
              to concrete materials manufacture and production.  There are two               
              parts, The first part involves pH monitoring of the chemical                   
              reaction between water and Portland cement.  The objective of                  
              this part is to determine the rate of change of the pH and the                 
              characteristic data as a new means to classify cement types.  The              
              second phase consists of monitoring the change of the pH in                    
              concrete that utilizes Portland cement; changes in pH are to be                
              observed when variables are altered individually.  This project                
              is one supported under the Creativity Awards for Engineering                   
              Students.
