Abstract    :
                      The researchers propose to continue studying the low-                  
              latitude ionosphere and thermosphere during magnetically quiet                 
              and disturbed periods.  They will use the NCAR TGCM, our                       
              ionosphere model and satellite data in their effort to understand              
              the basic processes that govern the behavior of these regions.                 
              The model predictions will be compared to available data in order              
              to study the effects of winds, tides, and electric fields on the               
              low latitude ionosphere.  They will investigate the effects near               
              the equator of the high latitude energy source, as occurs during               
              a magnetic disturbance, as well as the presence of low latitude                
              energy sources, such as neutral particle precipitation.                        
                      The dynamics of the ionosphere and thermosphere are of                 
              interest since it is in this region (above 150 km altitude) that               
              radio waves propagate for long distances for ground to ground                  
              communication, and for ground to satellite communication.  The                 
              winds, tides and electric fields, have important effects on                    
              ionospheric structure and hence on the quality and reliability of              
              such communication.
