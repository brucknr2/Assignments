Abstract    :
              The objective of this work is to develop a short-term (in the                  
              order of days) ice hazard warning system for shallow, partially                
              ice-covered waters.  This system will vastly improve the present               
              capability of accurately predicting the movement of individual                 
              ice floes, while retaining sufficient numerical efficiency so as               
              to facilitate its use on small, e.g., shipborne, computers.                    
                                                                                             
              The formulation of this system will couple the ice floe motion                 
              and the underlying water circulation, and will apply the                       
              Eulerian-Lagrangian concept of transport modelling to ice drift                
              prediction.  A detailed investigation of the range and variation               
              of the drag coefficients at the ice surface and bottom will be                 
              carried out as well, so as to establish guidelines for estimating              
              these coefficients under a variety of environmental conditions                 
              and for a range of ice floe characteristics.
