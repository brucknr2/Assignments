Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with developing a theory of relative                 
              structure for abelian groups. The approach is through a series of              
              equivalence theorems. The principal investigator will concentrate              
              on Butler groups and global Warfield groups. In particular, the                
              research will focus on establishing an equivalence theorem for                 
              arbitrary pure subgroups of completely decomposable groups.                    
                   This project is in the general area of abelian group theory               
              and is concerned with the classification of abelian groups.                    
              Although the classification of finite abelian groups has been                  
              well understood for a century, the classification of infinite                  
              abelian groups remains elusive. This research involves this old                
              problem of classification of the infinite abelian groups,                      
              approached by new tools from logic and analysis.
