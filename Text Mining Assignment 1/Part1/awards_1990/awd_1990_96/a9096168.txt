Abstract    :
              8901273                                                                         
                  Mischaikow is developing an approach to studying the                      
              structure of isolated invariant sets which is applicable to a                  
              wide variety of problems, e.g. symmetric systems, travelling                   
              waves for reaction - diffusion systems, dynamic phase                          
              transitions, magnetohydrodynamic shock waves, delay equations,                 
              predator-prey models, to name a few.  More specifically                        
              Mischaikow is concerned with deriving algebraic invariants                     
              which describe invariant set, determining how they can change                  
              through bifurcations, and determining which geometric                          
              structures are imposed on the invariant sets by the algebraic                  
              invariants.  The guiding philosophy in this development comes                  
              from the fact that many differential equations that arise as                   
              models of biological, chemical, or physical systems share the                  
              following three characteristics:   (1) they are derived from                   
              idealized descriptions of complicated phenomena, (2) they are                  
              parameterized systems and the exact values of the parameters                   
              are not known,  and (3) they are non-linear.  Thus, from an                    
              applied point of view describing the global and robust                         
              structures of the solutions to these differential equations is                 
              of great importance.                                                           
                   Mischaikow's research makes extensive use of the Conley                   
              index and, in particular, of a relatively new tool called the                  
              connection matrix.
