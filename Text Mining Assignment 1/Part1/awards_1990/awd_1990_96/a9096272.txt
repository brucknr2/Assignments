Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Professor James L. Skinner is supported by a grant from The                    
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop                     
              theoretical models which will assist chemists in interpreting                  
              experimental spectroscopic data for liquids.  Skinner will                     
              develop theories for interpreting relaxation rates for chemical                
              processes occuring in liquids which may be studied using                       
              experimental spectroscopic techniques such as NMR, ESR,                        
              vibrational and optical spectroscopy.                                          
                                                                                             
              Skinner will perform theoretical research in three general                     
              areas of statistical mechanics: 1) He will develop stochastic                  
              models for describing population and phase relaxation observed                 
              in NMR, ESR, vibrational and optical spectroscopy; 2) He will                  
              develop a theory to deal with lineshapes of optical                            
              spectroscopically measured impurities in the liquid phase; and                 
              3) He will use a new approach which he has named quantum-                      
              connectivity- renormalization-theory to study localization in                  
              models with liquid-like order.
