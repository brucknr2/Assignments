Abstract    :
              Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) plays a central role in the                
              hopothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.  Despite nearly twenty years              
              of work, virtually nothing is known about the regulation of TRH                
              production.  Dr. Goodman and collaborators propose to use a                    
              recently isolated TRH cDNA and TRH-producing cell line to                      
              characterize the factors and mechanisms that underlie TRH                      
              biosynthesis.  He will use intact animals to compare TRH-like                  
              mRNAs in discrete brain regions and a rat cell line to identify                
              agents that affect TRH biosynthesis and secretion.  He will also               
              test whether the TRH precursor can generate peptides in addition               
              to TRH that affect pituitary function.  Finally, he will use the               
              TRH-producing cell line to identify the components of the TRH                  
              gene that are important for regulated and tissue-specific                      
              expression.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Elucidation of the factors and mechanisms that control TRH                     
              biosynthesis and secretion would greatly increase our                          
              understanding of how the brain regulates endocrine function.
