Abstract    :
              McMurdo Sound is representative of large areas of the Southern Ocean           
              which are seasonally or permanently covered by sea-ice.  Inputs of             
              microalgal carbon into McMurdo Sound are seasonally episodic and appear        
              to be strongly influenced by inputs from sea ice microbial communities         
              and advection from the Ross Sea.  The hypothesis of this project is that       
              the trophic role of nano- and microzooplankton reflects the episodic           
              nature of primary production in this system.  Using McMurdo Sound as a         
              study site, the research will examine seasonal and spatial variation in:       
              1)  the distribution of nano- (2-20 um) and micro- (20-200 um)                 
              zooplankton, microalgae and bacteria.  2)  growth rates of                     
              microzooplankton.  3)  grazing impact of nano- and microzooplankton            
              communities on algae and bacteria.                                             
                                                                                             
              Dominant bactivores in this system will be identified and the use of           
              dissolved free amino acids and detritus as nutritional sources for             
              individual microzooplankton species evaluated.  Results of this study          
              will improve the understanding of the role of microbial food webs in the       
              cycling of carbon in ice-covered regions of the Southern Ocean.
