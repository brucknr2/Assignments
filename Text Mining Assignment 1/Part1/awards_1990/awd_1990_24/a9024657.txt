Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                 
              program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Friesner will                     
              continue his development of highly efficient numerical                         
              techniques, called pseudospectral methods, for the prediction                  
              of microscopic properties of molecules.                                        
                                                                                             
              Improvements of the Hartree-Fock and Generalized Valence Bond                  
              methods will be carried out, as will extensions to analytic                    
              first and second derivatives of these wave functions with                      
              respect to the geometric positions. Two pseudospectral                         
              algorithms for treating short range electron correlation,                      
              second order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory and variational                
              Monte Carlo methods, will be explored. Subsequent work will                    
              include the exploration of a wide range of alternative                         
              correlation methods.
