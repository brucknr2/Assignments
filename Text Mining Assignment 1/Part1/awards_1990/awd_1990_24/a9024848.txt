Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project seeks to achieve a fundamental understanding of                   
              diffusion mechanisms in gallium arsenide.  Specific goals are to               
              determine: 1)the dominant point defects controlling diffusion on               
              each sublattice, 2)the corresponding charge states, and 3)the                  
              causes of anomalous enhancements in diffusion at high dopant                   
              concentrations.  Controlled Fermi level and arsenic overpressure               
              will be used to obtain diffusion coefficients, and to identify the             
              dominant point defects associated with diffusion.  In n-type                   
              Gallium Arsenide, the results are expected to link the coincident              
              observations of electron concentration saturation, group III                   
              diffusivity saturation, and changes in the group VI solubility.  In            
              p-type Gallium Arsenide, the results are expected to link the                  
              mechanisms controlling group II and III diffusion, particularly at             
              high acceptor concentrations.  New qualitative and quantitative                
              understanding of fundamental processes important to diffusion                  
              mechanisms in compound semiconductors is anticipated from this                 
              project; the results also have technological relevance to the                  
              microelectronics industry.
