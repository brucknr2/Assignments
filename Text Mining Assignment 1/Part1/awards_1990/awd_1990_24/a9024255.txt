Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this research is to study superplastic flow in               
              fine grained metallic alloys. In particular, the effects of                    
              impurity atom segregation at the grain boundaries on creep and                 
              cavitation in Zn-22%Al and Pb-62%Sn will be investigated. Special              
              attention will be given to delineating the mechanisms responsible              
              for the observed creep stress threshold, and to determining the                
              relationship between deformation and cavity growth in fine grain               
              alloys. It is anticipated that the results of this research program            
              will enhance the understanding of the role of impurity atoms in the            
              deformation, formability, and fracture of superplastic alloys.
