Abstract    :
              This research involves the use of metal stabilized                             
              vinylcarbenoids as reactive intermediates in organic synthesis                 
              with three specific aims. First is the development of                          
              asymmetric synthesis with vinyl carbenoids using                               
              (-)-pantolactone and related systems as inexpensive chiral                     
              auxilaries. Second is the synthesis of phorbol analogues using                 
              the tandem cyclopropanation/Cope rearrangement sequence. The                   
              third area is the study of novel annulation reactions based on                 
              preliminary observations which have shown unusual reactivity at                
              the vinyl terminus of monosubstituted vinylcarbenoids                          
              containing an electron withdrawing group.                                      
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                 
              Division will support the research of Dr. Huw M.L. Davies of                   
              the Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest University. The                     
              research involves the use of metal stabilized vinylcarbenoids                  
              as reactive intermediates in organic synthesis. These                          
              intriguing and fascinating species will be used to development                 
              asymmetric synthetic methodology. Their utility will be                        
              demonstrated in the synthesis of several natural products or                   
              analogues.
