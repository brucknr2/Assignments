Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The synthesis and characterization of novel metal sulfide framework            
              compounds will be undertaken using innovative hydrothermal                     
              synthetic techniques.  This investigation will include the use of              
              these framework compounds as host materials to stabilize small                 
              clusters, and clusters with unusual geometries.
