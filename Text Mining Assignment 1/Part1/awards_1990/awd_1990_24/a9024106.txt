Abstract    :
              Very little is known about the evolution of Arctic ringed seals,               
              in particular, ecological constraints on social organization and               
              foraging strategies.  These most northern ice-adapted seals live               
              and breed in the fast ice, an environment that usually restricts               
              learning about their ecology and behavior.  But, because of their              
              habitat, ringed seals are also constrained to forage within the                
              range of their breath-hold from a fixed breathing hold.  Dr.                   
              Wartzok proposes to investigate aspects of social organization,                
              diving behavior and foraging patterns of these seals.  Dr.                     
              Wartzok who recently developed a electronic tracking system will               
              follow the movements of ringed seals as they interact and forage               
              under the ice.  Seals, captured at their breathing holes using a               
              triggered pursing net, will have acoustic pingers and radio                    
              frequency transmitters glued to their fur and then released.                   
              Continuous data will be recorded on their under-ice movements and              
              their use of breathing holes and lairs.  The data will be used to              
              evaluate hypotheses concerning territoriality, territory size,                 
              sharing of breathing holes, role of vocalizations in territory                 
              maintenance, diving patterns, and presumed foraging activities                 
              including depths and diurnal patterns.  This study should                      
              contribute significantly to our understanding of the social                    
              organization and foraging strategies of ringed seals.
