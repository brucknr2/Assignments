Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Leiba Rodman of the College of                   
              William and Mary to continue a highly productive collaboration in              
              mathematics with Professors A. C. M. Ran, M. A. Kaashoek, and                  
              I. Gohberg, of the Vrije University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.               
              They are working together on several interrelated research topics              
              in the general area of systems and control.  The common theme is a             
              study of invariant subspaces of matrices, rational matrix valued               
              functions and the interrelations between them.  More specifically,             
              the proposed research problems include perturbation analysis of                
              invariant spaces, symmetric factorization and interpolation of                 
              symmetric rational matrix functions, and minimal factorizations of             
              real skew-symmetric rational matrix functions.                                 
                                                                                             
              The proposed work is in a highly active area of mathematics                    
              involving linear algebra and classical operator theory.  Results               
              will lead to a better understanding of invariant subspaces of                  
              matrices (both general and special classes) and of several                     
              interpolation and factorization problems for self-adjoint and                  
              skew-symmetric matrix functions.  These two topics are interrelated,           
              and comprise an important part of the ongoing research of a                    
              developing field of mathematics inspired by and applied to modern              
              electrical engineering.
