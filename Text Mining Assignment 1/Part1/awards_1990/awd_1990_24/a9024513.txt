Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                Professor Lim is supported by a grant from the Experimental                 
              Physical Chemistry Program to study the structure and spectra                  
              of van der Waals dimers, excimers, and bicimers (doubly                        
              excited) of aromatic hydrocarbons for the purpose of deducing                  
              the dependence of the structure on the nature of the electronic                
              state.  Experimental techniques will include time- and                         
              energy-resolved spectra in absorption and/or emission. A                       
              comparison of these intermolecular dimers with the                             
              corresponding diaryl alkanes which are their intramolecular                    
              dimer counterparts will provide spectral and temporal                          
              characteristics from which can be deduced structural features                  
              and energetics of vibronic transitions for the three classes of                
              molecular dimers.  Theoretical studies of the two interacting                  
              molecules as a function of their relative orientation will be                  
              combined with the experimental studies for a detailed                          
              characterization of these species.

              The combination of experimental and theoretical approaches is                  
              expected to lead to an understanding of the dependence of the                  
              structure of the dimers on the nature of the electronic state                  
              of the hydrocarbon and contribute to our understanding of                      
              energy flow in these systems and the intermolecular forces that                
              hold the pair of molecules together.
