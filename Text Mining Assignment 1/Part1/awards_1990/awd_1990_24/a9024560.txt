Abstract    :
              The high polar latitudes are amongst the most sensitive to                     
              climatic changes.  In the summer of 1991 an international                      
              team of three ice-breakers will depart on a 70 day                             
              expedition to explore and sample the largely unknown eastern                   
              sector of the central Arctic.  This award will support the                     
              collection of upwards of 90 sediment cores to provide the                      
              scientific community with the first major collection of core                   
              materials from the interior of this ocean basin.  In                           
              addition, the type of materials to be collected (i.e.                          
              boxcores, giant gravity cores, and large diameter piston                       
              cores) are designed to overcome the poor coretop recovery                      
              and very narrow core diameter limitations present in the                       
              existing cores.  This research will focus on Arctic Ocean                      
              sediments deposited during the last 25,000 years to address                    
              questions of the temporal and geographic variability in the                    
              stable isotopic signature of Arctic surface waters and the                     
              response of the central Arctic Ocean to mid-Holocene warming                   
              (i.e. Hypsithermal).  This work will also help to define the                   
              extent and disintegration pattern of the late Weichselian                      
              Ice Sheets in the Eurasian Arctic.
