Abstract    :
              Professor Paul Barbara is supported by a grant from the                        
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the Organic                
              Dynamics Program to conduct a Conference on Photoinduced Proton                
              Transfer in Chemistry, Biology and Physics.                                    
                                                                                             
              The conference, which will honor the many contributions of                     
              Michael Kasha, will be held in Tallahassee, Florida on January                 
              6-9, 1991.   It is expected that over 100 participants will                    
              attend.  Funds provided through this grant will primarily be                   
              used to support travel grants for postdoctoral research                        
              associates and young assistant professors.
