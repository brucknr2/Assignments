              will be on extreme winds, floods,                                              
              earthquakes, landslides, other ground                                          
              failures, and volcanoes.  The EMNHD-2 will be                                  
              one of the many activities taking place                                        
              during the International Decade for Natural                                    
              Disasters Reduction (IDNDR) that emphasizes                                    
              the need for national, regional and                                            
              international efforts for diminishing life                                     
              and economic losses, and for mitigating the                                    
              damages produced by natural extreme events.

              natural hazards problems, engineering                                          
              research and practice addressing these                                         
              problems, research needs, transfer of                                          
              knowledge, and possible cooperative projects                                   
              between the United States and the Asian                                        
              Countries.  Proceedings of the conference
