Abstract    :
              This small grant will provide for pilot testing, preparation of                
              instruments, and consultations among principal investigators for               
              renewal and extension of the investigators' prior NSF-supported                
              study on rule systems in Japanese and American schools.  The aim               
              of the new research is to expand and refine the study of                       
              socialization into rule systems in Japan and the United States by              
              focusing on children's development of a sense of obligation.  This             
              planning grant will constitute the initial stages of a major                   
              project.  The anticipated design calls for exploration of                      
              developmental and cultural differences in the sense of obligation              
              to either follow the established rules and norms or adhere to one's            
              own internalized values.  This grant will also provide support for             
              an undergraduate student, under the Research Experience for                    
              Undergraduates (REU) Program, to work on the development stages of             
              a potential large-scale, cross-cultural study.                                 
                                                                                             
              This research promises to continue the investigators' previous                 
              successful line of research on legal socialization and classroom               
              motivation.  How rule systems develop and function and produce                 
              different patterns of conduct and accomplishment in Japanese and               
              American youths has profound implications for understanding not                
              only law-abiding behavior in citizens but also achievement and                 
              academic motivation in youth.
