Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support to the IVth                       
              Conference on the Intersections between Particle and Nuclear                   
              Physics, Tucson, Arizona, 5/23-29/91.                                          
                   The conference will bring together particle and nuclear                   
              physicists to discuss the entire range of topics in the energy                 
              domain of 1 to 100 GeV.  The discussions will include heavy                    
              ion physics as component of particle physics, electrons as                     
              probes of particle physics within the nucleus, rare decays of                  
              mesons, deep inelastic scattering of muons.  The conference                    
              will serve to improve the communication among people working                   
              on similar projects and enhance the exploitation of present                    
              and future facilities.
