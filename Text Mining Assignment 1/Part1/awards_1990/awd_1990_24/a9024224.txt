Abstract    :
              This project deals with the development of systems which use                   
              acoustic signals to monitor the performance of equipment.  There               
              is a wide variety of potential applications for such acoustic                  
              monitoring systems.  As  sensors and computer hardware become                  
              smaller and less expensive, all manner of machines and structures              
              could be provided with "nerve systems" to assess their health.                 
              This project involves three phases, comprising 1) modeling of                  
              acoustic systems, 2) data acquisition and signal processing, and               
              3) system identification.  The system envisioned ultimately will               
              consist of an acoustic excitation, a transmission path, one or                 
              more receivers, and hardware for signal processing and                         
              computation.  The monitoring of beams for cracks will be                       
              considered as a specific example.
