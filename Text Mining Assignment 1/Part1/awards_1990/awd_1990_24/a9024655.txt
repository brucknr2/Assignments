Abstract    :
              An existing Monte Carlo electron transport code                                
              (WETRAN) will be extended into a time dependent                                
              low energy three dimensional transport code.  The                              
              code must also be extended so it can transport                                 
              electrons in semiconductor elements other than                                 
              silicon, and composite semiconductor materials.  A                             
              revised routine to describe secondary Auger                                    
              production will be written.  Extension to vector and                           
              multitasking machines will be studied.  The code                               
              will require extensive electron differential and total                         
              cross section data bases. The data base will be used                           
              to predict the energy dependent probabilities for                              
              various events which can occur during the transport                            
              process.  Elastic cross sections will be computed                              
              using the optical model, preliminary inelastic core                            
              ionizations by the Coulomb-Born approximation,                                 
              and valence excitations using the dielectric function                          
              method which includes electron-hole, and plasmon                               
              excitations.
