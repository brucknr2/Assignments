Abstract    :
                   The National Science Foundation (NSF) is responsible for                  
              fostering, promoting and facilitating communication and                        
              collaboration among members of the U. S. scientific research and               
              education community as well as with their colleagues abroad.  The              
              objective of the International Connections Project is to provide               
              integrated management of international data networking                         
              connections between the NSFNET and the national research and                   
              academic networks of countries with which the U.S. community                   
              maintains scientific collaborations.  Coordinated and                          
              consolidated management of the U.S. side of the interconnections               
              is expected to achieve more efficient and cost-effective                       
              networking solutions.  Initially, the award focuses on links to                
              INRIA (France) and to NORDUnet (Nordic countries), because NSF                 
              has been the sole U.S. agency operating general research                       
              interconnections with those countries.
