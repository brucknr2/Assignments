Abstract    :
              Leguminosae (Fabaceae) is the third largest family of flowering                
              plants and includes many ecologically and economically important               
              species.  The primary goal of the PI's research program has been               
              a unified summary of the family of the U.S.  Only the genus                    
              Lupinus, the widespread and complex lupines, has not been                      
              completed.  This proposal is to examine herbarium holdings to                  
              complete a monographic revision of the genus.  The monograph will              
              have widespread use by range managers, foresters, and                          
              conservationists.
