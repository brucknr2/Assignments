Abstract    :
              Dr. Chandler is investigating the control of gene expression in                
              different cell types and at different developmental stages, by                 
              studying the regulated expression of the genes required for                    
              anthocyanin biosynthesis in maize.  The long term goals are to                 
              understand how the regulatory gene, B coordinately regulates the               
              pathway in a tissue-and developmental-specific manner and to                   
              determine the molecular mechanisms of B paramutation.                          
                                                                                             
              This proposal fulfills the FAW objectives which are 1) to recognize            
              outstanding and promising women scientists and engineers in                    
              academic careers of research and teaching and 2) to facilitate the             
              further development of their careers.***//
