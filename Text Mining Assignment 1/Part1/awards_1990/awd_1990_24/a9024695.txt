Abstract    :
              This project is part of an integrated research program into the                
              oceanographic structure of the western Weddell Sea.  It is to be               
              carried out from an ice camp jointly occupied by U.S. and USSR                 
              scientists from February to June 1992.  The work proposed here is              
              an effort to measure vertical profiles of velocity and                         
              temperature using an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP)                  
              and a string of twelve internally recording temperature sensors,               
              as well as a Rapid Sampling Vertical Profiler, a tethered sensor               
              system that free falls through the upper 250 meters of the ocean.              
              The upper ocean is a relatively active zone where turbulent                    
              motion is produced both by shear flow and by the movement of sea               
              ice through the water.  The objective is to study how turbulent                
              energy is created and destroyed by the exchange of momentum and                
              energy across density surfaces in the upper mixed layer, by shear              
              induced mixing, and by the differential diffusion of heat and                  
              salt.  The frequent and quasi-continuous current profiles                      
              produced by the ADCP will be used to define the internal gravity               
              wave field, and how gravity waves are affected by the bottom                   
              topography.  When supplemented by information on the regional                  
              temperature structure of the upper ocean, the observations will                
              allow a separation of the barotropic and baroclinic component of               
              the surface currents.
