Abstract    :
                   This project will study singular perturbation problems, fully             
              nonlinear first-and-second-order pde's and control theory,                     
              mechanics (porous-medium equation), and nonlinear waves.  A large              
              class of singular perturbation problems related to                             
              reaction-diffusion equations or systems which model physical,                  
              chemical and biological phenomena, in which fronts develop                     
              naturally for large times will be considered.  A class of                      
              singular perturbations related to gas kinetics and radiative                   
              transfer equations will be studied from the point of view of a new             
              methodology introduced by the PI.  Fully nonlinear pde's and their             
              relations to control theory and differential games, questions                  
              related to the theory of porous-medium equations, the stability of             
              waves in fluids,  and the singularities of the nonlinear                       
              Schrodinger equation will be encompassed. These studies find                   
              applications in topics such as flame propagation, phase                        
              transitions, and evolution of populations.
