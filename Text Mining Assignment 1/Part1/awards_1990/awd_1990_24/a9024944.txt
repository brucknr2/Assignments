Abstract    :
              Optimization can contribute significantly both to on-                          
              line control and to the design of linear and nonlinear                         
              controllers.  In the form of receding horizon control,                         
              it has the potential, not easily provided by other                             
              methods, to stabilize linear and nonlinear systems                             
              with state and control constraints.  When employed                             
              in an interactive, optimization-based design                                   
              environment, it enables control systems to be                                  
              designed to achieve the diverse, possibly conflicting,                         
              objectives that typify engineering design.                                     
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this research is twofold.  Firstly, it                          
              will endeavour to provide a firm basis for the use of                          
              receding horizon control by a comprehensive program                            
              of research aimed at:  (i) reducing substantially the                          
              on-line computational demands made by existing,                                
              stabilizing receding horizon controllers, (ii)                                 
              developing receding horizon observers for use when                             
              the state is not accessible, (iii) developing adaptive                         
              receding horizon control for the case when the plant                           
              is unknown, and (iv) exploring the use of                                      
              optimization-based design to achieve these objectives.                         
                                                                                             
              Secondly, it aims to improve computational tools for                           
              optimization-based design by research on:  (i) semi-                           
              infinite optimization, (ii) global optimization, (iii)                         
              semi-infinite global optimization, and, (iv) simple,                           
              robust optimal control algorithms for use in receding                          
              horizon control.
