Abstract    :
              A study of the spin-casting process is to continued under a                    
              renewal grant.  The research consists of both modeling and                     
              casting experiments.  Modeling is focused on the interplay                     
              between melt flow, temperature, and solidification.  The                       
              experiments are aimed at further defining optimal operating                    
              parameters for the production of smoothly textured thin sheets                 
              of specialized materials.                                                      
              This research will advance the ability to cast rapidly                         
              quenched materials with controlled nanostructures.  Examples                   
              are permanent magnet materials, high temperature alloys, and                   
              also superconducting microcomposites.
