Abstract    :
              This is a one-year pilot project to investigate the integration of             
              parallel numeric and symbolic computation techniques.  It will consist         
              of the following steps:                                                        
                                                                                             
              o  Establish the importance of parallel processing of computer algebra         
                 by experiments with finite element problems.                                
                                                                                             
              o  Establish the potential of emerging automatic parallelization               
                 technology to speed computer algebra by experimentation with kernel         
                 algorithms for computer algebra.                                            
                                                                                             
              o  Establish the potential for parallelization of mixed                        
                 symbolic/numeric computations by experimentation with sparse                
                 matrix kernels.
