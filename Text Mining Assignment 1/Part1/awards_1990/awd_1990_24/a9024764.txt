Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              include studies of the manner in which the angular momentum of                 
              a nucleon is divided among the constituents of the nucleon,                    
              analyses of possible signals of a light Higgs particle (whose                  
              discovery would provide important information on the origin of                 
              mass), investigations of the physics behind the confinement of                 
              quarks within nucleons, and an extremely precise calculation                   
              of the magnetic dipole moment of an electron.  The sharing of                  
              the angular momentum of a nucleon among its constituents has                   
              been made very puzzling by recent data.  Questions relating to                 
              the origin of mass or the confinement of quarks are of central                 
              importance in our attempt to understand the elementary                         
              particles.
