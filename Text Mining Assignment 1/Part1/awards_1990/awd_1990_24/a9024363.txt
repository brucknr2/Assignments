Abstract    :
                   Present theories of magnetic reconnection fail to account                 
              for magnetospheric substorms.  Recent measurements of impulsive,               
              short duration, high velocity flow bursts directed towards the                 
              Earth also do not conform to the standard picture of                           
              magnetospheric convection at quiet times.  This grant is for                   
              support to study observationally and theoretically the small                   
              scale dynamics of the plasma sheet prior to substorm breakup.                  
              The observational part will characterize individual flow bursts                
              using AMPTE satellite measurements so as to deduce information                 
              that might lead to a better understanding of the their dynamics.               
              The theoretical objective will be to develop a one-dimensional                 
              nonlinear travelling wave model of an individual flow burst                    
              incorporating the effects of non-adiabaticity in the ion                       
              dynamics.
