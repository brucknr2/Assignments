Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Wesleyan University                   
              purchase laser equipment.  This equipment will be used in the                  
              following research activities:  High Resolution Laser                          
              Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Molecular Ions and van der Walls                 
              Cluster Ions, Laser Multiphoton Resonant Ionization Detection                  
              of Electron Stimulated Desorption, Neutral  Angular                            
              Distributions, Rotational and Vibrational Relaxation of                        
              Diatomic Molecules in High Temperature Gases, High Resolution                  
              Studies of Line Profiles in Coherent Anti-Strokes Raman                        
              Scattering, and Laser Prepared State Selected Atomic Collisions.               
                                                                                             
              Lasers emit a narrow beam of coherent, powerful and nearly                     
              monochromatic electromagnetic radiation.  This radiation is                    
              used in chemistry to study a broad range of subjects, from the                 
              dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids to photoelectron                        
              transfer processes, and from interfacial chemistry to                          
              picosecond pulse shaping.  Lasers are also useful in optics,                   
              communications, and engineering.
