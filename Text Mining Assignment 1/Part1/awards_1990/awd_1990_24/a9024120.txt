Abstract    :
              This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment                
              for the research vessel LAURENTIAN operated by the University of               
              Michigan, Center for Great Lakes & Aquatic Sciences, and                       
              dedicated to use in support of ocean science research.                         
                                                                                             
              The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds              
              for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                     
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support               
              for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the               
              deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational               
              equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                       
              receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                         
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and                       
              satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                           
              communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                 
              for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                  
                                                                                             
              The Project Director, Dr. Linda Goad is fully qualified to direct              
              this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the              
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.                           
                                                                                             
              This project will allow the institution to replace an undersize                
              meter wheel, a winch readout power supply, and an old worn out                 
              radar.
