Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Drs. Patrick Thaddeus and Carl Gottlieb will continue a program of             
              laboratory astrophysical research on reactive molecules that are               
              constituents of interstellar gas and circumstellar shells.  They               
              will carry out spectroscopy of carbenes, carbon-chain and other new            
              radicals, silicon molecules, metal carbides, and of the                        
              vibrationally excited states and isotopically substituted species              
              of known reactive molecules.  The investigation will be made with              
              an improved nonresonant double-pass millimeter-wave spectrometer.              
              The whole subject of reactive molecules of astrophysical interest              
              is in a period of explosive growth.  Building on recent detections             
              of SiC, SiCC, highly vibrationally excited SiO, and the cumulene               
              carbenes H2CCC and H2CCCC, the investigation will emphasize surveys            
              of discharges about 50 GHz wide in frequency.  From initial surveys            
              made in this laboratory, many new reactive species are expected.               
              There are also plans to extend the range of the spectrometer                   
              farther into the far infrared and to construct a nonresonant                   
              multipass spectrometer which may result in a significant increase              
              in sensitivity.
