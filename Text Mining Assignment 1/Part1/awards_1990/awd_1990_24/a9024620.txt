Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This grants will help the Los Angeles Council of Black                         
              Professional Engineers provide tutoring and mentoring                          
              activities for minority students from disadvantaged and                        
              other backgrounds.  The activities will focus heavily on                       
              science, mathematics, and computer science.  The unique                        
              part of this proposed project is the comprehensive                             
              approach of attracting and nurturing students from                             
              kindergarten through high school.  Faculty involved in the                     
              project are minority engineers or other scientific-                            
              oriented personnel.                                                            
                                                                                             
              One exciting aspect of this proposed program is that it is                     
              community-based and will employ all available resources in                     
              the area to encourage a large number of minority students                      
              to utilize the academic enrichment services of the                             
              project.  Tracking and evaluation plans will be used to                        
              monitor student progress through this comprehensive                            
              program.  Many of the approaches are novel and will help                       
              increase the participation of minorities in science and                        
              engineering.
