Abstract    :
                   This project continues the studies of turbulence undertaken               
              previously, combining mathematical analysis, numerical                         
              simulations, and methods from dynamical systems.  The turbulent                
              flows arise as solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.  The                  
              permanent regime for a turbulent flow is related to an attractor               
              in the phase space of the flow.  The attractor in turn is                      
              approximable by an approximate inertial manifold.  Hence                       
              development of numerical algorithms that correspond to                         
              approximate inertial manifolds is a central theme of the work.                 
                   Turbulence is a fundamental phenomenon in fluid flows.  Such              
              flows arise in describing the behavior of planes, boats, pumps,                
              and engines.  A better understanding of turbulence will help to                
              improve the design of these machines.
