Abstract    :
              This award supports cooperative research in surface                            
              engineering and tribology between Dr. Leon M. Keer of                          
              Northwestern University and Drs. K.L. Johnson and J.E.                         
              Field of the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.                          
              The objectives are to develop a methodology for measuring                      
              adhesion of hard coatings on substrates for optimum                            
              resistance against wear and delamination, and to develop                       
              a theoretical model for predicting failure of soft thin                        
              films, such as aluminum on silica.                                             
                                                                                             
              Dr. Keer's recent research on hard coatings suggests                           
              quantitative methods for measuring their bond strength on                      
              substrates.  He proposes to conduct further experimental                       
              measurements to determine their mechanical properties                          
              and further his theoretical analysis in partnership with                       
              Dr. Field's group at Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory.                         
              This group's research on stress distribution, residual                         
              stresses and mechanical properties of hard coatings fits                       
              in well with Keer's research.  In collaboration with Dr.                       
              Johnson, Keer proposes to develop a failure model for                          
              soft thin film and fracture mechanics using elastic-                           
              plastic analysis.  He is a leading exponent of the                             
              elastic approach while Johnson has dealt with the plastic                      
              deformation of materials.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project effectively combines the complementary                            
              expertise and different scientific approaches of leading                       
              researchers in the U.S. and United Kingdom.  The results                       
              of their joint efforts will have substantial impact on                         
              microelectronic stress analysis and design and will                            
              advance understanding of surface engineering.
