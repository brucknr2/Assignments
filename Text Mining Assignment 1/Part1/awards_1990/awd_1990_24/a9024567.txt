Abstract    :
                   The Treatise of Invertebrate Paleontology comprises 35                    
              volumes published over a 40 year interval.  These volumes are                  
              compendia of the genera of fossil invertebrates, and they have                 
              had an immeasurable impact on research and graduate training in                
              paleontology.  In addition to catalyzing further systematic,                   
              paleoecological, and evolutionary research, the Treatise has made              
              summary data available for statistical analysis, thereby creating              
              an entirely new approach to paleobiology.  Dr. Roger Kaesler,                  
              Editor in Chief of the Treatise, proposes two years of planning                
              activities that will lead to implementation of a computer                      
              database to accompany future printed Treatise volumes.                         
                   The proposed initiation of computerization for the Treatise               
              will have an enormous impact on research in paleontology.  The                 
              proposed database will establish the means to connect Treatise                 
              data directly to other taxonomic databases, to computerized                    
              catalogs of museum specimens, to literature databases, and to                  
              Geographic Information Systems.  The proposed planning activities              
              are forward-looking and will establish long-range directions that              
              will benefit large segments of the biological and geological                   
              research communities.
