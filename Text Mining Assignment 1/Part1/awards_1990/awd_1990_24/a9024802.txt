Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Support is being provided to purchase a new Charge Coupled Device              
              detector system for Ritter Observatory with a large format (770 x              
              1152 pixels) chip and enhanced blue sensitivity.  This detector                
              will be used with an existing echelle spectrograph to provide four             
              times the wavelength coverage (with equal integration time)                    
              possible with the present CCD, and would permit observations at                
              shorter wavelengths than is presently possible.  Presently 3-4                 
              faculty members, 4-6 M.S. and Ph.D. level graduate students, and               
              6-8 undergraduate Physics majors are involved with observing                   
              projects with the Ritter telescope.  A large-format CCD will                   
              enhance research opportunities in the areas such as early-type                 
              stellar atmospheres, interstellar material, and stellar                        
              chromospheres.  Due to prior purchased of similar CCD system, many             
              components (computer, software, image display) need not be                     
              duplicated.  This award is being matched by the University of                  
              Toledo.
