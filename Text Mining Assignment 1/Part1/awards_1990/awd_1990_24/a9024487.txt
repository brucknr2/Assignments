Abstract    :
              Examination of the recordings of strong-ground                                 
              motions induced by the October 17, 1989                                        
              Loma Prieta earthquake suggests that non-                                      
              linear amplification effects occurred at                                       
              sediment sites above the acceleration level of                                 
              0.3G - a phenomenon with very important                                        
              implications in earthquake engineering.                                        
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research program is to                                   
              examine the possibility that non-linear site                                   
              effects occurred, and the associated mechanism                                 
              underlying the phenomenon.
