Abstract    :
                   Professor Shields and others have recently found many new                 
              interpretations of entropy in such diverse areas as string                     
              matching in DNA analysis, prefix generation and Hausdorf                       
              dimension, recurrence and waiting time problems in probability                 
              theory, Markov order estimation, statistical problems associated               
              with recognizing a process from its sample paths, and hypothesis               
              testing.  In his project, Professor Shields will extend and                    
              sharpen these recent results and will further develop the                      
              theoretical properties of processes which have connections with                
              entropy.                                                                       
                   Professor Shields' work is on the interface between abstract              
              and applied information theory.  The concept of entropy,                       
              originally developed in physics, and of crucial importance for                 
              the second law of thermodynamics, is the mathematical realization              
              of the vague idea of disorder or lack of information.  This                    
              concept continues to bear fruit in many fields including those                 
              mentioned above.
