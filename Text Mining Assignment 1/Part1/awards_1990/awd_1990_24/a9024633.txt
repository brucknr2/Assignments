Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the formation of a study committee                    
              by the Computer Science and Technology Board (CSTB) of the                     
              National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council to                      
              investigate the academic environment for experimental                          
              computer scientists.  Specifically CSTB hopes to "determine                    
              the scope and scale of the difficulties of the country's                       
              doctorate granting computer science departments in evaluating                  
              the work of faculty whose work is predominately focussed on                    
              building functional systems for external users."  The                          
              committee will assess the problem, identify successful models                  
              and develop recommendations, and finally prepare a report on                   
              its findings.
