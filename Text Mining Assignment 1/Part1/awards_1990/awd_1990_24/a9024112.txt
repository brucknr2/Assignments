Abstract    :
              This proposal is to investigate the narrow bandgap                             
              semiconducting silicide CrSi2.  The goals of the                               
              work are to characterize electrically metal/CrSi2                              
              contacts and CrSi2/Si heterojunctions, to                                      
              demonstrate and measure the infrared                                           
              photoconductive response of CrSi2 thin films, and to                           
              determine the potential of CrSi2 films on Si as an                             
              infrared detector technology.                                                  
              The proposed research is an experimentally-based                               
              investigation of CrSi2 grown as epitaxial thin films                           
              on silicon wafer substrates.  Growths will be                                  
              performed with a versatile "Silicon MBE"-type                                  
              growth system.  Device structures will be fabricated                           
              for characterization of the infrared photoresponse.                            
              These measurements will include the spectral                                   
              dependence of photoconductivity of the films, and                              
              the photoresponse of a Schottky barrier infrared                               
              detector made within the CrSi2 film. Strong                                    
              emphasis will be placed on controlling the films                               
              microstructure, and understanding its influence on                             
              the observed photoelectronic properties.                                       
              We intend to demonstrate the growth and                                        
              properties of an epitaxial semiconducting silicide on                          
              a single-crystal substrate.  We will characterize two                          
              new intrinsic semiconducting infrared detectors                                
              which may be monolithically integrated on a silicon                            
              microelectronic chip.
