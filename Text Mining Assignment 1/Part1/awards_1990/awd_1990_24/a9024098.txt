Abstract    :
              This award supports a study to develop the numerical                           
              modeling techniques necessary to infer past surface                            
              temperatures from temperature profiles measured in ice core                    
              boreholes.  Control theory, a branch of applied mathematics                    
              will be used to recover this information.  Once the                            
              techniques are developed and adequately tested on data from                    
              the Dye 3 borehole, these methods will be applied to the                       
              temperature data to be obtained from the GISP2 borehole at                     
              Summit, Greenland.  This work will help to provide an                          
              independent check on interpretations of isotopic signals                       
              measured in ice cores.
