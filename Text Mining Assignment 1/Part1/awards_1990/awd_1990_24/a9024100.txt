Abstract    :
              This award supports marine geologic research to document                       
              sediment flux and accumulation on the proximal (fjord/shelf)                   
              environments off Kangerdlugssuaq Fjord, East Greenland, and                    
              to compare these with similar shelf/fjord environments along                   
              the Eastern Canadian Arctic margin and with margins of the                     
              Nordic Seas (as part of the international PONAM Project).                      
              This research will emphasize the study of present-day                          
              sediment processes and fluxes within this fjord and will                       
              develop a model of variations in sediment fluxes and                           
              physical and biological composition since the late glacial.                    
              This work will also emphasize the paleoceanographic and                        
              paleoclimatic variations with time.  The research will                         
              target opal and diatom flux as well as benthic foraminifera                    
              as indicators of change in surface water productivity and                      
              bottom water conditions.                                                       
                                                                                             
              A reconnaissance cruise to the fjord and inner shelf in the                    
              autumn 1991, on an Icelandic research vessel, will provide                     
              preliminary data regarding the sea floor morphology, shallow                   
              seismic structure, surface sediment characteristics, bio-                      
              and lithostratigraphy, sedimentology, stratigraphy,                            
              hydrology and suspended matter.  A second cruise, on the                       
              Canadian research vessel Hudson, in 1992 will obtain side-                     
              scan sonar data,  additional high-resolution Huntec DTS                        
              stratigraphy of the fjord basin, and long cores that will                      
              allow further delineation of the relationships between the                     
              seismic and core stratigraphy.
