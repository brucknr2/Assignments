Abstract    :
                   The PI's research has focused on climate variability in                   
              Africa, especially drought in the Sahel.  She plans  to enhance                
              her background by gaining a further understanding of ecology and               
              of biophysical and hydrological processes, to incorporate these                
              new skills in the general circulation model experiments to                     
              include explicit treatment of land surface processes, to explore               
              the feedback that may involve dust generation during drought                   
              episodes and its impact on the atmosphere and to develop a model               
              of atmospheric heating that explicitly considers dust   layers,                
              and to link these concepts to the specific systems that generate               
              rainfall over West Africa, the easterly waves.  The latter will                
              require a study of how the surface energy and water balance                    
              affect the mid-level African easterly jet.  The P.I. proposes                  
              this research with the goal of proving or disproving the theory                
              of land surface feedback in the Sahel droughts.
