Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support cooperative research in chemical                       
              engineering between Dr. Liang-Shih Fan, Ohio State University,                 
              and Dr. J.F. Davidson, University of Cambridge, England.  The                  
              objective of the project is to define the transport behavior                   
              of three-phase fluidization involving low density particles.                   
                                                                                             
              The research will focus on non-rigid bioparticles immobilized                  
              with living microorganisms.  Dr. Fan's current research                        
              program at Ohio State University is concerned primarily with                   
              the hydrodynamics and axial liquid mixing in three-phase                       
              fluidization, involving rigid particles of low densities such                  
              as polystyrene, acetate, acrylic and nylon particles. The                      
              proposed work will complement the active ongoing research                      
              program at the University of Cambridge, which emphasizes                       
              three-phase biofluidization.  During his visit to Cambridge,                   
              Dr. Fan will investigate the hydrodynamics and axial liquid                    
              mixing involving bioparticles such as calcium alginate                         
              particles with and without entrapment of cells and activated                   
              carbon particles immobilized with cells. Effects of particle                   
              properties on three-phase fluidization will be generalized                     
              based on the results of the experiments. This research will                    
              contribute to the understanding of three-phase fluidized bed                   
              applications in biological processing.
