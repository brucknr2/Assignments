Abstract    :
              This renewal proposal focuses on a study of the optical and                    
              electronic properties of alkalides, electrides and mixed systems to            
              determine the nature of electron-electron interactions in                      
              crystalline solids with weakly trapped electrons, factors which                
              lead to electron spin pairing, and the nature of metal-non metal               
              transitions.  Thin films, microcrystalline films, and single                   
              crystals of these materials will be prepared, and their emission-,             
              reflectance-, transmission-, and fluorescence-spectra studied.  The            
              electrical conductivity and impedance spectroscopy of powders and              
              single crystals will be determined, and their photoelectron and                
              thermionic electron emission investigated.
