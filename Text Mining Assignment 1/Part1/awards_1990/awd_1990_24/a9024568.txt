Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award for a long term visit to the United Kingdom will                    
              support collaborative research in geometric analysis and                       
              differential geometry between Steven Rosenberg of Boston                       
              University, K.D. Elworthy of the University of Warwick, and                    
              T. Lyons of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.                             
                                                                                             
              The investigators propose to apply probabilistic and classical                 
              geometric methods to problems in differential geometry.  They                  
              will study Riemannian manifolds and their applications to                      
              topology and geometry of manifolds.  Three problems will be                    
              investigated: (1)  The Hopf conjecture for the Euler                           
              characteristic of negatively curved manifolds; (2) a method for                
              extending Bochner's and Myers' theorems for positively                         
              curved manifolds; and (3) a method for yeilding soft                           
              eigenvalue estimates for the Laplacian using a modification of                 
              the Fukaya method.  The later problem will be developed with                   
              Dr. T. Lyons of the University of Edinburgh.  Manifolds are                    
              a fundamental concept in many areas of mathematics and                         
              physics.  This collaboration offers an innovative approach to                  
              studying these problems by combining the complementary                         
              expertise of the U.S. and British investigators in classical                   
              differential geometry and in probability respectively.
