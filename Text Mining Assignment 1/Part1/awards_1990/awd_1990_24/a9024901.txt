Abstract    :
                   The two investigators on this project will work on various                
              problems in approximation theory and in the theory of orthogonal               
              polynomials.  Professor Nevai will concentrate on ordinary and                 
              generalized polynomial inequalities, difference and differential               
              equations, spectral theory of tradiagonal and banded matrices,                 
              Toeplitz and Hankel forms, Hilbert space operators and Jacobi                  
              matrices.  In addition to this analytical work Professor Nevai                 
              will continue to develop software for orthogonal polynomials.                  
              Professor Erdelyi will work on extremal properties of                          
              ordinary and generalized polynomials and on various types of                   
              polynomial inequalities that figure prominently in approximation               
              theory.  The investigators will work independently of each other               
              on some problems and collaboratively on others, their talents                  
              complementing each other.
