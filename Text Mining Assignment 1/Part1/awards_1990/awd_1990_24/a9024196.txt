Abstract    :
              This project entails nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)                          
              investigations of incommensurate systems, i.e. solids which have               
              perfect long range order but no lattice periodicity and are thus               
              intermediate between crystal lattices and disordered systems like              
              glasses and biological systems.  Incommensurate solids are                     
              characterized by at least two sublattices the periodicities of                 
              which can not be described as the ratio of two integers.  These                
              systems exhibit a number of new phenomena not found in perfect                 
              crystals or disordered systems: an sliding mass density wave                   
              distinct from lattice vibrations in normal crystal lattices.                   
              Excitations of the modulation waves are known as phasons and can be            
              studied in a unique fashion by NMR techniques.  In addition, these             
              modulation waves can become pinned in a manner similar to vortex               
              pinning in superconductors.  The current resaerch will study                   
              pinning and depinning processes in a range of insulators, including            
              examples on incommensurate lattices in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions.  The             
              results of the investigations described in this proposal should be             
              of basic importance for the whole field of solid-state                         
              "superfluidity" in crystals, since the modulation wave in an                   
              incommensurate solid may be thought of a solid-state superfluid                
              which may be either charged  or uncharged.
