Abstract    :
              This project is an interdisciplinary effort on the study                       
              of diarthrodial joint biomechanics utilizing automated                         
              and adaptive nonlinear three-dimensional finite                                
              element analysis (FEA) to describe the actual anatomic                         
              geometries and biphasic properties of articular cartilage                      
              on the joint surface.  Significant recent advances have                        
              been made in the development of: 1) mixture                                    
              constitutive equations to describe the behaviors of                            
              hydrated soft tissues; 2) finite element formulations for                      
              these mixture equations; 3) the boundary conditions                            
              between the synovial fluid and the articular surface;                          
              and 4) the determination of three-dimensional                                  
              anatomic geometry of joints.  What is now required is a                        
              comprehensive undertaking for the development of                               
              computational mechanics methods leading to an                                  
              automated and adaptive finite element numerical                                
              model for the deformational response of diarthrodial                           
              joints.  Thus the fundamental studies will focus on the                        
              development of the 1) FEA of three-dimensional                                 
              problems utilizing the nonlinear finite deformation                            
              biphasic laws for articular cartilage; 2) automated and                        
              adaptive methods for the generation of                                         
              two-dimensional and three-dimensional meshes                                   
              required for the FEA to account for known singular                             
              boundary layer effects; and 3) interface for the ditigal                       
              stereophotogrammetric (SPG) anatomic data with the                             
              automatic mesh generation in our 3-D FEA meshes.                               
              These studies will provide significant advances toward a                       
              precise 3-D simulation of biomechanical problems                               
              related to diarthrodial joints, with realistic loading                         
              conditions, joint geometries, loads, and constituent                           
              material properties.  Ultimately, these fundamental                            
              studies can provide an understanding of the complex                            
              biomechanical behaviors of normal and pathological                             
              human joints, as well as the possibility of the                                
              development of new interactive computer programs for                           
              imaging and diagnostic techniques to develop new                               
              clinical treatment modalities.
