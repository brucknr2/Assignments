Abstract    :
              This project will attempt to quantify the effects of variations                
              in the major ice-atmosphere energy budget terms on the arctic sea              
              ice concentration and distribution.  Observational studies have                
              shown the existence of a variety of interrelationships between                 
              the atmosphere and the sea ice, but modeling studies are required              
              to identify and quantify forcing mechanisms, directions of                     
              operation, and the sensitivity of the interactions to changes in               
              the state of the ocean and the atmosphere.  Specifically, this                 
              project will make use of a ten-year data set to construct forcing              
              functions for a coupled sea ice-radiative transfer model.                      
              Sensitivity studies will be conducted to identify specific                     
              climatically interesting regions, to determine if intense short-               
              term events affect the long-term sea ice state, and to define the              
              overall limits of the arctic climate system.
