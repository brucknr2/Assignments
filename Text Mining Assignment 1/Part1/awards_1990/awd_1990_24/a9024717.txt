Abstract    :
                   This proposal is concerned with questions which arise from the            
              desire to compute canonical bases for associative algebras.  The               
              principal investigator will develop a theory of Groebner bases                 
              founded on a vector space approach.  He will study language-                   
              theoretic properties of a straightened basis and will use word                 
              combinatorics to simplify and bound algorithms.  Finally, he will              
              connect these new techniques to an older theory of p-filtrations as            
              well as push an earlier, successful search for crystal invariants              
              further.                                                                       
                   Given a finite dimensional algebra, every element of the                  
              algebra can be written as a combination of a finite set of elements            
              which is called the basis.  This basis is not unique.  This project            
              is concerned with finding a basis such that there is an effective              
              method of determining what elements can be written as a combination            
              of this basis.  This work is an important step towards the use of              
              computers in this field.
