Abstract    :
              Oxidation free-radical cyclization, in which the initial                       
              radical is generated oxidatively and/or the cyclic radical is                  
              oxidized to terminate the reaction, has considerable synthetic                 
              potential since more highly functionalized products can be                     
              prepared from simpler precursors than with the standard tin                    
              hydride reductive radical cyclizations.  This research consists                
              of several interrelated studies developing new synthetic                       
              methods based on, and examining the mechanism of, oxidative                    
              free-radical cyclization using Mn(III), Cu(II) or Ce(IV) as the                
              oxidant, and several natural product syntheses designed to                     
              exploit and develop oxidative free-radical cyclization.  In the                
              area of methods development it is planned to examine: (1)                      
              addition to alkynes, solvent effects, (2) use of haloalkenes to                
              control the regiochemistry of the cyclization, (3) new                         
              substitution patterns, (4) trapping by addition to nitriles,                   
              (5) trapping by addition to aldehydes, (6) oxidation,                          
              cyclization, oxidation, cyclization, (7) oxidative cyclization                 
              followed by intermolecular trapping, (8) oxidation,                            
              cyclization, allylation, oxidation and cyclization, (9) use of                 
              conjugated beta-keto esters, (10) use of sulfoxides for                        
              asymmetric free-radical cyclization, (11) probes for the                       
              reversibility of radical cyclization, (12) oxidative                           
              cyclization of unsaturated silyl enol ethers, (13) oxidative                   
              cyclization of unsaturated silyloxycyclopropanes, and (14)                     
              conversion of other radicals to alkenes with copper                            
              carboxylates.  In the area of total synthesis, syntheses are                   
              planned of: (1) velloziolone, (2) a key tricyclic intermediate                 
              for gibberellic acid synthesis, (3) steviol, (4) iresin, (5)                   
              avenaciolide, and (6) models for aklavinone synthesis.                         
                                                                                             
              The Organic Synthesis Program is continuing the support of Dr                  
              Snider's studies of Mn(III)-based oxidative free-radical                       
              cyclizations.  This work has the potential to develop                          
              simplified new routes to complex polycyclic systems.  These                    
              should help provide efficient paths to molecules needed by                     
              modern biology and agriculture.
