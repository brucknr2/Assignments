Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant supports a symposium is on the kinetics of diffusional              
              phase transformations.  The emphasis of the program is to focus                
              on essentials of theory of homogeneous nucleation and how it                   
              compares to experimental results.  The symposium considers all                 
              three common states of matter, as follows:  seven papers on                    
              homogeneous nucleation theory; six papers where homogeneous                    
              nucleation theory is compared to experiments in which the                      
              reactions, solid -> solid, metallic glass -> crystalline solid,                
              liquid -> solid, and vapor -> solid nucleation, take place; eight              
              papers in which nucleation and/or growth theory are applied to                 
              fundamental and practical problems.  The symposium honors the                  
              late G. Marshall Pound, a distinguished scientist who worked                   
              effectively in this field of research.
