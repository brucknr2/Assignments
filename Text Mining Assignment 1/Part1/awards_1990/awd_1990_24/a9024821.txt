Abstract    :
                   Recent developments in pulsed power technologies for                      
              generating kilojoule energy levels economically, have made                     
              electrocrushing and electrohydraulic fragmentation of rocks and ore            
              comminution more practical.  The Phase I results have demonstrated             
              the effectiveness of liberating copper from copper porphyry ores               
              using electrocrushing and electrohydraulic fracturing techniques,              
              as a function of energy deposited in the ore samples, the electric             
              field strength, pulse width and electrode configuration.  The                  
              successful proof-of-concept demonstration of ore liberation of                 
              Phase I using electrocrushing, therefore leads to a more exhaustive            
              research development program for Phase II.  There are two key                  
              objectives for Phase II research program:  (1) to extend the Phase             
              I results to include two (or three) additional ore types for which             
              the market price is stable and sufficiently high, and to conduct               
              more exhaustive electrocrushing experiments with a larger number               
              of samples and (2) to address specific energy consumption and                  
              mineral recovery issues by comparing the electrocrushing and                   
              electrohydraulic fragmentation techniques to the traditional method            
              of compressive mechanical disintegration.  The experiments will be             
              conducted in pulsed power facilities using the optimum electrode               
              configurations and discharge energy levels arrived at in Phase I.              
              The first series of tests will be conducted in the batch mode using            
              both short and long pulse width discharges, followed by slug flows             
              stimulating laboratory scale continuous ore processing.
