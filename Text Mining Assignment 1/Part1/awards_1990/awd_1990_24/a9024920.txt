Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical astronomy and physics will focus                  
              on the nature of the dark (i.e., non-luminous) matter in the                   
              universe, and on the large-scale structure of the universe.                    
              The dark matter is known to exist, and its nature is an                        
              important puzzle.  The large-scale structure is known to be                    
              lumpy, and the question of how this lumpy structure grew out                   
              of the very homogeneous early universe is another important                    
              puzzle.
