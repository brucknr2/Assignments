Abstract    :
              There are two thrusts to this research.  First, fundamental studies            
              to characterize the intrinsic kinetics and adsorption parameters               
              of two key pharmaceutical, insulin and urokinase, in ion exchange,             
              hydrophobic interaction, and affinity chromatography systems will              
              be made.  Measurements of the equilibrium isotherms and kinetic                
              constants of the pure compounds will be made and the effects of pH             
              and salt level on the affinities and kinetic constants will be                 
              investigated.  An existing dynamic column simulation model will be             
              extended to accommodate gradient systems.  The model will be                   
              validated with pure component experimental data and then will be               
              used to study how impurities and products compete for sorbent                  
              sites.  As a second and supporting thrust the complex interplay                
              between biomolecules and sorbent functional groups resulting from              
              steric effects, hydration, as well as hydrophobic and electrostatic            
              interactions will be studied.  This research should provide a                  
              complete description of the configurations of a complex during                 
              binding, allow quantitative assessment of various intermolecular               
              forces, and predict the reactive affinities for different                      
              molecules.  In this way, the understanding of how molecular                    
              structure affects sorbent selectivity will be advanced.  The                   
              research will also have a significant impact on the synthesis and              
              identification of more selective sorbents for biochemical                      
              separations.
