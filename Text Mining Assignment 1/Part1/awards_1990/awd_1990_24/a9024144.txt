Abstract    :
              The research concerns developing effective analytical performance              
              modelling techniques for parallel systems.  The project concentrates           
              on three directions:                                                           
                                                                                             
                1.  Workload characterization for future parallel systems.                   
                                                                                             
                2.  Analysis of future parallel system design questions.                     
                                                                                             
                3.  Advancing the state-of-the-art in modelling techniques,                  
                    incorporating techniques from disciplines other than queuing             
                    theory into the modelling process.
