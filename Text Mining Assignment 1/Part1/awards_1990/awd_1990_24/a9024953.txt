Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop a general purpose portable              
              system for automated reasoning based on a new inference rule - RUE             
              Resolution - which incorporates the axioms of the equality into the            
              definition of resolution, producing much shorter and more transparent          
              proofs.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Experiments with a prototype RUE theorem prover have produced                  
              excellent comparative results.  A theoretical study of the                     
              implications of RUE resolution as applied to Logic Programming, to the         
              Reduction Method of Knuth and to Paramodulation will be made.
