Abstract    :
              Dynamic image is a series of static images with a                              
              specified order and elapse time interval between                               
              each element of the sequence.  The difference                                  
              analysis of dynamic images and the usual scene                                 
              analysis is that in addition to information being                              
              extracted from each element of the sequence,                                   
              information from the sequence of images must be                                
              time integrated.  Efficient computational algorithms                           
              for treating time-sequence data sets plays a central                           
              role.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              Computational methods for measuring the local                                  
              spatial and temporal properties of digital dynamic                             
              images will be developed.  Spatial similarity for                              
              aligning images in an image sequence (registration                             
              correction), and temporal similarity techniques for                            
              measuring local temporal changes and correction                                
              between them will be used.  Algorithms will be                                 
              developed for the calculation of spatial (two-                                 
              dimensional) and temporal similarity measures                                  
              which can be utilized for the processing of gigabyte                           
              data arrays, e.g. satellite and medical imagery.  The                          
              emphasis will be on trade-offs between                                         
              computational efficiency and accuracy.
