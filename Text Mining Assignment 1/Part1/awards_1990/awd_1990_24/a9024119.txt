Abstract    :
              A prototype domain-specific software                                           
              environment will be developed will                                             
              be developed using structural                                                  
              engineering domain as a test case.                                             
              This environment will be centered                                              
              around the concept of software reuse                                           
              and will be composed of Computer                                               
              Aided Software Engineering (CASE)                                              
              tools for managing and integrating                                             
              reusable software components into                                              
              applications.  The goal is to create                                           
              an environment by enhancing and                                                
              tailoring general-purpose software                                             
              development to a specific class of                                             
              applications, and to demonstrate its                                           
              potential for improvement of quality                                           
              and productivity in research and                                               
              instructional software.
