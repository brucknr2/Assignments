Abstract    :
                   This project involves production of a book summarizing                    
              information on the biology of the 178 species of amphibians and                
              reptiles occurring in the Yucatan Peninsula (defined to include                
              all of the Mexican states of Campeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo,              
              together with northern Chiapas, eastern Tabasco, the Guatemalan                
              Department of El Peten, and the Republic of Belize).  The book will            
              permit biologists and educated lay persons (including those species            
              of amphibian or reptile in the Peninsula, to know its geographical             
              distribution at a glance, and to understand its ecology, behavior,             
              food habits, and reproductive biology.                                         
                   Because the Yucatan Peninsula is experiencing rapid                       
              deforestation due to lumbering activities, and to the explosive                
              buildup of tourist facilities along the east coast, remaining                  
              wilderness areas are under ever-increasing pressure, and important             
              decisions concerning the preservation of natural areas must be, and            
              are being, made.  The book will provide, for an important element              
              of the vertebrate fauna, the critical information necessary to make            
              informed decisions concerning land management, and conservation                
              policy in this large (240,000 sq. km.) portion of the New World                
              lowland tropics.
