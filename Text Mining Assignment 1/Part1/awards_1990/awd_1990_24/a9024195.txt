Abstract    :
              The College of Oceanography at Oregon State University                         
              will acquire several items of oceanographic instrument-                        
              ation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.                          
              This equipment is maintained for use on or in association                      
              with the R/V WECOMA, a research vessel owned by the NSF                        
              and operated by the University.  A substantial part of the                     
              ship's operating schedule during 1991 is in support of                         
              NSF-sponsored research projects.  The instrumentation will                     
              also increase the capabilities of the ship and of the                          
              University to support research and engineering activities.                     
              The instrumentation includes:                                                  
                                                                                             
              -CTD sensors, pressure gauges, and other enhancements for                      
               obtaining detailed profiles of seawater conductivity and                      
               temperature as a function of depth,                                           
              -an upgrade for an autoanalyzer that measures a variety of                     
                chemical constituents in seawater, and                                       
              -a large volume pump and filtration system for making a                        
               variety of biological and chemical measurements at sea.                       
                                                                                             
              The instrumentation described above will increase the                          
              capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored                          
              research and engineering projects.
