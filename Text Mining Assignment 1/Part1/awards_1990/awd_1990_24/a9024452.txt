Abstract    :
              This project is part of a collaborative effort to obtain long-                 
              term (2 years) observations of ocean circulation and atmospheric               
              forcing, in anticipation of an intensive experiment planned for                
              the Western Pacific Warm Pool in late 1992/early 1993, called                  
              TOGA-COARE (Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment).  Long-              
              term measurements will begin in late 1991, and continue until well             
              after the intensive experiment is completed, providing the overall             
              environmental context for the intensive experiment.  In this                   
              component, together with colleagues at NOAA's Pacific Marine                   
              Environmental Laboratory, the P.I.'s will deploy and maintain an               
              array of thermistor chain and conductivity moorings having surface             
              meteorological packages.  This array will provide data on ocean                
              structure and atmospheric forcing, while separate current meter                
              arrays, deployed by other collaborators, will yield data on ocean              
              circulation.
