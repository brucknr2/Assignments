Abstract    :
                   The Entomology Collection of the California Academy of                    
              Sciences contains approximately 12.4 million specimens                         
              representing 300,000 species, and it ranks among the largest and               
              most actively used insect collections in the world.  It is the                 
              principal collection of its type in the western U.S.  Dr. David                
              Kavanaugh, Curator in charge of the collection, has devised an                 
              ambitious plan to improve the curation and availability of the                 
              collection.  New storage trays and identification labels will                  
              enhance the utility of the collection to visiting researchers and              
              to the collection management staff.  Many important collections                
              that are currently inaccessible will be processed and made                     
              readily available to visiting investigators and through the                    
              Academy's specimen loan program.                                               
                   The proposed collection improvement project will increase                 
              the collection's research impact significantly, and will help to               
              assure the long-term safety of irreplaceable research specimens.               
              Collections of natural history specimens such as this one are                  
              unique resources for the study of biological diversity.  Future                
              generations of research will rely on the continued growth and                  
              improvement of museum collections.
