Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Advances in the fabrication of alloys have led to an increased                 
              emphasis on accurate structural characterization.  The research                
              conducted here involves a study of the internal strains in random              
              solid solutions caused by the size effect of the different atoms.              
              Recent work has shown that analytic solutions are possible in terms            
              of simple lattice integrals which characterize the topological                 
              rigidity of the lattice.  The many body aspects of dense random                
              arrays of overlapping strain fields are emphasized.  The aim of the            
              research is to produce analytical results for physical quantities              
              that can be experimentally measured.  These include the Bragg and              
              Huang components of x-ray and neutron diffraction, and the mean and            
              variance of the near neighbor distances obtained from EXAFS                    
              experiments.  The analytic work will be verified by computer                   
              simulations using realistic potentials to generate relaxed samples             
              from which quantities of experimental interest can be extracted.               
              This unified approach will be applied to semiconductors, FCC metals            
              and rare gas solids.
