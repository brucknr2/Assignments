Abstract    :
              This award supports a two year project to initiate                             
              cooperative studies between the University of Alaska and the                   
              Institute of Geology of the Yakut Science Center, Yakutsk,                     
              USSR, on the tectonics of the northeastern USSR.  This                         
              project will study the Mesozoic to present-day tectonics of                    
              eastern Yakutia and its implications for the evolution of                      
              the Arctic Ocean and lithospheric processes.  This will be                     
              done by examining the development of the Kolymian structural                   
              loop and its effects on the present-day North America-                         
              Eurasia plate boundary.  This project will initially consist                   
              of studies of the paleomagnetism of Mesozoic rocks from the                    
              Cherskii Range (central Kolymian loop) and the                                 
              seismotectonics of the northern Cherskii Range and adjacent                    
              areas.  This award supports paleomagnetic sample collection                    
              and analysis, for the initiation of a seismic data exchange                    
              between the Yakut Science Center and the University of                         
              Alaska, and for cooperative analysis of seismic data.
