Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will investigate                  
              ways to determine the sequence of fundamental building blocks                  
              of small proteins using a variant of mass spectrometry.                        
              Potential applications include diagnosis of some genetic                       
              diseases, and monitoring of metabolic irregularities.

              Research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                    
              Program in the Chemistry Division, will use laser desorption                   
              mass spectrometry and collision-induced dissociation to study                  
              the fragmentation of vaporized peptides.  Fourier Transform                    
              mass spectrometry will allow many sequential                                   
              collision/measurement cycles, so that one may step-wise                        
              decompose the peptides.  Both atomic and molecular collision                   
              species will be tested.
