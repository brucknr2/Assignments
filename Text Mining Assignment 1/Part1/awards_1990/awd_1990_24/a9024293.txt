Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The proposed research will lead to new information regarding the               
              molecular processes by which animals respond to environmental                  
              change.  The model system employed is the euryhaline crab, an                  
              animal capable of adjusting to broad changes of salinity, at the               
              same time maintaining a relatively constant salt level in the                  
              blood.  The process by which the crab regulates its blood salt                 
              includes two transport systems at opposite ends of the cells making            
              up the gill lining.  One system brings sodium ions into the cell               
              from the ambient water, in exchange for hydrogen ions, thus helping            
              to regulate the acid-base status as well as the ionic level of the             
              animal.  The other system pumps sodium ions from the cell into the             
              blood, this time in exchange for potassium or ammonium ion.  A                 
              similar mechanism operates in the mammalian kidney, retaining                  
              sodium ions while hydrogen ions and ammonium ions are excreted.                
              The advantage of studying the crab is that the animal naturally                
              experience wide fluctuations in demand on the sodium transport                 
              systems.  The approach will be to examine the molecular responses              
              of the crab to salinity change, including changes in the synthesis             
              or degradation of specific RNA and protein molecules.  Both the                
              sodium/hydrogen ion exchanger and the sodium/potassium pump will               
              receive detailed attention in the research program.//
