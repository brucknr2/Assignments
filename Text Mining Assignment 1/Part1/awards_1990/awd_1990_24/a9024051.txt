Abstract    :
                 Dr. Henderson is a pioneering investigator in the area of                   
              developmental cell cohesion in Dictyostelium.  The problem being               
              addressed is that of the function and chemical structure of                    
              asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins which she has              
              shown to be involved in cohesion.                                              
                                                                                             
              This award is a National Science Foundation Faculty Award for Women            
              Scientists and Engineers.  The proposal fulfills the FAW                       
              objectives, which are: 1, to recognize outstanding and promising               
              women scientists and engineers in academic careers of research and             
              teaching and 2, to facilitate the further development of their                 
              careers.
