Abstract    :
              This is a 3-year major portion of the inventory of all                         
              caterpillars, their host plant relationships, and their parasitoids            
              in the tropical dry forest of the Guanacaste Conservation Area in              
              northwestern Costa Rica.  The inventory results are designed to                
              make caterpillars and their trophic relationships with food plants             
              and parasitoids available to basic studies in ecology, systematics,            
              behavior, physiology and evolution, and to applied users in natural            
              products chemistry, education, and pest management.  The overall               
              goal is to establish this biological system as an integral part of             
              the non-destructive sustainable use of a complex tropical wildland             
              by science and by Costa Rican society.  Specifically, this project             
              will accomplish the following.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Locate, rear and characterize the caterpillars of a minimum of                 
              another 500 species of macromoths (and some butterflies), and a                
              minimum of another 335 species of microlepidoptera, so as to yield             
              a total of approximately 1450 species characterized for this                   
              forest.  This is approximately half of its caterpillar fauna.  All             
              information will be stored in computerized data bases;                         
                                                                                             
              Maintain and enlarge the current collecting of voucher material for            
              all rearings, and increase the number of duplicates so as to be                
              able to easily donate specimens to studies of taxonomy and                     
              morphology of caterpillars and pupae;                                          
                                                                                             
              Publish field guides in Spanish and English to the caterpillars of             
              this forest, family by family, as the rearing for each family is               
              complete or nearly so;                                                         
                                                                                             
              Publish survey papers listing the host plant records for all of                
              the species reared, papers listing the parasitoids reared from the             
              caterpillars collected in the field and papers on caterpillars and             
              parasitoid natural history.
