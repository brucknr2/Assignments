Abstract    :
                   A program of development and refinement of facilities for                 
              neutron interferometry is carried out at the University of                     
              Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) and at the NIST Research                      
              Reactor's Cold Neutron Research Facility, where a new neutron                  
              interferometry station will be built as a collaborative program.               
              These facilities will be applied to the study of various aspects               
              of neutron Schroedinger Wave Optics, including the following:                  
                   1)   Aharonov-Casher topological phase shift;                             
                   2)   Wave-packet reconstruction with a crystal analyzer;                  
                   3)   Scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect;                                         
                   4)   Development of large-scale interferometers;                          
                   5)   Search for quaternions in quantum mechanics;                         
                   6)   Gravitationally-induced quantum interference;                        
                   7)   Michelson-Morley experiment with neutrons;                           
                   8)   Search for phase shift due to the coupling of neutron                
              spin to rotation;                                                              
                   9)   Wheeler delayed-choice experiment; and                               
                   10)  Effect of the moon and sun upon quantum interference.
