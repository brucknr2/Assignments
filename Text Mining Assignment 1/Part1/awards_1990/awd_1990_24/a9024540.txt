Abstract    :
                   The theory of graph labellings and their applications is an               
              important mathematical subject.  It interacts with graph theory,               
              combinatorics, group theory and non-associative algebras.  The                 
              study of graceful directed graphs leads to the construction of a               
              non-associative algebraic structure called a neofield.  Graph                  
              labellings has applications to other branches of mathematics,                  
              computer science, engineering, operations research and social                  
              sciences.                                                                      
                   This grant will partially support a conference on graph                   
              labellings and their applications to be held at Northeastern                   
              University in March 1991. The conference will feature hour talks by            
              three experts in the field and will bring together additional                  
              leading researchers who will present shorter talks.  There will be             
              strong emphasis on applications and possible interactions with                 
              industry.  The informal structure of the conference will provide an            
              excellent opportunity for young researchers and graduate students              
              to become involved in this rapidly growing area.
