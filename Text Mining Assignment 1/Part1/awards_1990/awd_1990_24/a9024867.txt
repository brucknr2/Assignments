Abstract    :
                   Professor Battle will continue his work to construct                      
              nontrivial quantum field theories.  In particular, this project                
              will concentrate on the nonlinear sigma model, a strictly                      
              renormalizable asymptotically free theory.  His technique of                   
              construction will use the relatively new concept of wavelet which              
              he will develop to meet the particular requirements of quantum                 
              field theory.                                                                  
                   Quantum fields are the basic quantities which are thought to              
              be responsible for all the interactions between particles which                
              exist in nature.  It is therefore notable that these objects which             
              are essentially mathematical entities, have not been shown to                  
              exist.  Professor Battle is one of the few mathematical physicists             
              who work in the area of construction of quantum field theories.                
              His project involves the construction of a model theory called the             
              nonlinear sigma model.  A side benefit of Battle's work is his use             
              of wavelets in this construction.  These objects have turned out to            
              be of use in many other areas of pure and applied mathematics, and             
              Battle has and will continue to contribute toward their                        
              development.
