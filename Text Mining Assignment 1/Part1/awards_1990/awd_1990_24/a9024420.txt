Abstract    :
              This award from the Office of Special Projects will enable the                 
              participation of seven distinguished U.S. chemists in the                      
              International Conference on Chemical Science in Development                    
              which will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Institute of                  
              Chemistry, Ceylon and which will be held May 14-18, 1991 in                    
              Colombo, Sri Lanka.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The conference will deal with both academic and applied aspects                
              of inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry.  Chemistry has                  
              an important role to play in underdevloped and developing                      
              countries.  Problems of food, clothing, shelter and health are                 
              frequently at the fore in such countries.  Chemical sciences                   
              and industries play a major role in attacking problems in all                  
              of these areas.  Sri Lanka already has developed a tradition in                
              chemistry. This special symposium will bring together and                      
              foster interactions among scientists from many countries in the                
              region.
