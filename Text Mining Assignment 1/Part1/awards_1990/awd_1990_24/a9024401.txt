Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses fundamental processes and atomic level                  
              details of oxygen induced defects in compound semiconductors such              
              as aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs).  Epitaxial crystal growth by            
              MOCVD with unique introduction and control of oxygen content by                
              aluminum alkoxides, characterization of the epitaxial layers by                
              optical, electrical, and ion channelling chemical reactions, and               
              assessment of the thermal stability of GaAs:AlO epilayers are                  
              included in the research.  The information gained from these                   
              studies is expected to provide new scientific understanding and is             
              relevant to semiconductor materials of significant technological               
              importance; AlGaAs and GaAs epitaxial layers are used in                       
              heterojunction devices such as solid state lasers and transistors.
