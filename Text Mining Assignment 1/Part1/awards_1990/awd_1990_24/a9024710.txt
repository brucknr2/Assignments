Abstract    :
                   The objective of this work is to characterize the dynamic                 
              processes that couple highly excited molecular states with the                 
              dissociation and ionization continua.  A new multiparticle                     
              detector will permit the simultaneous investigation of the energy              
              and angular distributions of several electrons and ionic                       
              fragments produced from a single molecule in strong field                      
              excitation.  Specific objectives include (1) characterization of               
              the competition between dissociation and ionization in                         
              multiphoton excited molecules, (2) determination of the electron               
              energy distribution from electrons arising in multiple                         
              ionization, and (3) determination of the temporal sequence of                  
              photon absorption in Coulomb explosions.
