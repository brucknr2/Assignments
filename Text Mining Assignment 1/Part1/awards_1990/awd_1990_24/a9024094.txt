Abstract    :
              This award will support the research collaboration of                          
              Alwyn Gentry of the Missouri Botanical Garden and                              
              Ricardo Rueda, a Nicaraguan graduate student in                                
              biology at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.  The                         
              project aims to elucidate the taxonomic relationships                          
              within Petrea, an important and poorly understood                              
              neotropical genus of about 30 plant species.                                   
                                                                                             
              The last taxonomic treatment of Petrea was done over                           
              50 years ago.  The limits of the taxa are unclear and                          
              their interrelationships need reevaluation.  Very                              
              little is known about Petrea's ecology, cytology,                              
              anatomy, phylogeny, and pollination biology.  Because                          
              its species can be propagated by seed, seeds will be                           
              collected and germinated for root tip chromosome                               
              counts.  Differences between trees and lianas in the                           
              genus will be investigated to see how they have                                
              originated and what anatomical features differentiate                          
              the two life forms.  Both the U.S. and Nicaraguan                              
              sides will benefit from acquiring new data about this                          
              little-known genus.  The U.S. side will gain from                              
              _______ and the Nicaraguan collaborator will acquire                           
              training in modern techniques of systematic biology                            
              and field-oriented research, needed to help train the                          
              next generation of Nicaraguan botanists.
