Abstract    :
                   The object of this research is the transfer of solar and                  
              thermal radiation through cirrus clouds, including the scattering              
              of solar radiation by non-spherical ice particles.  To account                 
              for the distribution of ice particle sizes and their effects on                
              radiative transfer, an effective mean size is proposed.  The                   
              radiative computations will be compared with available                         
              observations.
