Abstract    :
                   The herpetological collection of the Field Museum of Natural              
              History contains 234,000 catalogued representatives of the                     
              world's amphibians and reptiles, including 1,226 types.  The                   
              collection is the fifth largest herpetology collection in the                  
              U.S., and the Museum administration has recently added                         
              significantly to that portion of the building assigned to the                  
              collection.  Dr. Harold Voris, Curator in charge of the                        
              collection, is planning additional storage equipment for this                  
              expansion project, including an ultra-cold freezer for the frozen              
              tissue collection.  New research areas will be constructed and                 
              equipped for visiting scientists, and data from the field note,                
              frozen tissue, and histological slide collections will be added                
              to the collection database.                                                    
                   The proposed improvements to this important herpetology                   
              collection will increase its value to and impact on the research               
              community.  Improvements to the database will make specimens more              
              available for study and loan, and the new lab space for visiting               
              herpetologists will be heavily used.  Natural history collections              
              such as this are the primary resource for studying biological                  
              diversity on earth, and their continued improvement is essential               
              for future generations of researchers.
