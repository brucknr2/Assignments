Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources (ILAR) is a                       
              component of the National Academy of Sciences.  ILAR's program                 
              goal is to provide expert counsel on the scientific, technical,                
              and ethical use of laboratory animals.  ILAR promotes the high-                
              quality and humane care of laboratory animals; the appropriate                 
              use of laboratory animals; and the exploration of alternatives in              
              research, testing and teaching.                                                
                                                                                             
              This award provides partial funding for the core support of ILAR               
              and for ILAR's participation in the International Council for                  
              Laboratory Animal Science (ICLAS).  NIH and U.S. Army provides                 
              the rest of the core support.  The core supports enable ILAR to                
              carry out activities such as providing advice and information on               
              laboratory animal matters to scientists, animal care and use                   
              committees, the federal government, the scientific community, and              
              the public through publication of document, broadening the base                
              of support from non-federal sources, and expanding on educational              
              areas for which ILAR has unique expertise.
