Abstract    :
              This award supports a project to study the motion of                           
              particles in melting snow, under both natural conditions and                   
              in controlled laboratory experiments.  The research has two                    
              primary motivations.  First, this work will aid in                             
              understanding the impact of natural and industrial particle                    
              depositions in the course of snow melt.  Primary focus will                    
              be on elemental carbon particles (soot), because of their                      
              strong effect on radiative properties and their                                
              environmental importance.  Secondly, this work will provide                    
              important information for glaciologists who want to know if                    
              the stability of particle stratigraphy in accumulation areas                   
              of temperate ice caps can be used to find past history of                      
              particle deposition, for example, in relation to biomass                       
              burning or volcanic eruptions.  The field studies will be                      
              undertaken on the Snow Dome of the Blue Glacier, Washington.
