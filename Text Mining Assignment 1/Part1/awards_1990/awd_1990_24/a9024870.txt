Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor J. Spencer to               
              work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate whether certain              
              probabilistic algorithms can be derandomized to give deterministic             
              ones.  He also intends to study threshold functions and Zero-One               
              laws for random structures.                                                    
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
