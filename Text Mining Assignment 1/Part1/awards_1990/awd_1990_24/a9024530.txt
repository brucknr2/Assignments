Abstract    :
                   French Guiana, a small department of France in northeastern               
              South America, still harbors one of the largest expanses of                    
              tropical wilderness in the world.  Situated in the geographic                  
              center of the department, the small village of Saul is surrounded              
              by 133,600 hectares of pristine rainforest proposed as a French                
              national park in 1975.                                                         
                   This project, which is based upon botanical explorations since            
              1976 by the principal investigator and since 1965 by his French                
              collaborators, is designed to produce a flora of the proposed park.            
              The flora will allow scientists and tourists alike to be able to               
              identify the ferns and flowering plants of the park.  As a result,             
              the area will become more valuable as a living laboratory for the              
              study of tropical nature.  It will promote the discovery of                    
              evolutionary relationships in one of the most species rich areas               
              in the world and provide the baseline data needed for the                      
              recuperation of degraded rainforests throughout northeastern South             
              America.                                                                       
                   Another goal of the project is to promote ecotourism in the               
              area by making a visit to the park a more educational experience.              
              The flora will be well illustrated with line drawings and colored              
              photographs, and the keys for plant identification will be made as             
              user friendly as possible.  Editions of the flora will be published            
              in French (edited by the French collaborators) and English.
