Abstract    :
              They propose a scheme to construct and characterize the structure              
              and properties of polymer grain boundaries in a controlled manner.             
              The essential idea is to carefully and systematically establish the            
              influence of well-defined, specific grain boundary defects on the              
              physical properties of polymers.                                               
                                                                                             
              Conventionally processed crystalline polymers have small                       
              crystallites (10-20 nm), which implies a large defect density in               
              the solid state.  Although this means that structural defects play             
              an important or even dominant role in polymer systems, it also                 
              makes it difficult to isolate the effect of a particular devect on             
              a macroscopically observed property.  However, the development of              
              solid-state and thin-film polymerization mechanisms have                       
              facilitated the synthesis of highly organized and ordered polymers.            
              These systems provide a unique opportunity to isolate and                      
              investigate in detail the structure of covalently bonded solids                
              near defects and the effect of these defects on the properties of              
              the material.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              They will examine structure-property relationships in                          
              poly(diacetylene) thin films and crystals.  They describe                      
              procedures for growing  crystals of diacetylene monomers, joining              
              these together to make a grain boundary, and then polymerizing                 
              through the grain boundary by exposure to Co60 radiation.  With this           
              approach it will be possible to prepare "polymer bicrystals".  A               
              simple scheme for measuring the photoconductive response of these              
              bicrystals will be used, a transport property which should depend              
              on the structure of the boundary.  Structural characterization                 
              involving X-ray scattering and Transmission Electron Microscopy                
              (TEM) will be also carried out.
