Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will apply                        
              information theoretic techniques to thermally modulated gas                    
              chromatography.  Approaches previously employed mainly by                      
              spectrocscopists will be used to improve detection limits and                  
              mixture complexity addressable by gas chromatography.  For                     
              simple mixtures, increased speed of analysis will result.                      
              Noise characteristics of injectors, detectors, and modulators                  
              will be considered in designing novel modes of chromatographic                 
              analysis.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              This research will apply Fourier Transform and correlation                     
              signal processing to thermally modulated gas chromatography, a                 
              technique for separating and identifying volatile chemical                     
              species.  Depending on the specific approach and problem,                      
              enhancements to detection or improvements in continuous on-line                
              monitoring of industrial processes should result.
