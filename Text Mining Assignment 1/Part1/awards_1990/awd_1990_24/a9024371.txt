Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              In this project the distribution of large and small particles                  
              will be measured in the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Studies in                
              the Central Equatorial Pacific (EQPAC) to address two of the                   
              five problems being addressed in EQPAC, namely:                                
                                                                                             
              Problem I:  What is the relationship between physical forcing                  
              and upper ocean biogeochemical cycles?                                         
                                                                                             
              Problem IV:  Which processes are responsible for the transport                 
              and regeneration of particulate and dissolved nutrients?                       
                                                                                             
              The work is designed to fill that gap in knowledge by making                   
              high resolution profiles of small particles using                              
              transmissometers and of aggregates using Large Aggregate                       
              Profiling Systems (LAPS).  LAPS profiling is proposed during                   
              the two transect cruises and the two times-series in EQPAC to                  
              contribute to the solution of the above problems.  LAPS also                   
              has a transmissometer and CTD to obtain simultaneous profiles                  
              of beam attenuation (proportional to small particle                            
              concentration), temperature and salinity to compare particle                   
              distributions with water structure.
