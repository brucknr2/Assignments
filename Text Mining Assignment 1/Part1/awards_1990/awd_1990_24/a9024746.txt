Abstract    :
                   Marine bryozoans are important bottom-dwelling animals,                   
              especially where there are solid surfaces like shells, rocks or                
              seaweed for colonies to attach.  The purpose of this project is to             
              carry out a survey and species inventory of the little known marine            
              bryozoan fauna of the northeast coast of the United States.                    
                   Researchers will accomplish this by 1) making new collections             
              in as many locations as possible between Maine and Virginia, 2)                
              analyzing collections made by other scientists working in the area,            
              and 3) examining material already in museums in the region,                    
              especially the type specimens, on which any original descriptions              
              of local species were based, and any still uncataloged specimens               
              they may have.                                                                 
                   By means of the latest scanning electron microscope (SEM) and             
              electronic measuring techniques, all species found will be studied             
              and the findings published.  The result will be an up-to-date                  
              illustrated guide to the marine bryozoans of the northeastern                  
              United States.  It will be of great practical use to biologists                
              studying the increasingly environmentally stressed northeastern                
              coastal zone.  It will be important also to scientists and students            
              interested in bryozoan evolution, providing a current                          
              classification and new descriptions, as well as answering questions            
              about family relationships and geographical distribution.
