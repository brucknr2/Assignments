Abstract    :
              Singh         The goal of this project is to construct an attached  processor
              using application specific integrated circuits.  This  processor will perform
              high speed partial pattern matching of  biological sequence data (such as DNA
              or protein sequences)  against entries in a database.  This processor will
              serve as a  filter to provide information on partial matches (of segments) at 
              a very high speed.  This partial match information is used by the  host
              processor to determine which sequences merit further  detailed comparison
              (i.e., this prefiltering greatly limits the  number of sequences which must be
              subsequently compared when  considering insertions and deletions of
              subsequences).  The  subsequent full match will be carried out in the host
              processor.
