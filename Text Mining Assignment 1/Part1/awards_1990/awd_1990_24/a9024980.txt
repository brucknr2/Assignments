Abstract    :
                   Many threatened and endangered species are being maintained               
              in captive breeding populations, as a method for preserving them               
              for later reintroduction to native habitats.  Most captive                     
              populations have not only been initiated but also maintained in                
              relatively small numbers, so a major concern of captive breeders               
              has been to reduce further erosion of evolutionary adaptability                
              by maintaining maximal genetic variation in the populations.  The              
              effects of various breeding programs or even small population                  
              size per se on maintenance of genetic variation and/or                         
              evolutionary adaptability has not been adequately tested, so we                
              really do not know which breeding programs are best to maintain                
              evolutionarly viable populations.  Evidence has accumulated, for               
              example, that traits important to survival and reproduction in a               
              species may be affected by reduced population size in markedly                 
              different ways than traits currently being assessed in captive                 
              populations.  Specifically, using an experimental organism Dr.                 
              Bryant will investigate the impact of diverse breeding protocols               
              on the genetic variation, current health, and future adaptability              
              of captive populations.  Decisions regarding breeding programs                 
              are currently being made that will irreversibly affect the future              
              of endangered species, and this study will provide critical                    
              information to make appropriate decisions concerning the welfare               
              of these species.
