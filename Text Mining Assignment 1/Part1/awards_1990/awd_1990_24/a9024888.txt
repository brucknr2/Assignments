Abstract    :
              This proposal requests salary subvention for three academic staff              
              members involved in the critical step of editing manuscripts and               
              certain other final costs of preparing The Jepson Manual:  Vascular            
              Plants of California.  The Jepson Manual is a comprehensive,                   
              authoritative, concise, accessible, and up-to-date treatment of the            
              botanically richest region in the United States (ca. 7,800                     
              infrageneric taxa, or at least a quarter of the higher plant taxa              
              of North America outside Mexico).  It has been in preparation for              
              eight years and now involves 180 contributing authors and a staff              
              of seven; it will be published by the end of 1992.  The Jepson                 
              Manual Project is of national significance because of its role in              
              stimulating systematic research, its close relationship to the                 
              Flora of North America Project, the richness and complex                       
              relationships of Californian plant taxa (many of which are endemic             
              or endangered), and its development and use of several new kinds               
              of information.  The single, reasonable priced volume is designed              
              as a bridge between the developers and dispensers of systematic                
              information (systematic botanists) and the highly diverse,                     
              potential users of that information.
