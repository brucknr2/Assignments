Abstract    :
              Dr. David R. McMillin of the Chemistry Department, Purdue                      
              University, is being supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,                 
              and Organometallic Program to investigate coordinately                         
              unsaturated excited states associated with metal complexes                     
              containing 8, 9, or 10 'd' electrons.  Specifically, the                       
              complexes are copper phenanthrolines and porphyrins and                        
              platinum(II) terpyridines.  McMillan will identify the orbitals                
              involved in the excited states and assess the role of                          
              d-orbitals in reactivity.  Absorption spectroscopy, circular                   
              dichroism, and luminescence spectroscopy will be employed and                  
              emission lifetimes and polarization effects will be measured as                
              a function of temperature.  Viscometry will be used in the                     
              DNA-binding studies to help ascertain the binding modes of the                 
              complex.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The objective of the work is to characterize the luminescence                  
              properties of these complexes so that their interaction with a                 
              variety of "hosts" can be assessed.  The excited states of                     
              these complexes are sensitive to their local environment, so                   
              they can be used as structural probes.  McMillan will                          
              investigate their interactions with macromolecules, including                  
              DNA and RNA, and with layered lattices.  The results could have                
              application to catalyst design.
