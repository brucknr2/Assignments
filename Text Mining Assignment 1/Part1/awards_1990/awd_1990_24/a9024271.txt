Abstract    :
              The object of this project is to develop the theory and applications           
              of rewriting.  The Knuth-Bendix completion procedure was originally            
              intended as a means of taking an axiomatization of an equational               
              theory and generating a rewrite system that can be used to decide              
              whether a given equation follows from the others.  Completion may also         
              be used as a theorem-prover when it generates an infinite rewrite              
              system.  This work will extend the inference-rule and proof-                   
              normalization approach developed for completion to the generation of           
              condition rewrite systems and to theorem proving in predicate calculus         
              with equality.  On the more practical side, the semantics of                   
              conditional rewriting will be explored as it applies to the functional         
              and logic programming paradigms, and useful techniques for verifying           
              aspects of program correctness will be developed.
