Abstract    :
                   the largest radio telescope in the United States; called the              
              very large array or the VLA, and the Soviet Union's largest radio              
              telescope, called the RATAN 600, will be used to observe the sun               
              for ten days each year during a three-year period.  This will                  
              lead to a greater understanding of the radiative output of the                 
              sun; it is this output that powers all global changes on the                   
              Earth.  Our joint research project will enhance the scientific                 
              return of both instruments beyond that is expected from using                  
              either one alone.   Spectra and polarization data taken with the               
              RATAN 600 at eleven wavelengths between 0.9 and 20.0 cm will be                
              combined with VLA observations of high angular resolution at 2,                
              3.6, 6, and 20 cm to determine radiation mechanisms and coronal                
              magnetic field strengths for the various sources of intense,                   
              quiescent solar radiation.  ***
