Abstract    :
                   This project will deal with specific free boundary problems               
              arising in industry.  Our objectives are to establish existences,              
              uniqueness, and regularity of the free boundary problems.  Some                
              of the techniques to be used include the minimization of                       
              functionals, fixed point theorem and penalization method.  These               
              methods usually require some a priori estimates.  It is often                  
              difficult to obtain these estimates when the problem becomes very              
              nonlinear, which is often the case for problems related to                     
              industry.  It is our task to overcome the difficulties and reach               
              our objectives.                                                                
                   These problems are of interest to industries such as those                
              developing photocopying machines.
