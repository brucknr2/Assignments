Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a renewal award to support Hampton University                     
              to continue a program, in cooperation with the American Society                
              of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO), to increase the numbers                  
              of underrepresented minorities electing careers in                             
              aquatic sciences and becoming involved in ASLO activities.  The                
              program is targeted at minority students, faculty, and                         
              professionals with interest in aquatic sciences as well as                     
              at majority faculty working at Historically Minority Colleges and              
              Universities (HMCUs).                                                          
                   The proposed activities include: free membership in ASLO                  
              and support to attend annual meetings for three years;                         
              pre-meeting workshop to prepare attendees for active                           
              participation in the meeting; and special sessions during the                  
              meetings for HMCU representatives to make presentations.                       
                   The combined efforts of an HMCU and a professional                        
              society should provide an effective mechanism to attract                       
              minority students and get them actively interested and involved                
              in scientific research and in professional society activities.
