Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigators (PIs)                                              
              plan to investigate the kinetics of                                            
              growth and thiophene production from                                           
              fast-growing hairy root cultures of                                            
              the Tagetes species (marigolds).                                               
              Thiophenes are sulfur derivatives of                                           
              polyacetylenes, and are found mainly                                           
              in the roots of these plants.                                                  
              Recent findings suggest that they                                              
              may play a role in protecting the                                              
              plant from phytopathogenic fungi,                                              
              insects, and nematodes.  Thiophenes                                            
              may, therefore, provide an                                                     
              environmentally safe alternative to                                            
              conventional pesticides.
