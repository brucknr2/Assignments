Abstract    :
                   This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is                  
              made to Dr. Anna Nagurney of the General Business and Finance.                 
              Dr. Nagurney will continue her work in the field of Operations                 
              Research.  In particular she will work on variational                          
              inequalities.

              of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                 
              potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                
              research, the academic profession, and the education of future                 
              scientists.  Dr. Nagurney will continue her work in the field of               
              Operations Research.  Particularly noteworthy is her effort in                 
              bringing women students into the field of Operations Research.
