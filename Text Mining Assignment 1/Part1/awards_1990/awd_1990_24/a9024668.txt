Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to develop static and                        
              dynamic light scattering techniques for the characterization                   
              of fractal soot aggregates in flames.  Current fractal-based                   
              theories for the optical properties of soot particles will be                  
              incorporated in the proposed techniques.  The results from                     
              several static scattering/extinction measurements on soot                      
              clusters will be compared to soot clusters selected from                       
              flames and viewed by an electron micrograph.  The Photon                       
              Correlation Spectroscopy, a dynamic technique to be further                    
              developed by Dr. Sorensen during this project.                                 
                                                                                             
              The research topic is important for scientist understanding of                 
              soot formation and of light scattering diagnostics, and has                    
              engineering applications in combustion and environment.
