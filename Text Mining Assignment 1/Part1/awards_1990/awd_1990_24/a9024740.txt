Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Calcium-activated non-specific cation (CAN) channels play a                    
              crucial role in the generation and modulation of bursting                      
              activity in neurons.  Bursting, the grouping of action potentials              
              in high periodic frequency discharges, is an important neuronal                
              property characteristic of such phenomena as pacemaking and                    
              neurosecretion.  Because CAN channels have a central function in               
              burst generation, their characteristics are significant                        
              determinants in neuron encoding.  The goal of this research                    
              project is to investigate the selectivity and voltage dependence               
              of CAN channels.  Dr. Partridge will study these channels by                   
              using the patch clamp technique, an experimental technique which               
              allows for the study of single channels in isolation.  Studies on              
              how CAN channel activity is modulated by phosphorylation, the                  
              modification of protein structure induced by the attachment of                 
              phosphate groups, will be performed.  This investigation explores              
              basic neuronal properties important to the signalling function in              
              the nervous system.
