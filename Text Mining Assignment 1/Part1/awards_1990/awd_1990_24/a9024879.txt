Abstract    :
                   Nonparametric function estimation is the representation of                
              "noisy" data by a satisfactory smooth function without having to               
              make restrictive assumptions about the function beforehand.  The               
              solution lies between artistically connecting all the data points              
              and inadvertently smoothing out salient features of the data.  This            
              research will investigate possible definitions of the appropriate              
              balance point between these extremes.  Since many functions which              
              differ only slightly may all appear to be satisfactory, definitions            
              of boundaries for "satisfactory function" will also be sought.  In             
              addition, corrective techniques will be devised for technical                  
              problems with estimation using data near the boundaries of the                 
              observable (observed) values.
