Abstract    :
              The School of Oceanography of the University of Washington                     
              will acquire a sea-going data management system and items of                   
              oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of                        
              shared use equipment.  This equipment is maintained for use                    
              on or in association with the research vessels operated by                     
              the University.  The University will take delivery of its new                  
              research vessel THOMAS THOMPSON during 1991 and this                           
              instrumentation will provide some of the basic scientific                      
              capability necessary to support NSF-sponsored research                         
              projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the                          
              capabilities of the institution to support research and                        
              engineering activities.  The instrumentation includes:                         
                                                                                             
              -DECstation 5000 computer system and components for real-time                  
               acquisition, management, analysis, and display of large                       
               environmental and geophysical data sets,                                      
              -Climate control room outfitting to better assure data                         
               quality from samples collected at sea,                                        
              -CTD sensors, pressure gauges, and other enhancements for                      
               obtaining detailed profiles of seawater conductivity and                      
               temperature as a function of depth,                                           
              -Scintillation counter for measurements of radio-isotope                       
                tracers and other chemical parameters,                                       
              -fume hood for removing chemical fumes from the ship's                         
               laboratory                                                                    
              -XBT system for obtaining temperature profiles in the ocean                    
               without having to stop the ship, and                                          
              -Replacement autoclaves for sterilizing glassware and other                    
               tools and for preparing chemical reagents used in                             
               experiments.  These will be for use ashore by all members of                  
               the School of Oceanography.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The University of Washington is cost sharing in the                            
              acquisition of this equipment.  The instrumentation described                  
              above will increase the capability of the University to                        
              support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
