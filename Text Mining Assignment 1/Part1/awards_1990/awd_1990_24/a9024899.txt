Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support continued collaborative research in                    
              nuclear physics between Dr. David Fossan, State University                     
              of New York at Stony Brook, and Drs. R. Wadsworth and P.J.                     
              Nolan, University of York, England.  The objective of the                      
              project is to carry out nuclear structure studies in the                       
              A=130 region.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The investigators will carry out gamma-ray experiments to                      
              study high spin rates in the mass 130 region, using the UK                     
              Science and Engineering Research Council's research laboratory                 
              at Daresbury.  The unique facilities at Daresbury, the 22MV                    
              tandem accelerator coupled with the large TESSA gamma-ray                      
              array and the recoil mass spectrometer, have specific                          
              advantages for the proposed research, such as in statistical                   
              sensitivity and identification. Complimentary spectroscopy                     
              experiments will be carried out at the Stony Brook tandem-                     
              injected superconducting LINAC facility.  Collaboration will                   
              take place out at both laboratories using several experimental                 
              approaches to optimize the sensitivity to important nuclear                    
              structure information.  Analysis and interpretation of these                   
              different experiments will be jointly examined.
