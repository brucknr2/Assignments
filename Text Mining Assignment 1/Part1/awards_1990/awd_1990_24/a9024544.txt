Abstract    :
              The proposed work is part of an integrated research program into               
              the oceanographic structure of the western Weddell Sea.  It is to              
              be carried out from an ice camp jointly occupied by U.S. and USSR              
              scientists from February to June 1992.  This project concerns the              
              determination of the energy exchange between the sea ice cover and             
              the atmospheric boundary layer.                                                
              The objectives are to measure time series of the individual                    
              components of the sea ice/atmosphere energy budget for the duration            
              of the drift, and to determine the bulk transfer coefficients for              
              the exchange of momentum and sensible and latent heat.  The purpose            
              of the measurements is to expand our capability for numerical and              
              analytical modelling of the antarctic environment.  Turbulent                  
              fluctuations in the temperature, wind, and humidity fields will be             
              measured directly with small, fast-responding sensors.  These                  
              observations will be complemented by other synoptic meteorological             
              data and with upper air soundings.
