Abstract    :
              While there are many methods of                                                
              reconstructing images, there is no                                             
              current technique that allows a                                                
              comparison of performance based                                                
              upon a global performance                                                      
              criterion.  This is a proposal to                                              
              develop techniques that will                                                   
              objectively characterize the                                                   
              quality of reconstruction                                                      
              theoretical techniques that take                                               
              into account known statistical                                                 
              characteristics of the images.                                                 
              This novel research may result in a                                            
              way to quantitatively characterize                                             
              different imaging systems using a                                              
              global performance criterion.  The                                             
              work has potential practical                                                   
              usefulness since it may lead to the                                            
              selection of the most cost-                                                    
              effective imaging system for given                                             
              applications.
