Abstract    :
              This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made                  
              to Dr. Patricia A. Thiel of the Chemistry Department, Iowa                     
              State University.  Thiel will continue investigations of                       
              phenomena occurring at metal surfaces, including decomposition                 
              of formic acid, reactions of fluorocarbons, and thin film                      
              growth.  Studies will include the mechanism of formation and                   
              decomposition of oxides at nickel and palladium surfaces.

              The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality of                 
              the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                    
              potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                
              research, the academic profession, and the education of future                 
              scientists.  Particularly noteworthy achievements are studies                  
              concerning the adsorption of water by metals and the structure                 
              of thin films, as well as the education of graduate students.
