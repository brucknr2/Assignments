Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              To develop a comprehensive theory of microscopic quantum tunneling             
              in magnetic systems.  The study will be linked to ongoing                      
              experiments and will include the calculation of tunneling rates for            
              typical forms of magnetic anisotropy and typical geometries of                 
              experiment, effect of magnetic interactions in an ensemble of small            
              ferromagnetic particles, tunneling in presence of time dependent               
              magnetic field, dissipation due to the interaction of the                      
              magnetization with microscopic degrees of freedom,. Also magnetic              
              quantum tunneling in antiferromagnets and spin glasses and                     
              extension of the theory for finite temperature. Also, the PI will              
              continue research on the correlated spin glass theory of amorphous             
              magnet.  The PI plans to extend the theory for amorphous systems               
              with several magnetic sub-networks and fluctuating exchange                    
              interaction, to consider a system of densely packed amorphous                  
              ferromagnetic particles, and to study long wavelength spin                     
              excitations in the correlated spin glass - reentrant phase                     
              transition.
