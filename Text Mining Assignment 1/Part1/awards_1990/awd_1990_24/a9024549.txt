Abstract    :
              Harnessing supercomputer power for computational engineering and               
              science will require massive software systems that support very high           
              level, applications-oriented problem solving environments (PSEs).  Such        
              PSEs will be constructed from software systems from four areas                 
              (Numerical Analysis, Symbolic Computing, Computational Geometry and            
              Artificial Intelligence) which interact currently in a very limited            
              way.  A symbiotic integration of ideas and software from these areas is        
              essential for creating the PSEs required in the future.                        
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to hold a workshop consisting of 15-20          
              people from these areas for a two day intensive study of what has been         
              accomplished so far and to explore the potential for research                  
              developments over the next 4-8 years.  A report on the discussions and         
              conclusions will be prepared.
