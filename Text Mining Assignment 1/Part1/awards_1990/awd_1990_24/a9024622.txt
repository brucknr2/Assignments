Abstract    :
                   This project will study the design and analysis of                        
              algorithms for the solution of large scale optimization problems               
              and nonlinear equations that arise from discretizations of                     
              infinite dimensional problems.  The goals include development of               
              a unifying theory for pointwise quasi-Newton methods, study of                 
              the symmetric rank one method in  infinite dimensions in both the              
              conventional and pointwise contexts, analysis of a new class of                
              methods that use the step in finite difference computation of                  
              gradients as a tool to avoid local minima for problems that are                
              sums of simple smooth functions and small amplitude, high                      
              frequency, noise terms, and globally convergent algorithms for                 
              infinite dimensional problems.                                                 
                   The basic research will be applied to problems in radiative               
              transfer, computer sided design of microwave devices, and                      
              numerical methods for optimization of competitive systems.
