Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Phokion Kolaitis, University of                  
              California, Santa Cruz, to collaborate in applied mathematics with             
              Professor Jouko Vaananen, Department of Mathematics, University of             
              Helsinki, Finland.  They propose to undertake a systematic                     
              investigation of finite model theory from the perspective of                   
              abstract model theory.  The combination of their complementary                 
              expertise in  these areas should produce significant conceptual and            
              theoretical contributions to finite model theory..                             
                                                                                             
              Finite model theory is the study of first-order logic and its                  
              extensions on finite structures.  It is an area of research within             
              logic in computer science that has had numerous interactions with              
              mathematical logic, database theory, and computational complexity.             
              Logicians have developed such a theory of extended logics on                   
              arbitrary structures, known as abstract model theory.  So far no               
              general theory of extended logics on finite structures exists.                 
              The proposed collaborative research will expand the current                    
              framework of this important area of logic.
