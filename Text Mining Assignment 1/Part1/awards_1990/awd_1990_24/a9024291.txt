Abstract    :
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Margerum will                
              continue his studies of the rates and mechanisms of rapid                      
              reactions in aqueous solution.  A number of these reactions are                
              of importance in environmental chemistry.  An apparatus that                   
              allows the study of reactions that are over in a few millionths                
              of a second will be used and improved in this work.                            
                                                                                             
              Mechanistic studies of rapid non-metal redox, hydrolysis, and                  
              disproportionation reactions of halogens and their compounds                   
              with oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur will be examined.  The                       
              importance of halogen-cation transfer mechanisms, the                          
              correlation of reactivities with nucleophilicity, and the                      
              determination of the role of acid-base catalysis will be                       
              emphasized.  The pulsed-accelerated-flow apparatus will be used                
              to monitor the reactions; this instrumentation was developed by                
              the Margerum group, and will be improved by position-resolved                  
              observation.  The latter will incorporate charge-coupled device                
              technology, accelerated flow, and orthogonal observation to                    
              expand the ability to study rapid multi-step and other complex                 
              reactions in solution.
