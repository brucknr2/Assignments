Abstract    :
              Ultraplankton provide 70-80% of the primary productivity of the                
              open oceans.  There are three major groups of ultraplankton (1)                
              prokaryotic organisms; (2) green algae; and (3) golden algae.  The             
              PI proposes to survey the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans              
              for ultraplankton members of the two protistan classes of golden               
              algae---Chrysophyta and Prymnesiophyta, to produce whole mounts and            
              sectioned materials, to culture the collected specimens, to study              
              these specimens and cultures---and cultures already in-hand ---                
              using electron microscopy.  These taxa are seldom collected and                
              even fewer are in culture.  Consequently, little is known about                
              their biology, in spite of their significance in world primary                 
              production.  This study should begin to rectify that lack of                   
              knowledge by cataloging the species and making them available for              
              in-depth studies.
