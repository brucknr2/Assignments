Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with problems in 3-dimensional                  
              manifold theory through the application and extension of                       
              differential geometric methods.  It aims to explore the                        
              classification of non-Haken 3-manifolds and their diffeomorphisms,             
              Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds and universal coverings of 3-               
              manifolds.  The plan is to use the theory of minimal surfaces and              
              of flows and evolution equations to study these problems.  Three-              
              dimensional manifolds are very natural objects of study, inasmuch              
              as the space we live in (ignoring time) has three dimensions, but              
              a surprising amount remains to be learned about them.
