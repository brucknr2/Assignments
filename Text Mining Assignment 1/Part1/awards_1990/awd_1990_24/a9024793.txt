Abstract    :
                   Analytic methods for Bayesian analysis hinge upon the                     
              "posterior distribution" as the representation for the accumulated             
              information upon observation of the data.  For many observational              
              studies as well as many or most experimental situations, an                    
              adequate analysis depends on representing complicated information              
              in a satisfactory way.  Advances in computational techniques,                  
              notably adaptive Monte-Carlo integration, have begun to make the               
              reconstruction of suitable posterior distributions possible.                   
                   This research will extend the range of existing methods both              
              by incorporating quantile integration to increase efficiency and by            
              formulating the distribution approximation problem in terms of                 
              mixture distributions and then imposing a clustering approach to               
              gain efficiency.
