Abstract    :
                   The PI proposed to continue research during the tenure of the             
              FAW award along the following lines:  the evolution of foreland                
              basins with emphasis on the Mediterranean region, including the                
              Apennines, Hellenides, and Carpathians.  These studies provide                 
              information on the mechanical response of the lithosphere and                  
              mechanism of subduction, as well as the variation in sedimentary               
              styles as a function of tectonics and subduction dynamics; the                 
              evolution of back-arc extensional basins, especially in the Aegean             
              region of Greece, as they progress toward and interfere with,                  
              younger tectonic systems of eastern Europe; the thermal structure              
              of orogenic belts using theoretical models constrained by                      
              structural and metamorphic data; and finally to investigate the                
              role of regional scale flow in the lower crust, and complying to               
              the mantle and upper crust, in areas of continental deformation.
