Abstract    :
              Unemployment Insurance (UI) is an important an expensive program.              
              In 1987, over 2.0 million people received unemployment insurance               
              each week at a cost of 15.1 billion dollars.  Workers'                         
              Compensation (WC) is an increasingly expensive program that                    
              currently costs almost twice as much as the Unemployment                       
              Insurance Program.  Between 1970 and 1987, WC benefit payments                 
              rose at an annual rate of 7% after accounting for inflation.  In               
              1987, total benefit payments reached $27.4 billion, with an                    
              insurance cost to employers of more than $34 billion.                          
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this research is to assess the effects of higher                
              UI and WC benefits by examining people who file just before and                
              just after increases in benefits.  These natural experiments                   
              provide exogenous changes in benefits that can be related to a                 
              number of outcomes.  The WC study includes an examination of                   
              medical cost containment, post-injury health and earnings, and                 
              income distribution effects.  The UI study includes an                         
              examination of UI experience rating and its relationship to                    
              layoffs and recalls, the concentration of UI receipts in certain               
              individuals and firms, and firm histories of layoffs and recalls.              
              An important part of this study is the documentation of a large                
              data set, containing over 30 million records, which provides a                 
              nearly ideal source to analyze these and other questions.
