Abstract    :
              The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop a                 
              unified approach to seismic hazard and risk evaluation.  This                  
              objective will be achieved through the following tasks: 1) Advances            
              on segmentation models of faults will provide the basis for                    
              developing spatially dependent earthquake occurrence models which              
              have not been previously considered.  Additional information of the            
              state of stress and strain release rates along faults will aid in              
              the development of key parameters for such a model.  2) A                      
              geophysical ground motion simulation model will be combined with               
              the earthquake occurrence model for site hazard estimates.  The                
              normal mode method was successfully used in a previous NSF-                    
              supported research project.  Other methods such the ray tracing,               
              elasto-dynamic Green's functions, and empirical Green's functions              
              will be reviewed to determine their suitability for implementation.            
              3) Ground motions simulated under task 2 will be for firm ground               
              conditions.  To reflect the effect of local soil conditions on the             
              simulated ground motions, a one-dimensional linear soil will be                
              sued to predict motions at the ground surface.  4) The damage                  
              potential of structures will be represented through a global damage            
              index which reflects the overall structural behavior.  However, a              
              damage index for structural components or subassemblies will be                
              developed in terms of the ratio of the maximum response parameter              
              to a cumulative response parameter.  A measure of the energy                   
              dissipation of the structure through stiffness degradation will be             
              used to define this index.
