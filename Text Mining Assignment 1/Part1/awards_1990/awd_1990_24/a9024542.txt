Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Poland research project                       
              between Dr. John Mulvey of Princeton University and Dr.                        
              Andrzey Ruszczynski of Warsaw University of Technology is                      
              to study computational methods for solving large-scale                         
              optimization problems that have a dynamic structure and                        
              uncertain parameters.  The researchers intend to focus on                      
              decomposition-type methods which split problems into                           
              smaller parts corresponding to time stages or scenarios.                       
              They plan to employ the following methods:  1) primal and                      
              dual decomposition with the application of regularization                      
              and augmented Lagrangians and 2) special versions of                           
              barrier or interior point methods.  The results of this                        
              project in linear programming are expected to open new                         
              possibilities for solving large-multistage stochastic                          
              programming problems.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This project in computer science research fulfills the                         
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                         
              enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe                       
              to combine complementary talents and pool research                             
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                               
              competence.
