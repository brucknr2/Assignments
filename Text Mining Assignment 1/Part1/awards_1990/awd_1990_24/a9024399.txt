Abstract    :
                   Strategic planning in ecology is important and timely.  New               
              technologies, interdisciplinary challenges, and significant                    
              progress on many ecological fronts provide exciting opportunities              
              for advances in the 1990's.  Furthermore, urgent problems such as              
              environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity,  and change in                
              global climate emphasize the need for sound ecological                         
              information and understanding.  Resources to obtain this basic                 
              ecological knowledge are limited, and a comprehensive evaluation               
              of research priorities is therefore crucial for the wise use of                
              research support.                                                              
                   The Ecological Society of America will publish the revised                
              report "The Sustainable Biosphere Initiative:  An Ecological                   
              Research Agenda for the Nineties" with funding provided by this                
              award.  In addition the Society will conduct a workshop to plan                
              the further dissemination of the report and to organize                        
              subsequent, topical workshops which will further define the                    
              research opportunities, needs and priorities for the 1990's.                   
              These activities will provide valuable input for the ecological                
              science community and for the federal government as both strive                
              to improve the base for more cost effective research in ecology//
