Abstract    :
                   Mills College will develop and operate a 6-week program for 24            
              women undergraduates, selected nationwide, which will provide them             
              with an intensive immersion in mathematics designed to motivate                
              them, and strengthen their preparation, for entrance into a                    
              mathematics Ph.D. program after graduation.  The program will also             
              broaden and strengthen the efforts of the nation's mathematics                 
              faculty to encourage more women to major in mathematics and to                 
              direct the most promising ones toward graduate school.  The program            
              will also encourage participating students to serve as leaders in              
              mathematical activities among their peers at their own institution.            
              Finally, data will be gathered and analyzed with a view to                     
              clarifying the reasons why many fewer women mathematics majors than            
              men now go on to Ph.D. programs in mathematics.
