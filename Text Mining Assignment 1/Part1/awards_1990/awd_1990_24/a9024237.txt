Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to determine what role                         
              technological change has played in affecting postwar domestic and              
              world business cycles.  Previous research has suggested that if                
              such technological shocks were the only source of fluctuation,                 
              the variability of the aggregate U.S. economy would have been                  
              only about two-thirds as large as what has been observed.  This                
              project will investigate the sensitivity of those estimates to                 
              factors that have not yet been taken into account in a systematic              
              way.  A major factor is the role of international trade and the                
              related question of how correlated domestic and foreign shocks                 
              are, and whether there are spill-over effects in technology                    
              across countries.  Another important factor is human capital                   
              accumulation.  A third is the role of consumer durables, an                    
              important component of aggregate output, which has received                    
              relatively little attention in real business cycle models.  The                
              strategy is both to construct computable general equilibrium                   
              models that can be used to perform laboratory experiments and to               
              do measurements that are important for quantitatively restricting              
              these models and, thus, improving the reliability of the answers               
              to the questions being addressed.  This research is important                  
              because it will increase our understanding of how technological                
              change may influence the business cycle.
