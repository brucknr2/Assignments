Abstract    :
              Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM) provides the capability                     
              to obtain information in a nondestructive mode on the                          
              elastic properties of materials at a resolution comparable                     
              to that of high magnification optical microscopy.  SAM also                    
              permits such studies in materials opaque to light, thus                        
              allowing studies of sub-surface as well as surface                             
              properties.  Structure-property measurements at high                           
              resolution are important in attempting to understand the                       
              distribution of local inhomogeneities, both surface and                        
              sub-surface, on bone properties.  SAM is also important to                     
              improve the understanding of the effects of implants at                        
              bone-implant interfaces.  Finite element analyses (FEA) are                    
              being used by many people in their attempts to design new                      
              implant prostheses, and data obtained by SAM are expected                      
              to dramatically improve such design calculations.
