Abstract    :
                   This research is in the area of probability and involves the              
              limit theorems for real and vector valued random variables with                
              emphasis on the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) and the                    
              Gaussian central limit theorem (CLT).  In particular, problems                 
              related to the CLT and LIL motivated by trimming and self-                     
              normalizations will be studied.  The second order behavior of                  
              Gaussian random vectors and limit sets for random samples of                   
              processes, as well as coverage problems, will be examined.  Other              
              items under consideration concern vector valued partial sums,                  
              empirical processes, and the rates of growth, local asymptotics,               
              and rates of escape for Banach space valued Brownian motion.                   
                   The central theme in probability, and throughout its diverse              
              applications to problems in engineering, physics, and statistics,              
              is the study of limit theorems for partial sums of random                      
              variables in both finite and infinite dimensional settings.  Of                
              primary importance is the strong law of large numbers (SLLN), the              
              central limit theorem (CLT), and the rate of convergence for the               
              SLLN, namely the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL).  This                    
              research project will be concentrated on the study of these limit              
              theorems.
