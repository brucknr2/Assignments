Abstract    :
              This award funds the first of a two year continuing grant.  The                
              PI has developed an object recognition method based on hash                    
              tables for indexing and rapid retrieval of encoded models.  He                 
              proposed to perfect the method for flat (2D) objects, implement                
              it on a Connection Machine, and move to noisy data, texture, and               
              highly cluttered scenes; and also to generalize the method to 3D               
              objects, using the splash as the basic data representation.  The               
              goal of this research is more efficient and robust object                      
              recognition.
