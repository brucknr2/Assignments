Abstract    :
              The research extends the current work in human supervisory control             
              of computer-integrated manufacturing systems.  This research seeks             
              to understand the proper role of the human operator in                         
              sophisticated manufacturing systems, and given that understanding,             
              to develop computer-based intelligent workstations and operator                
              associates to the human operator responsible for system safety and             
              productivity.  In particular, the research addresses three critical            
              facets:  the development of models of human supervisory operators              
              in manufacturing systems; strategies and methods for integrating               
              analytic methods and knowledge-based tools for decision support;               
              and the creation of an experimental, laboratory environment to test            
              candidate human supervisory controls systems.
