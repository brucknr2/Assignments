Abstract    :
              Osteryoung is a leading electroanalytical chemist.  Her work                   
              under this grant from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                     
              Program in the Chemistry Division will study quantitative                      
              analysis of benzodiazepines (tranquilizers), sequestration into                
              microspheres of species liberated by electrolysis, interactions                
              of ions with cyclodextrins (size and shape selective reagents),                
              and formation of thin films by electrolysis.  Fields benefiting                
              from this work will include pharmacoanalysis, enzyme modeling,                 
              high-temperature superconductivity, and fundamental                            
              electrochemistry.                                                              
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              Specific experiments include observation of complexation of                    
              ferrocenecarboxylic acid by cyclodextrins, complexation of heme                
              groups by cyclodextrins, development of methods for                            
              benzodiazepines in non-aqueous solvents (which, if used in                     
              conjunction with extractions should reduce interferences                       
              compared to current methods), use of mono-disperse spheres                     
              toprovide constant diffusion coefficients for a variety of                     
              species so that their rate of evolution in the electrode double                
              layer can be definitively measured, and electrocrystallization                 
              of high temperature Ba-Cu-O superconductors.
