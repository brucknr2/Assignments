Abstract    :
                   This project centers around an analysis of the algebraic                  
              properties of the solutions of linear differential equations with              
              polynomial coefficients and the development of algorithms based                
              upon this analysis that can be used to construct  improved                     
              interpolation schemes.  In particular, the principal investigator              
              will use the theory of galois groups to solve linear differential              
              equations in terms of special functions.  He will study also the               
              algebraic structure of these special functions with a view to                  
              improving algorithms for integration of the differential equation              
              in finite terms.  And finally he will employ techniques from the               
              algebraic theory of differential equations to develop improved                 
              interpolation formulas for sparse polynomials and rational                     
              functions.
