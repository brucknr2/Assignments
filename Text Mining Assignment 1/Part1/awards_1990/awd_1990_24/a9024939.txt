Abstract    :
                   This award is concerned with the theory of                                
              finitedimensional division algebras and the theory of Dubrovin                 
              valuation rings.  Problems in finite dimensional division                      
              algebras will be considered by using valuation theory, both                    
              the classical valuation theory of division algebras and the                    
              recently developing theory of Dubrovin valuation rings.                        
              Specifically, the principal investigator will work on the                      
              structure of non-tame division algebras over Henselian valued                  
              fields and the structure of defective division algebras.  He                   
              will also develop a global theory of Dubrovin valuation                        
              domains.                                                                       
                   A ring is an algebraic object having an addition and a                    
              multiplication defined on it.  Rings occur naturally in many                   
              different settings in mathematics.  This research is concerned                 
              with an important class of rings called division algebras.
