Abstract    :
              Over the last decade, much progress has been made towards                      
              understanding the physics of two-dimensional (2-D) systems.  Their             
              goal is to pursue a new set of interesting phenomena associated                
              with such systems:  the escape of electrons out of the 2-D layer.              
              This escape involves tunneling of an electron through a barrier                
              whose parameters are determined by interactions with the                       
              environment.  It is therefore extremely sensitive to correlations,             
              the presence of an electromagnetic field or interactions with                  
              elementary excitations (e.g. ripplons, phonons) in coupled systems.            
                                                                                             
              This research will contribute to understanding many other systems              
              where escape in the presence of interactions is encountered, as in             
              atomic physics, electron transport in semiconductors, diffusion in             
              solids, etc.
