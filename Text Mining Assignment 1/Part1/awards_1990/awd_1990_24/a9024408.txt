Abstract    :
                   This project will consider cooperative and stochastic games.              
              For cooperative games, questions related to Shapley value will be              
              analyzed when the players are assumed to join coalitions with                  
              varying levels of effort or sincerity.  In addition, the notion                
              of potential function for this kind of games will be considered.               
              For stochastic games, the existence of efficient algorithms and                
              equilibria will be studied.                                                    
                   Models developed in this project apply to a many                          
              phenomena in areas such as economics, finance, social and                      
              military science.  Due to the generality of the methods a vast                 
              area of knowledge is to benefit from the results of this grant.
