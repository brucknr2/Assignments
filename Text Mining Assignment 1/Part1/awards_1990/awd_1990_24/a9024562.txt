Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action provides support for travel of U.S. scientists to                  
              Russia to discuss diffusion and defects in solids in an informal               
              type of atmosphere in June 1991.  Topics of the conference include             
              intergranular diffusion, diffusional processes in new materials,               
              defects and radiation effects, and applications of diffusion                   
              theory.  Scientists from Western and Eastern Europe will attend in             
              addition to the U.S. scientists. Approximately 25 scientists from              
              the U.S. have expressed interest in attending.  Young scientists               
              would be included in the group supported.
