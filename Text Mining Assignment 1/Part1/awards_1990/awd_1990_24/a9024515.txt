Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research project supports an anthropology                    
              student from Stanford University studying how people in British                
              society interpret racial differences, in light of the upcoming                 
              national census in that country where racial identity will be                  
              recorded for the first time.  Using an ethnographic methodology,               
              the student (who is Black) and a research assistant (who will be               
              White) will study how people living in Liverpool use concepts of               
              national identity like "Englishness" as implicitly racial terms,               
              as well as explicitly racial terms like "Asian" and "Black".  In               
              depth interviews will be conducted with community activists and                
              census officials on the political controversy over racial                      
              categories in the census as well as with a sample of individual                
              life histories focusing on their perceptions of race in British                
              history.  The investigators will also observe the teaching of                  
              British history in a senior (high) school.                                     
                                                                                             
              This project is significant because it attempts to understand how              
              a democratic society similar to ours experiences racial change in              
              their population.  Understanding how race and nationality are                  
              experienced in a similar but less racially mixed situation will                
              help us understand the sources of our own values and behavior.
