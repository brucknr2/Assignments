Abstract    :
                   The Mollusc Collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of                
              Natural History contains more than 400,000 lots and 1,100 types,               
              and is the largest such collection in the western U. S.  These                 
              specimens are probably the world's best representation of the                  
              molluscs of the eastern Pacific.  Dr. James McLean, Curator in                 
              charge of the collection, has overseen its substantial growth                  
              during the past ten years, and he now proposes to complete                     
              computerization and curation of the Eastern Pacific gastropods in              
              the next two years.  Data entry will be completed for                          
              approximately 97,000 lots, and a significant private collection                
              of Alaskan specimens will be integrated into the collection.                   
                   Dr. McLean's curatorial project will have a significant                   
              impact on the research community.  Access to specimens in this                 
              important collection will be improved substantially, and                       
              incorporating the Alaskan material will improve the collection's               
              coverage of the Eastern Pacific.  Reference collections such as                
              this are critical resources for research in evolution, ecology,                
              biogeography, global change, and many other disciplines.  The                  
              continued growth and maintenance of these collections is                       
              essential for future generations of biological research.
