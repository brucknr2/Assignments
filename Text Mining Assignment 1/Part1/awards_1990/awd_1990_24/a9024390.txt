Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fiber optic sensors embedded into reinforced                                   
              concrete will be tested as evaluators of                                       
              material integrity and the structural                                          
              response to extreme loads, and as detectors                                    
              of stresses that, in turn, would activate                                      
              control systems.  The project will develop                                     
              and examine coatings and claddings for the                                     
              fibers to minimize fragility and degradation,                                  
              test the underlying principles of distributed                                  
              multi-mode vibration sensing, and develop                                      
              techniques for embedding and optically                                         
              multiplexing multiple fiber optic point                                        
              pressure sensors on a single fiber.  The                                       
              results will be applied to the development of                                  
              "intelligent" buildings and other types of                                     
              construction, in which multiplexed sensors                                     
              are incorporated into their structure to                                       
              detect failure, measure behavior and feed                                      
              back to control systems that preserve                                          
              building's integrity.  The benefits of the                                     
              work is to increase public safety and to                                       
              decrease damage to and destruction of                                          
              buildings and structures subjected to extreme                                  
              natural hazards such as hurricanes and                                         
              earthquakes.
