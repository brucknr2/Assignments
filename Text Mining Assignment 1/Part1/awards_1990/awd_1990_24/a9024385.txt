              A joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Workshop on Algebraic Groups                             
              and Related Number Theory, organized by Armand                                 
              Borel of the Institute of Advanced Study (Princeton,                           
              New Jersey) and V.P. Platonov of the Institute of                              
              Mathematics, Byelorussian Academy of Sciences                                  
              (Minsk, U.S.S.R.), will take place in Minsk, May                               
              20-27, 1991.  The meeting will bring together                                  
              mathematicians from both countries who have made                               
              leading contributions to some of the most promising                            
              aspects of algebraic group theory for the purpose                              
              of fostering further progress through new long-                                
              range cooperative research projects.  The Soviet                               
              Union and the United States are among the world                                
              leaders in this important branch of mathematics.                               
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of                                 
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                             
              researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to                           
              combine complementary efforts and capabilities in                              
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the                          
              field of basic scientific research on the basis of                             
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
