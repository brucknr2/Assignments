Abstract    :
                   Plasma diagnostic techniques based on laser induced                       
              fluorescence are used to study transport characteristics in a                  
              fully ionized plasma.  A recently developed method for                         
              determining locally averaged electric field, from ion                          
              acceleration data, is used to make experimental determinations of              
              the Fokker-Planck coefficients under various plasma conditions,                
              for comparison with theory.
