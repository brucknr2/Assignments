Abstract    :
                   String theories and conformal field theories have had a                   
              remarkable impact on mathematics, as well as having a profound                 
              effect in turning a generation of young theoretical physicists                 
              toward mathematics.  The mathematical developments deriving from               
              string theories and conformal field theories have been truly                   
              prodigious, with new applications from algebraic geometry,                     
              representations of infinite dimensional algebras, quantum groups,              
              Riemann surfaces, non-commutative geometry, topology and knot                  
              theory.                                                                        
                   This grant will partially support a conference on Differential            
              Geometric Methods in Theoretical Physics at Baruch College in June,            
              1991.  In addition to attracting the world leaders in these areas,             
              who will interact in a stimulating research atmosphere, this                   
              conference will provide undergraduates and honor high school                   
              students with the opportunity to participate in specially designed             
              expository lectures and panel discussions with the assembled                   
              experts.
