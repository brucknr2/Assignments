Abstract    :
                   This proposal requests support for the continued development              
              and operation of several lidar systems that are currently being                
              used to explore the stratosphere, mesosphere and lower                         
              thermosphere.  These lidars systems include the CEDAR resonance                
              fluorescence lidar, the new Na temperature/Doppler wind lidar and              
              a powerful new Rayleigh lidar that is proposed for construction                
              during the first year of the project.***//
