Abstract    :
                   Continuous-fiber reinforced plastics are superior mechanically            
              to short-fiber reinforced plastics.  However, components fabricated            
              from continuously reinforced plastics are labor-intensive, time                
              consuming and expensive.  In phase I and in response to industrial             
              demand, an innovative system to mold quality, discontinuous long-              
              fiber, reinforced plastic products to net dimension was developed.             
              Results of the American Society of Testing Materials test specimens            
              molded from either virgin or virgin/recycled materials and scanning            
              electron microscope and ashing data, substantiate the advantageous             
              mechanical/physical performance of such composite components.  The             
              mechanical advantages were achieved without sacrificing the design             
              and processing flexibilities or economical advantages of using                 
              short-fiber composites.  The use of recycled feed-stock also has               
              favorable environmental implications.                                          
                   In phase II the pioneer equipment will be developed into a                
              prototype system for its commercialization and that of its                     
              products.  The use of other virgin and recycled feed-stock                     
              materials will be evaluated and process optimization for molding               
              various materials into industrial products will be conducted.
