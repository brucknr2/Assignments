Abstract    :
                   This project is a model-based scientific investigation with               
              several tasks that directly support TOGA/COARE objectives.                     
              Mesoscale model development and testing will be focussed in two                
              areas.  First, the convective parameterization in the Penn                     
              State/NCAR mesoscale model will be tested for the equatorial                   
              maritime region of the TOGA COARE IOP, and modified appropriately              
              to allow it to accurately simulate tropical convection.                        
              Secondly, an existing four-dimensional data assimilation scheme                
              will be modified for use in the tropics so that the special field              
              program data can be used to more effectively initialize the                    
              mesoscale model.  In addition, this data-assimilation program                  
              will be evaluated as a tool for generation of gridded model-                   
              assimilated mesoscale data sets based on the TOGA COARE                        
              observations.  Sensitivity studies with the mesoscale model, and               
              analysis of the model-assimilated data sets, will then be                      
              performed to determine how tropical deep convection interacts                  
              with its large scale oceanic and atmospheric environment.  This                
              research is important because it serves as one of the studies of               
              TOGA/COARE that links convective scale physical processes to the               
              larger scales that impact climate variability in an especially                 
              climate sensitive region of the world, the western Pacific                     
              Ocean, the field site of TOGA COARE.
