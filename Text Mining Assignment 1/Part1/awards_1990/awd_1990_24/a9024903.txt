Abstract    :
              One of the important global changes of the Cenozoic took                       
              place during the late Tertiary (Neogene) when the climate of                   
              the present arctic region shifted from warm temperate to sub                   
              arctic.  This award supports the study of two sedimentary                      
              sequences in southern Alaska that record the cooling trend                     
              near the Arctic Circle during the Miocene.  These sediments                    
              represent almost continuous deposition from about 24 to 4                      
              million years ago (Ma), and include a detailed record of the                   
              cooling from ca.16-5Ma.  This project will integrate the                       
              results of pollen analyses and fossil leaf studies to                          
              reconstruct a detailed vegetation and climate chronology of                    
              the Miocene and early Pliocene for southern Alaska.  The                       
              objective is to build a climate curve based on the ratio of                    
              warm-loving and cool-loving plants for each section.  The                      
              detailed pollen and climate chronology can help establish a                    
              base-line datum of use in interpreting marine data for the                     
              Neogene of the North Pacific rim.
