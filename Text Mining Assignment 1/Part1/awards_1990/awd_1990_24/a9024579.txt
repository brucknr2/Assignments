Abstract    :
              The Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) was                  
              established in 1966 by the International Council of Scientific                 
              Unions (ICSU).  Working on an interdisciplinary basis, CODATA seeks            
              to improve the quality, reliability, processing, management, and               
              accessibility of data of importance to science and technology.  The            
              CODATA Task Group on Coordination of Protein Sequence Data Banks               
              was established in 1984 to provide a forum to gather information               
              on existing protein databases and to further stimulate                         
              international cooperation in the development and operation of such             
              databases.  In 1988 the scope of the task group was expanded to                
              include other macromolecular databases and the group was                       
              reconstituted as the CODATA Task Group on Biological                           
              Macromolecules.  Its mission is to promote cooperation among                   
              biomolecular databases.  To this end, the Task Group meets                     
              annually.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The 1991 meeting, to be held at Georgetown University, will allow              
              an international gathering of experts to exchange ideas on the                 
              meeting's general theme: a rational approach towards the                       
              development of infrastructures for the accumulation, integration,              
              and dissemination of biological information.  In additional to the             
              general theme, sessions will be dedicated to discussions of NMR                
              databases, structural databases, sequence databases, and emergent              
              databases.  A session will also be devoted to planning the                     
              continuing activities of the task group.
