Abstract    :
              The investigators will sample the inquilines that are found in the             
              nests of ants and termites in three general areas of North                     
              Queensland, Australia.  These areas are the Iron Range, the top                
              end of the York Peninsula, and the area around Cape Tribulation.               
              The inquilines (usually called myrmecophiles and termitophiles)                
              belong to a wide variety of taxonomic groups and exhibit a wide                
              variety of ecological relationships to the ants and termites                   
              ranging from parasites to detritus feeders that clean up the                   
              kitchen middens of the nests.  The significance of this proposed               
              expedition lies in the creation of collections of specimens and                
              data which will be used in future research by the investigators and            
              by many other taxonomic experts.  Specific projects which will                 
              benefit immediately are the revision of the Termitonannini                     
              (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae), the revision of the Dorylomimini                  
              (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae), and the revision of the Phoridae                  
              (Diptera).   The project will increase the scientific resources of             
              the United States and Australia through the increase of our samples            
              of insects from hard to sample, and unique areas.
